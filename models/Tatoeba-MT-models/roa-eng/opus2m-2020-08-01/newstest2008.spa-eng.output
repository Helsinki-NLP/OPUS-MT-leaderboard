European inflation has slipped in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the sharp increase in the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced by the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave as likely 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped 22: "there is to negotiate" on inflation so that it will not have to intervene later on on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, hit the 12-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Contributions to the wheat term increased by 88 per cent and soy quotas have also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 per barrel of black gold last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 percent current to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup had never before experienced such a low - 13 percent - level in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the strongest of the voters of the opposition - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against the support of one fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is about two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 per cent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is experiencing the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth party expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was rather ill-functioning than well-functioning.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 per cent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the disturbances in October last year 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said that it is likely that they will participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population would participate safely and another 15 per cent would believe that they would participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of education rights, 79 per cent of the medical services and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of education rights, payment for medical consultations and the payment of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of 16 per cent remained the hypermarkets of the Budaörs commercial gold triangle, with the difference that this year VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the thousand HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so there was no dramatic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is evidently frightening for consumers that what they could buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUFs, today they can't even do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-liter refillable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the Napi Auchan basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, in relation to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas prices the increase in VAT was felt.
Just this process was the one that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important benefit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only an 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent of the price of consumer goods of primary need grew.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the Central Statistical Office's figures: this office, in the case of some necessities, recorded a price increase of over 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases only 10 percent of price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose the drastic price increase even to multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experience, most consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all products buy large quantities, taking preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, large queues were formed in the three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been reported in hospitals primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, bed overcrowding and staff overload do not favor the control of infections - says the medical-chief department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are saved.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early this year.
A victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and no major surgical intervention has been performed since then because of the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10th of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, the head doctor of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, but no information is available.
Almost two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, namely Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxacillin-resistant.
One third of humans carry on their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e. g.: sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once the antibiotics are applied over or improperly, the bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and quickly become infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to the elderly or to people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic Resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff attends them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to avoid infection in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - Karolina Böröcz says.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients with MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological samples are not fashionable.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases go out to the public when there are already visible MRSA infections in the patient - said the head doctor of the epidemiological center department.
The European Union is making strict commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological frameworks.
Antibiotic therapy should be used, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of travelling patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks is a very important role, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drop transmission and direct contact between individuals, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, one can also experience - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic conditions it is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are carried out, fewer infections of this kind are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
According to the data provided, MRSA infections appear to have a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the 21st District Police Commander.
It may be ruled out the possibility that he had been drunk or in a state in which he had since resigned police commander of District XXII, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a transgender - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the steering wheel.
The then chief of the police station in district XXII, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle as he doubled to the street Kossuth Lajos in district XXII, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way by bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and applied for retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case investigation is under the responsibility of the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest for a total of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, to be made from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract that they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later in the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the Metro financing, they will again deal with the issue whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this will take place early in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, that will grow faster?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach cottages.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estates in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of the real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, Sofia's capital may be attractive, both commercial and office spaces promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter.
Therefore, precave investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Also present are Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is chalets buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 German holiday destinations).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Foundor, expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministers-level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Discussions on the particulars between developing and industrialized countries are currently under way.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on accurate figures at the moment, although it tends to reach the agreement that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, it decreases by 25 to 40 per cent the emission of greenhouse gases.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member steering board, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac é Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent to 2020, regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to a reduction of even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which 15 EU Member States committed to achieving 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will implement - notes the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
This is much at stake in Bali, since within two years the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
In this way, emission reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the Earth's average temperature could not be prevented, since according to scientists, it would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers who have been loaded this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence leaders" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally uploaded the videos with recruitment goals, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also served to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda almost cost nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - told the BBC the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - but inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans have prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the anxiously edited and censored recordings, videos are also featured in the distributor, for example, about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak at most of the losses, although they do not present the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in actual operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with video game shooting, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tomb and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you have fun power.
The State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited to the families of the soldiers who currently perform missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred Ministry workers are expected to be around 300.
At the party of the portfolio there will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, they will also act artists and there will be a tombol draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the departments of the NF are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedia Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also the one of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifteen hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the words of greeting from the minister and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to [origo]’s question they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to dress suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect her colleagues to attend an official Christmas party, but rather for an end-of-year working meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will only take coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Governments and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief address of greetings from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
Gathering the forces of the giant strike
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the unemployment will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail transit will be stopped completely and workers of the Collective Transport Company in Budapest will also be on strike by 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Trade Union of Machines will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will pronounce on strike for an indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only public health law may be voted on at very late hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike to be launched on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: railways will cease to work indefinitely, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the inter-urban bus transport of the Volan companies may be stopped.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a defined time.
Until Thursday evening the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, but as Christmas parties approached, more and more people were traveling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. workers from the Collective Transport Company in Budapest will be on strike, Budapest airports from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike at the Liga Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy Unions, the Educators' Unions will call for a 2 p.m. strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which forms part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that early pensions may be allowed to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk by the Hungarian Guard is increased
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity the greatest political risk is that "with the worsening of the ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of such an event - added the representative of the Research Institute.
They stated that this was due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave public debate of the Roma problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the differences between Roma and Hungarians".
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of the country's stability and democratic development".
They remind us that since the fall of 2006 there has been increasing publicity and momentum for the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 there have been numerous organizations that have self-defended "national self-defence associations" in the country.
"The common feature of these groups is that they self-definite themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for the defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, defense of the public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is the state" - they add.
They said: all of this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
To highlight the civil and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighboring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have been increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in such a way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations which certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced will be their own guard to resist.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Capital Policy.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász to the news agency's question stated: Risk analysis is one of the research institutes' activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America are the parties united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, state parties and holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who have spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the 1848 and 23 October revolution, a commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November we remind our family and friends who died.
In addition, in our country are two-day parties the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often made a bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends so, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public servants.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, because of their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work may be altered only around the parties of the end of the year: from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, because according to experiences, most people "make bridges" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with middle or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be modified around the work party so that, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the party on October 23rd: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the end-of-year party can rest, since from 24 December it will not be worked in almost any part of the year, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissuasives to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to the small discomforts or consciously avoid situations that might irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a date?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might as well call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding with ridiculous explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitterness the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find it.
You remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your missing pen on one of your colleagues' table?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly get mad at you for removing their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out before time.
Chismeas about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good way to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have on the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your partner's trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know about him.
Are you going on sick leave unwarranted?
When you call the office on the phone and say you're sick and you're unbearably hurt your head, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think that others should do your work, your unstoppable tasks, your work in the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something will happen to you, so you have to stay at home, tell them, so your colleagues or your boss won't have to face up to you the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, phone calls
You're in your job, but you're suddenly getting rid of him of the risillas of your colleagues?
Have you accidentally heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarares, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them over their heads), flattery, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
You blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: I was very comfortable for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation permits it!
Don't be rude, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Loss of interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
It sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll raise the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the earlier tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true gem intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love song in Zagar.
National musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different this block when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and even though the rock style garage, breaks guitars again, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public knew the whole that in the beginning acted only in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of selling itself also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released record entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radios the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Well everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be equally composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, lightweight music has larger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen-and-twenty-year generations attend concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, trust the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that our work would compare with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and then started another way.
hvg.hu: On the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our album.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of sound soloists from our own national musical stage.
This is how the choir of six women was created - Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodasi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - which was then named Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly compose the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together and not more strongly than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply because of technical problems.
We consciously didn't want to distribute papers as soloists.
The song also tells us about it, that we forget for a while our ego, who from where it has come and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others too feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, but when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything was put in place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with concerts and because I've already "released" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous bag runner risks billions for its inferiority complex
An disloyal evildoer.
This is what his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Generale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good skills.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones that were sent to the police.
But what comes from Kerviel's responses, according to what French media translates, like Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of over 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the US crisis, €500 million.
This opportunity has already seen her coming early in the year.
In February some news about sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and bet him right.
And then, at the end of the year, their earnings exceeded the EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I've won my first 500 million I don't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, "he hasn't left anything for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had misrepresented the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned into a profit
I was afraid you'd come across?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, it would make them happy."
Where did you get so much will to risk that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was among the $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a Fellowship Corridor Assistant, and in 2005 he became a Fellowship Corridor with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I'd never win as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I have chosen only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the chance to achieve 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes there will be approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be destined for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the President of Nicaragua, ordered the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal sentenced 20 years for the president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for a defamation of $100 billion (almost $1.8 billion).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in bounds.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on prison officers if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Alemán set up to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That is how we were approved by the budget
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, as prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote on trust to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view even though the most influential one, has quietly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it conceals the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 it is not possible to resolve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of representatives who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved before last year's elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, have often issued disproportionately disproportionately obligations to their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we follow only the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has passed through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is boasted ČSSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to order the state's finances.
However, instead, the state continued to become indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that, within global measures, we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have been inflated by gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform will not change, then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, government who rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
In exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians that govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the pension tax money and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal expenses of agents' expenses.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who rule to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and taxes, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis in the Finance Market.
The Monetary Mark will receive over $100 billion through tenders.
In these tenders, the banks underlie the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then $224 billion will be facilitated by central banks in Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultant wrote in his report to customers.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still wait for billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay more dearly to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
Central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London's interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This means that banks constantly feared to borrow money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times in the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," he told Reuters, Greg Salvage of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the problem of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Azul, not a green planet, he commented that environmentalist debates are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their diverse opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained to these questions that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't get to change their driving card
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and so they failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials can spend their time up to the end of the year in issuing the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year they will be on the roads hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not changed mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While peoples announce a rapid decline in the exchange of meat, the metropolitan offices are filled with applications and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 daily customers.
In queues is expected half an hour.
In Prague the new card has not yet been taken out about 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new sheep lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their carnet and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid carnet will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infringement with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine may be paid to that person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to pay fines of a thousand crowns at the most.
According to the voice of the transportation ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving card is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driving card.
Simply bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driving card.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty to Berdych's complicit detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided, as a definitive deadline, to reduce penalties for the first to one year and for the second to two years.
Detectives in the department were going to fight organized crime in the first place between 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is expecting first of all the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized participation in the robbery of 19 persons, and today the High Court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s allegations were rejected by the investigation for the purpose of inventing cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without arms permits.
In the home registry, the police found guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the accusation, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring of other processes, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pęt and Maroš Šulej, who have avoided the trial for the time being, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change a few children: 12 million
By changing children in the Maternity House the counsel of the families affected, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers no more than 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal, does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"So much demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty sent us to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a recissor value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň's family wanted, for each month they didn't raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was developed at the Motol School Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by the nurses at the Motherhood House of Třebič last year, on December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed in the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valachia
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute over the Kingdom of Valachia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valachia brand, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka was not present at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka's popularity," said after the trial, Polivka's lawyer.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valachia, the image of the actor and comic comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been working for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of directing him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valachia.
From that comic origin came a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valachia society.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signature in passports and even offered his owners discounts to the visitors of his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"Of course Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valay," the judge said.
He added, however, that Harabiš and his team are in the spirit of the project.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized official coronation in Vsetin for Polivka.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš came to the singer Jarmila Šulaková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which has been rejected by the court until today.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We don't have any hurry.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen on a specific date.
Even Mr Polivka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
I've never really liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its walking characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I'm just thinking about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters long.
Flying around the world
I'm going through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design though already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backups.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi the so-called space shortage in the header disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing about this vehicle is your trunk.
This I must value as very accessible (thanks to the abatable rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, it has a capacity of 428 liters, which compared to competition is more than an average value.
But not compared to the same kind of vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot falls behind its perceptible 52 liters.
From vacation abroad or when placing the child's cot, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains pretty flat after the backups of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a 1.6 l capacity and 88 kW force.
And actually that's how it should look like a 1600 that would look down on the family five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the then škodas that seemed as if the exhaust tube was covered by a cloth, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the adds of the team to the Fabia and it'll get to a quite similar number.
It is now only by which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and for that reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to develop.
Discussions, extortion and tantrums among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after a two-year-old girl attack on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls slapped him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began spitting at us.
When I told him to leave us, he made us the bait of throwing apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," he described another nasty incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools starts to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island is there still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of America's conquest.
Colón called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, with wide avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita they left their signatures the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita fanise you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the dear National Hotel you will be mixed cocktails according to your wishes.
And those 50-year-old cult cars, so far still work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, in particular the ancient neighborhood is deteriorating significantly, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments as there are in the surroundings.
Other places were metamorphosing in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar mills by narrow means in steam or electric machines.
Their cabs for decades have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose models brothers in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just recall that at Hemingway's farm there is a museum that for those who love the writer, they must not stop visiting him.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in soils of limestone rock.
Mogots, pilons of limestone rock and rocks of high escarpados in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco is probably the highest quality in Cuba.
Visiting any of the pure habanera factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone thinks it's interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old Abolego city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became a beauty with constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so distant that in the 1950s there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Ancón Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baraque
A small city in western Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly confirmed by the path itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Columbus cross (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous one, the Yunque.
Café, rum, pure, Sierra Maestra, Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pinos, Cabaret Tropicalna, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, many pages could be filled.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American defence minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population only to start economic and security development," told BBC the defense minister, Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year in 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of which is in the southern part of the territory.
However, for the United States, allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries that have been attending in recent months, the controversy is that all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for liability.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
Sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vaguely.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion kroner in September.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion krona by improving the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased 13.400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its debt data from the early October state.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Throughout last year, the State was indebted with more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the billion crowns border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees this: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, European Investment Bank loans.
Internal indebtedness of the state grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion krones.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated primarily from the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad for the debt to grow but on the other hand it shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a pension reform," Pikorna said.
Better than expected
The state debt and debt management strategy for 2007 was drawn from the government's plan this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion kroner as a result of improved state budget developments.
The amount is mainly made up of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns for the financing of State bonds and 1.8 billion crowns for the payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He compared today before a court to Jartum for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insults to Islam was convicted on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm at 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable for a penalty of whipping.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, has been detained on Sunday in his home and charged with assault on Islam and with sedition, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the director of Robert Boulos School.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of every 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear itself - he had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was just an "innocent mistake " .
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who described it as " very attentive to their students " and " never speaking of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, is written in English in 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, hand it over to a toy?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
No agreement had been reached on Wednesday on the future status of the province during the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, he failed.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, " declared European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake ", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period ", he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated at 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika had been in charge of a new mediation by the UN last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the pursuit of the negotiations beyond this top date.
" Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these "last-opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has been a part of his regret.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a " dominating effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s' wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: on the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in agreement " with the West.
Bush opens an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself met on Tuesday to Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contentious issue between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything he could to help them complete a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties ' obligations to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three major serious problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer in all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things”.
Going back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set the end of its " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States " that co-exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , Prince Saoud believes in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
Just what happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (PGN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 pm, Luisa-Miguel Street, at Villiers-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but on patrol, and was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without rotating beams," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorised to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " all gas " .
"He injured the police car on the left side, after a breach of the ceda the step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholemia on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the outcast front, cracked windshield, torn bumps) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary murder and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, cohabited with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor required that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, rule out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, they confirmed " the police version, namely that this mini-to-cycle came relatively quickly to its left ".
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the scrapping of the soles on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed the time for the police's car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious shortcomings " in this regard.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which one must be very prudent," said one police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely frightened cop, who was limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was speaking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently, to the certainty that the people who were present from the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, relief arrived " about twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not bring assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed for his part.
Tension goes up in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, to the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers carried and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste to which they lent an oath before Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of derogation declared on Saturday afternoon.
It was due in the coming days to speak on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
"All we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgements," the judge declared to The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer appreciates " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy commander of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed a better " fertility domain " , according to the institute which notes that the index of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from the living modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuched" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday, when astronauts had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacement, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in a little bit of a meter by a wire that stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go snail at the end of 30 meters of length of the shuttle's remote arm added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been charged with "operating" the "heated" solar panel.
After inspecting precisely the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second " spacewalker " that had remained close to the air embargo and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-stick of hockey wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuceed" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The sanctioned EADS title in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently coming down clear to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it has to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus ", announced the parent house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any further precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational outcome of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putine, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs the voters a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose contents are kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself to hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite issue during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
He denounces a pressure-absorbing campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such dirty elections, until the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the Garry Kasparov world, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are prohibited visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putine in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term of office.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, to the legislative elections as to the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they do not feel ownership of their destiny " , the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University dates back further: civil society in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic unrest " , Maria Lipman said of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had soon been tested after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will the extremists vote.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54 - year - old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? ”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his rights.
The eleven States in charge of their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
_Sensitivity Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, were opposed to opening up these nominal documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or the mental hangover of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war in a practical way: to find the deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
For a part of the scientific community, however, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische Universität in Berlin, declared in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free change agreement in 2008, said the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The Foreign Ministers of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free-trade pact will do a lot of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " 10 billion euros of services " this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet achieved its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the basic index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an unusual offer of duration.
" To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , states in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 1215 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take further steps to maintain the " interbank lending indices per day in line with its base index.
The interbank rate per day was Wednesday 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with an important penalty index that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties refuse to examine the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist 'niche' (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined by a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, including an increase of 50% of the employment surplus, the re-establishment of the TIPP (inland rate for oil products) floating, a cheque-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles (180 to 115), the meeting was held at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," entrusted Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republican Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead in the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the " most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of the city of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that recently took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours is being held rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", such as that of 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"It must be prudent, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is, however, the promotion of cinema here.
The Oskare race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in a poster at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock market? Experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks to say goodbye to the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, December in stock exchange usually has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties are emerging in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market for the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have rather side behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of Fed types is not known, given the high level of crudeness and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks scored on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Yet not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place each year on these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the United States regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it's about great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the time comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Inversis Bank ensures that the climbs will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low-level month.
The real year-end rally was lived in 2003, in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a rebound of 6.68 per cent.
You will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex increases by 8.36 per cent since January) and if you can count on your year-end rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew most of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the People Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m..
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedule of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of popular experience will be decisive for other entities to focus on this initiative that is a consequence of trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that pursues Popular with the project.
Capture private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches that already have in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring is not a major investment, even if a higher recruitment of staff, since it happens to have about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
The population currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax venues they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the value in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain that led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect affected his joy: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain places its loss on what we have spent in the year at 15.66 per cent.
The value in Stock Exchange of the Mediaset-controlled company (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (five-day editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to turn this year into the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa, the subsidiary managing the group's advertising.
If this announced data became real, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million in the financial year 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile asserts that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and in 2009 by 7%.
They explain that it has cut the projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's forecast of gain by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Box Madrid: See Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintainer) for the 'multiple attractive' and rising business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to override in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best rules in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activity of entities in detail to ensure that markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encourages cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial service signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also expands the number of systems for the implementation of financial instrument operations, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and requires them to keep a record of all operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by CNMV.
In its passage through the Congress's Economy Commission, several amendments were incorporated, among which it highlights that debt securities are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high investor risk, which has been demonstrated by the US high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates can perform in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and the collection of customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices have evolved in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data that is comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to match the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economics, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economics has acknowledged regarding today's advance data.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
The deposits of the Northern Rock have dropped more than 50% to £12 billion (16,800 million) since the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was storing record deposits above £25 billion, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to collect around a quarter of the income from British banks that are deposited over the next three years to achieve those remaining £18 billion until reaching the target of £30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his remarkable advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested mayor of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has today at the first hour of the morning stopped the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption outlined this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Consistory and the Chief of Police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, and according to the sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and the Urbanism Council and no further arrests are dismissed within the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption set up earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Chain, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, therefore out of the room, was stopped leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to qualify for 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy by Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in the press conference by the Secretary of Organisation of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that he has held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
Moreover, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the petty politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress Manuel Marín, who made his decision on 15 November not to present himself to the upcoming general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university field.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry."And make it "more and more look like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and with rest is Congress, the president of the Government on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see him already occupying his position so as not to fall into what he has pointed out his adversaries might see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to merciless persecution both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in the non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred, and why his Government, the government of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with the utmost clarity what measures will be taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will be.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been, and there will be, such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costful, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero electorally that he has rushed to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands, but adorns the myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend to travel by bicycle or cool with the fan.
Arrested the mayor and head of the local Totana police for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel manager for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, where he is currently located with numerous agents, who have also visited the Town Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rural land in urbanizable for the Galicia Nuaria company to build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Totana ' s Judge Number 1.
The first six detainees have been brought to court today.
According to sources, the former director of Totana and today PP's autonomous parliamentary, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former registrar, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman vigis Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Sun of Immonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is conducted by the Civil Guard Central Operational Unit (UCO) Group of Urban Crimes, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would entail the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the viguous parking on Coruña Streets, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica Square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the end of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day on which the criticism of the Blackburn book appeared curiously:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Professor of Education in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

One colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences on Internet discharges:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs for less than 400 euros in the store, it is simply deemed to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the charge for the discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous kidney has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than dropping a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films of the authors is more punished than the distribution of child pornography (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone's going to go hand in hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings that the workers pay monthly depend on what their peers earn.
The study has been carried out by magnetic tomographic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both correct received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly chasing the war criminals of the Balkans since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague for eight years.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla goes with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
His names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006), not premiered in Spain, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to persecute the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What's my point?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the car, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's just that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in return for being held liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the sheep, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer from an accident, the higher the cost to pay.
It is for this reason that both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinetrality due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have reached the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some type of percance.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, it will offer a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 are faced with various disadvantages in hiring an affordable insurance, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the sheep.
Although the ideal for being well insured is insurance at all risk, there are other cheaper options.
Precautionary drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a part of the claim amount.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damages caused to third parties, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid disasters as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a discount on the company's base rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase the bonuses," Noguera clarifies.
After the 25-year-old strip drivers have it easier to hire insurance, as the sinetrality index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a full risk with franchise.
"Of course, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to taking advantage of an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but does not have children yet it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation permits him, of course he is.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest level of sinetrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (possibly EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle’s life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners it is advisable to take any risk insurance with franchise (being 150 euros), or one to a third party extended when a high level of bonus is available.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to study adequately the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point worth the octavos in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the champion's eagle, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to condemn their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to fight the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on the 13th in semifinals looking for a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would stay first and would ensure a better crossing in octavos.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because on equal nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the Scots bitter at night, who are confident to get into eight for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after precisely defeating in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to which only the triumph is worth, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into octaves and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue at the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert on the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people exhausted the entrances to the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowd crowd that overthrew GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our costume, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fifth two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
First, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special aircraft from Virgin Airlines.
Upon his arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
Between five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (US), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rust between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute prior to last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, gas monopolic owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed itself to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine might pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the news agency Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "will have to prove to foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees from outside Europe, said a vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, its report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged bombings in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should have the Guide of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Aran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely implemented.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, stated: "I had a great interest in doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award to the best film.
The trophies also gave themselves to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named better actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And the protagonist of Bond, Daniel Craig won the varietal prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn also won, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree from U2, awarded with two prizes - to the best director and the best debut director.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor was brought by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia leader in London, in the film of David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifties, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, are currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Bead".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who planned an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the largest oil supplier in the world said that one of the cells was planning the missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned the religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda activists target many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," said the spokesman of the interior minister to state television.
Arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus could have once been a suitable place for life, declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin of the Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Physics Department of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of the Earth, when they are two similar planets.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000 sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is unworthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record video questions and send them to be broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon, November 28, were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican Party of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-on-one issue, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas that they would like: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchange of words in the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (by allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the subject.
None has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the toxic toys in China and other concerns about the outside, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble on the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out of the bottom, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but equally emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor do they involve exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, or extramarital finger drops.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour Party, of over 650,000 pounds sterling ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped calling for an election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative burden.
A three-thirds retired generals launched a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably on his way out.
Governments can reach an inflection point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and does not focus.
On one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as a Foreign Minister.
And even though it is not directly involved in Blairish's countertimes - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly cheated.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't make it him.
The laws against anonymity for the great political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved until now: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these performances, even though the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it dissolves in decision-making on a family matter, a committee of inquiry into the matter - led, to a good extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morale is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a party such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins are born excited about.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprimes other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already shown.
There is an increase in both card fees and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Delay and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in fees can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and hence delay) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts are paid to consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed values is fairly strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debt to credit cards now that credit institutions are expired.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the lending capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to benefit the transmitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortising mortgages decrease if properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders may face, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset retaliation.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and credit contraction push America to recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
You have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were tried for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud for collapsing with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of the employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests by zero, but the three British knew it would be valued upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its share of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers paid 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
Three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed business look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former executive chief Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither downstairs nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the Russian rich.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Fier, Gulfstream's representative.
"But no one asks that model of so many seats because it is for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonario Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in a event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract new Russians to all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in mahogany to embroidered diamond car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by the rising oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was at the peak.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for your piece of cake.
Another place in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think think think think.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London Jewellery.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeleled off the design suit that he used as a veteran disching carpet network with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuts, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables on call, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically in a stand of Dutch porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt paint, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the richest Russians of the most historic (10-15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170.000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car grilles in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski colored crystals, so that he resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, won't necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with counterfeit stacks of $1 million.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped rocking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or embroidering a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"Chapúza" surgery could cause a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors below West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly a police patrol car showed up.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test even if the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that is hanging on the top ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house came about 3 P.M.
From November 21 and they found Mrs Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead in the place.
It has been over a week and the authorities have said little about your investigation or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a marchito rosal is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian thief at the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the door of the cab, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
It is expected that the federal reserve will cut the rates to raise the stock exchange
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which were increased with the reassuring comments of the Vice President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The bags were settled in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by improving the market in late September and October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent interest-rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total labour force, in a global reduction of costs to compensate for losses of its investments in the US subprime mortgages.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, at the close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's first-class companies.
The Dax index of Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was above 2.3%.
Before, it was highlighted the recurrence of the tension of credit on the markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, tightened the credit and the rates of the three-month "Libor" loans between the British banks, meant the largest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England Judges Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara Claims
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan - with this particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's office, the director of England, is beginning to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, in one part time.
Whoever does not get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, because trials that always end up subjective are required.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tube" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, they would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the Captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who would certainly play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself to fit and bowls as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class nicknames in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each test and did well in the first ones, with 5 nicknames and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle at the same time who became an important player, and despite scoring a hundred doubles against Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today's session in Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first class opposite only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two shifts in May against West India in the test in Lords, his house as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken some of his "batting" momentum that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He caught up in nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flew his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was get out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say excitedly: "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it is including your swing pass to have effects on your plays that seem to satisfy it, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it's him who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left with no cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus on an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni physician.
"I returned today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary ceasefire.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of its bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's recent arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they have been attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthened groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But many claimed to have returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nouri al-Maliki, Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole of the country, the Sarlandese lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fifth time to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system that in a study by the German Economics Institute (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" held fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three degrees.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from the Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerate.
"The system of vocational education is exploited in Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economics Institute (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. So, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped one third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering science specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether students have increased their performance.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of pupils in school development has fallen from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, the Sarre didn't get much better than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they can achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Currently Chávez is staying like a comic book in Spain.
As reported in the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States in its day imposes the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
Left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be considerably expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was the liberation of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said critical that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
Experts present a great deal of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," said the "Bild" Gustav Horn newspaper of the Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research Institute.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be for employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent as a year passes by, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German Social Democratic Party politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that has not yet been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlpools in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays run from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of California University in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if one day there would be life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface reinstate temperatures of 500°C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolic" twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers' opinion, stress not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more characteristics common to the Earth than we had assumed," the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the South Polar Region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called the star of dawn or the star of evening orbits around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had been packed, which on Earth remained in the oceans, but in Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth had become carbon stones, Venus is the largest part of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Ministry.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democrat Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama reception by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stresses, defending Merkel for the reproach he has received in implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of Una China policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Foreign Ministry caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those occurring in France.
Battles with police in the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot at the police with guns: after severe riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We need to look at our country's social problems not taking the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to sit down the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people were involved in serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded more efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an impersonative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age is above average.
There must be more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"We have to give young people an opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a lighthouse helicopter overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday to Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The performance far away from the Federal Chancellor's reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more needs to be expected from it.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After its desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach he was faced for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clear to everyone that that reproach was appropriate.
You could not feel any minimal interest, or any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
Instead, however, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
An example: the prevention of climate change: much praise was given to himself for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate targets should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years now the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's working on expressions to get people an impulse.
And thus damage your public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's kingdom, internal problems are low-value appearances.
Children's poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All you do is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times you are wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was about more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were confronted in a heated debate of Republican Presidential Pre-candidates on YouTube and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned New York into "a shelter for illegal immigrants."
This one, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "gate" for the illegals." Giuliani answers to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group has no clear favourite, the eight pre-presidential candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by Internet users that were sent to Youtube, don't have much content either.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's reproach for his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown his death.
Public reactions to the St. Petersburg room in Florida show that while the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The audience always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
This way you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains and asks for forgiveness from people and the television audience for being an abortion defender in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when they asked him what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn to be president.
This is the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his army chief's mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the United States.
Eight years after power was done with an unstoppable military coup, the former general for the first time ruled the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the position of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the Attorney General of the state, after the Musharraf oath will cancel the state of emergency very soon and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since he was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there were many lawyers in Musharraf. Last week, the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s followed its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
A copy of "Live 1974" was made as a restornal, which was written in the best time of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the sensation.
Each one of them has before him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band was making music again.
What to rebel about here is this: the precise questions have shown that the band's name retorted in people's minds, but it was not something as special as that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music prize to members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for their work, in the room they could see the surprising faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band The Düsseldorf und Snow!, they all opened their mouths in astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he were an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Rojeelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Rojeelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Song Association Bandarin appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griess. Someone recalls that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Later, Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Rojeelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric themes and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since then has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that's what Groenemeyer needs to do.
His music company Grienland set itself a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Rodeelius, also the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a superband, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the evolution of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where you can see instruments with cables.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of effects devices that they had built with their own hands.
At present electronic music is the same as it had to be.
Three people who dig into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere he coughs, whispers, and at a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but Harmonia now keeps calm.
In the scenario, it reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give one's quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are dedicated again to war in the Balkans.
But the two didn't have much conviction.
Or concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was rediscovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and insignificant roles in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and daring?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the cinema had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decadence preserved so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful movies about war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of them acting very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm was Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was actually never a good film about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about American reporters in the war who are going to detect a criminal war Serb called "zore", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to accomplish something that cannot make the army and each time it turns out to be a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when Simon Hunt is introduced to us at the outset, who are not simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnia who will later kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters could not achieve, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply humane one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles of his front I see, sharing feelings with him, which hard is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or the mines, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short period of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood asks for a good film about the Holocaust with the example of the film "Schindler's List".
Some films need more time. Classics like the war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because screenwriters don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that so bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When he was asked about parallelisms between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that we must be realistic in estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, declared on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term "referred to another time" application.
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympics were not to be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at the ONLINE WELT.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we had so far thought we would have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream didn't last forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to give up the opportunity, if the plans are ruined right now," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate that he made at a reception at the general meeting of the German Public Federation for the Sport of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's 2015 University application not as a "replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Last week alone, the Federation of Sports of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of the time so valuable for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small district of Grassbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social-Democrat Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olimpia planning for the little Grassbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" brightness-boxes on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had doubted the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Modern Museum Museet of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Modern Museum Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "Stocolmo type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that they had soap dust cartons "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum Museet were exposed hundreds of carton-bright boxes. These did not make them Warhol (because of the expenses), but they were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a wood case-bright, but were not exposed in the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which then entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo-type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the private Swedish property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and crushed their tight silvers and then painted them with oil brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990s copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without printing directly the tight plates. Besides, it is not oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museet and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museum Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which it is a case of soap dust.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers had surrendered to a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter who could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been intertwining in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the Thursday trial for having attempted a coup d'état in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly deposit with some 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police officers who were supposed to watch him had moved on to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are sick," Trillanes said.
"We call people to pass our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly led the army of Scout Ringers, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great government critics called Thursday to a major demonstration against the president.
For months his government has received reproaches for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the actions of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an action is EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options for further increasing the financial share of Versatel.
United Internet reported that in this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means that the financial institution maintains the participation securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day took part with almost 10 percent of the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch, in the measure of capital expansion, placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," the spokesperson for United Internet explained.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be content with the participation of ten percent of Freenet and do not use their right, i.e., they are participating to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the Freenet anonymous society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillisch holding directly had 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to make the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
