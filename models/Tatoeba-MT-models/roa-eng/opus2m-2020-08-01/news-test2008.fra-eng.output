Inflation in Europe has spilled over food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than in forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with the growth of raw materials prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of a spiral inflationist.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order not to have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the last 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has gone off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The final market rates for cereals have increased by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the governing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fides supporters (Young Democrats Alliance) has increased significantly since December 2002. So since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Student Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, that is, 13 percent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would represent, because of the greatest determination of the opposition's voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) support against the support of one fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
On the faithful electors, some of whom go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties has increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it stands at 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of the spring and the last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to increase and only one tenth is expected to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous surveys, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent do not trust the President of Fides.
One of the indicators of political change is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of the pollers wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, the rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) felt that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 per cent of the pollers replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additional said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the pollers would surely participate and 15 percent complementary would likely participate. Following current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be without a doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, unlike this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Napi Gazdaság Article (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Standard Daily Christmas Cartel also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly more than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "who had already flown" in the large food stores last December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, however the prices of turkey nets, nuts and peacocks have greatly increased.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle with two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle with which it was delivered.
It only prevented this year, in terms of Daily Shopping, Auchan was the most expensive and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the daily basket price by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket with last year's least expensive basket, we see a difference of 12 percent while the difference between last year's least expensive and most expensive year's basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine how much to apply on products so long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so much that the most expensive basket was higher than 1,720 forints than the 2006 price, while the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than the value of 1,630 furnaces last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 furnaces as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic necessities, the Institute of Statistics has seen an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the product, this seems almost absurd because the price level of the product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers hold a higher position than egg suppliers because they have successfully accepted the brutal price increase also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, most customers no longer look at prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-conservation food with pallets.
On Wednesday morning, major tails formed at the boxes of the three hypermarkets, as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies not even achieving the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Recently, MRSA was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a man hospitalized for a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he returned to the hospital due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogenic agent were reported to the National System of Nosocomial Surveillance, Karolina Böröcz, Chief Physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, said.
It is known that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e., by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
One third of the people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, trauma infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate way, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in bad hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the head physician at János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital life.
Above all, we must not confuse infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one or not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
As this infection is particularly evident in hospitals and elderly residences, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The implementation of microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spread from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, to wear gloves and protective masks. However, significant gaps are detected in hospitals in this area as well.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by droplets inhalation and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of the epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is exorbitant spending on social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official finding of the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd district was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to a state of drunkenness or dizziness, reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd district Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(The fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian pass does not constitute an mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for retirement because, according to the police communication, he was greatly disturbed by the accident.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Investigations Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for carrying out the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest with a total value of €400 million on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties, this time the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later as a result of the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would review the possible modification of the original contract when Hungary completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on this country of the Balkans, which is hardly mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys in this EU market that is always the least expensive but who will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Today, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Gold Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also raise the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the areas of trade and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best route to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
Analysts say that people who buy a building in Bulgaria seek at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. At the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old run-down houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general the local doctor's.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since last December Bulgaria is listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a value plus in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is increasing steadily as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21% each year.
The increase in real estate prices largely exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Waters, professional meetings end Tuesday, but Wednesday, after the official opening, the Ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is expected to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, serious discussions are under way between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss accurate figures, although they were ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, apart from reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors composed of 16 members probably under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing by 2020 its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the "After-2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had totaled a 5.2 per cent reduction and all 15 EU members at that time made an 8 per cent reduction commitment.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release by the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is large in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, which was stressed in the new IPCC report, an international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who became passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londres or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is indispensable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and reports videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial aim of the air force, the videos were transferred to the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make public the real objectives of the military presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing in relation to the usual recruitment ads on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message because it makes a special justification for the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is outraged because, apart from the videos composed and carefully censored, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site, which also present the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been involved in loading these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently using the American's Army shooting game for free download. In this game the player can put himself directly to the place of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Beignettes in the Ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say good-bye to 2007 by taking beignettes and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will delight the public servants with a Tomb and offer a drink to create an atmosphere of Christmas.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so the power is fun.
The public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the department employees who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this celebration, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas festival which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a tendering company.
The building of the Gaîte Theatre was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to contact the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball was worth five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcoming words and dinner was followed by a live music dancing evening.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening was not at all mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party to its employees in its walls for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat beignets, the press, the party will not cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his collaborators to drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Regional Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected to attend.
It will spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No expected holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the feast held in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas Day will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Forest, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not celebrate Christmas at all, provided the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the event organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega strike forces gather together
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form, Friday, their strike commission which will be responsible for coordinating the strike on Monday indeterminate terms.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic stops as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions of the League will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be set up and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they do not reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote to the Parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on what to do.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, voting on the law on health funds is likely to take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike planned for Monday, major stoppages are planned in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of trade unions is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report making the strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary work stop.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) have not been able to find agreement on minimum services, and more and more of them are taking the train as Christmas holidays approach.
According to current communications, Budapest's public transport will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union called for strikes for 2h and 2am to 8am, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in the case of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be carried out in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League's Unions, the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal for secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Mozgalom Movement for Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society notes that, in connection with the work of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the increasing ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Typsian population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy for possibly causing this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with the effect of increased attention from Hungarian and international media, the work of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, that is, the state," they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method that, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The focus on civility and association status is therefore only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in the court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the Hungarian Guard's activity is also a factor that increases the risk to neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard Constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the Research Institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roms disorders that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian guard's constitution.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to provide custody by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations concerning the formation of their own resistance guards indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national and state holidays as well as the days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the alarm clockers can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15th is a national festival, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as on October 23, which is also the commemorative day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the celebration of work and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember members of our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or there is only one working day before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the extended weekend price by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and employees employed, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that run uninterrupted and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life ends almost all over the country because according to experiences most people do rather overtime or take vacations they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week next year, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work holiday to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will pause non-stop even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six Folly Things That Can Terriblely Embrace Fellows
We forget to send e-mails, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that bother us almost more: these are things that "pretend" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these problems or respond to the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," a colleague told you.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, things are arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to pick up a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the other day you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry at you about having hurt their property.
It doesn't bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more and that you need it right away.
Do you have privacy with your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop pots that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Do not tell everyone your information (subjections) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Keep the information shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You declare yourself ill without just reason?
When you call the office and you report sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Colding, scissors, telephone
You're getting into your work, but you're getting your colleagues off the hook?
You've become, unwanted, witness to a phone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with coldness, cantonation, loud talk (which you carry over their heads), foot beats, big words or discontent expressed in loud voices.
They may bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the time limit, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone of forgetting it!
Don't put it on the account of potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize him if you have made a mistake and if it has presented inconveniences for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix your neglect!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit at the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Do not neglect, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function demands it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
Slowly advance into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm going on sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr.2 broadcasted the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now, now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new mode of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he went on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was given the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 quoted their first 2002 album among the fifty most important albums in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become "tendy" but no one has asked them if they want to wear this label.
The group reacted as needed, it came out a new and better disc.
The recently released Cannot Walk Fly Instead album can open new tracks for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Balázs Zságer Fish.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for radio, mr2 Petõfi, having been spreading popular music recently from morning to evening, began to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right then (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternatives music, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception also operates in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and the foreign public, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only young people in their early 20s but also older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am of course glad to see more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the unsatisfying changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made a career more west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let us deploy.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because there are many of us leaving his group and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On the palm of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you opened consciously towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube in order to sell the disc.
That song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choral of the kind gospel.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodossi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else missing in this song.
The follow-up of agreements drew the song's voice.
I even sang the song the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for one brief solo by Judy Jay), they do not have a role alone, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than music, so music does not just accompany their singing.
They were back on the stage as well.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song did you do the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with concerts and because I've already "dropped" this disc.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is risking billions because of its inferiority complex
A concealer fraud.
Thus the former employee of the French giant is designated the Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost almost EUR 5 billion because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he in time recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they told his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, in view of Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or to those who had encountered past repayment difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he put it right.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Once I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that, of course, he didn't keep anything for himself."
In all the questioning, he admits that he has failed the reports so as not to be deleted.
He succeeded in doubling his superiors, although the Eurex scholarship began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who is in danger of nothing
Was he crignating to be discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where's your willingness to risk so much?
He only gradually reached his post.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trading assistant, and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university degree and my professional and personal career," he told investigators Kerviel.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half-billion euros by focusing on the decline in this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
"There was like a snowball effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
Now, that's when the start of the year comes.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to conceal the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic has an opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes will be destined for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport program is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain through these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage an amount of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the less successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
However, later he was released and lived as a resident in his hacienda near Nicaragua's capital.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on 1997-2002, will or will not be incarcerated again, it is not clear for the time being, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on the prison officers, or they will let Germany finish his sentence at his home, or he will go back to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German was moving the government's money on a regular basis to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious societies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
How exceptional is this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was one year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the debate before the vote on the declaration of defiance to the government this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
That's kind of a paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article constitutes the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more media-attractive and that is why he is given more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more of an interest in opinion than in abstract figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of resolving at the same time:
The first being the significant share of the statutory mandate costs, which consisted not only of pensions, but also of social burdens, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that is the largest.
The latter is public and relatively controlled.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, too often, in order to obtain, apart from tax, tax and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts by the massive sale of the shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is noted that:
Our economy has been going through for many years, as has the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD has been selling it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they owed the State more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that largely falls back on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, precisely in recent years, been unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditure, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated if a break in the retirement age limit, and a reform of the pension system will not take place in the near future, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
In exaggeration, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs rejected by mandate costs.
The projected 70 billion deficit for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we do not really want to see policies in power become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to take in tax and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will progressively achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to jointly address the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl's report to customers from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be followed," said the leading economist of the ADN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would decrease consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession that could affect the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to lower the interbank rate of Londres, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the Central American, Canadian and English Banks had decreased their interest rates several times in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will contribute to the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time focused on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a combination of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction at what his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now, interested people can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt he had sufficient provisions to draw up such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, he said, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in the book are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained several times that it was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an inclusive environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the time limit to expire and have failed to renew their former driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driver's license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for delivery within a short five-day period.
In this case, the driver pays an extra of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not succeed in carrying out the compulsory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid driver's license will be subject to a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also treat the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall rise to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, a fine was likely even to be imposed by a person who was not going to circulate.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they wish to have.
It is not like with the identity card that it must be valid without exception.
People who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old for renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties of detectives made with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conniving with the gang of David Berdych, will be held 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The High Court of Prague sentenced them permanently by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department of Organized Crime Detectives had a prison sentence of 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, but only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is not waiting for the verdict of first instance for the moment.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, which exceed 16 years of imprisonment.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty of participation in holding-up 19 persons, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeal interviews of 16 of them.
Most of the accused had, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang paid 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the case of the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, most of which victims have suffered a serious health injury, but also abuse of the power of a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police have discovered illegally detained guns, shells with a steel core, a visor for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already convicted of other hand-lifted flights Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has, for the moment, avoided Tomáš PŠta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The Price of Child Replacement: 12 million
The lawyer for Igor Veleba families wants to get compensation from the Třebíč hospital of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That's why hospital attorney Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned the drafting.
We're going to check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
The amount is expected to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million crowns each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been confronted with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and precisely what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over to each of the families 100,000 krona for reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are subject to civil liability insurance by law.
In the event of a failure, they must rely on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
So far the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were about hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute about the Valašské království brand (Kalašsko Kingdom).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, he had actually used the title of King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasiting about Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko refer to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There is almost ten years of work behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasite on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polivka who used the title valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this was not related to the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making passports of Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally resulted in a profitable business and commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that its name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered pay holders on the price of the visit of its farm and theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has only used the bare idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž broadcast, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team that devoted itself to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetin.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šulaková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today refused.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and one half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the king's parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polivka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
His qualities of bearing were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
However, there is currently its successor, Peugeot 207, which is much better on the market.
Even more so as the SW called combi goes one more step further, I just have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatback of the Peugeot 207 I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the seats behind.
As long as the complaints are over, because the combined bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's see it soon.
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I won't repeat myself.
It's a very successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or too short records is turned up.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body dimensions is also sensitive here.
The combi also sees the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A safe in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy fixture.
Blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not overwhelming and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, this is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to point out the benefits, I would mention the underside of the box left after the reverse of the back seats perfectly straight, or a very low footpath.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like, that makes a family hatback work.
It is silent, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having an escape jar blocked by a napkin, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipeouts, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add extra equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's nothing left to choose from.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is a challenge
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among those who remain concerned about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the opposing conflicts of Slovak origin and immigrants are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights between the students have become part of the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to respond to the attack on a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
The girls allegedly sent this man racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then he discovered his butts," described another unpleasant adventure by a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people went to qualify for conflicts with immigrants in the struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect of your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or an environtant cocktail.
The kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriches.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American Mafia, built it, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and the fiats previously imported have long, in such a salty and wet climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there is precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
For the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, but also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in sugars on a narrow path by small steam trains and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives are being set up where contemporary people are not only in museums.
Where to take his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in chandeliers from the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile land being caught in their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and of sugar that has brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has embodied in the beauty and character of this small city-town.
Koloniální španělská architecture, výrazně ovlivněná poudějšími francuzskými osadníky, if za čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Escambray mountain, is a place so far apart that in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road connecting this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, each one was just having a roof over his head.
If we have more time in Trinidad than a afternoon, then it is worth seeing also interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which is animated after sunset and where the music is only drowsy in the early morning.
Baraque
Some refer to this village located in the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has included the Eastern Ecueil de Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
We make the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the Colomb periple) and from the hill where the old castle stands and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, Truies Bay and Pinos Island, Tropicalana Cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by descendants of former slaves, about all this could be filled with pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan was not as expected, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country were agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called through Defence Minister Robert Gates NATO troops to greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development assistance.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but the military power can only form part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," the British Minister of Defence Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will need to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has made similar comments today.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 80 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would take three days.
Who is passive
The last few months also have been among the countries involved in conflict on the issue if all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as lazy this week.
"Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while our people fight," Sun wrote in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by posting a picture of a British crew during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The State's debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding 84,000 kroner shall be borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion krona at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of changes in government budget savings, the Department has reduced the amount planned to $152.8 billion.
The State of the Czech Republic's debt rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion krona.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion krona.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion krona.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is borne by each Czech.
Throughout last year, the state has indebted itself to more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a lower deficit planned for next year, one could cross the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is caused primarily by the accumulation of the deficits of the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by securities, securities, direct borrowings or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion krona.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion krona and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion krona.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rent titles where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is wrong for debt to grow, but on the other hand, it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when retirement reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than we expected
As a result, the state debt and financing strategy for 2007 was planned by the government to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, as a result of a better than anticipated state budget economy, the Department reduced the amount planned to $152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which clearly amounts to 76 billion kroons this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroon originally planned.
These are then the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion krona, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state-owned securities for 43 billion krona and the repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion krona.
Today she was appearing before a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insults to Islam was sentenced by a Khartoum court on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of letting 6-7-year-olds give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is wrong.
She was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Khartoum Unit in Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with touching Islam and seditating, pursuant to section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the principal of the Robert Boulos School.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in the Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was just an "innocent mistake".
Notice shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talk about religion in class".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most well-known name in Britain, he writes of English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this last name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without having been able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect immediate violence, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, "that there are obvious tensions."
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated at 90% of Albanian phones could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo from the Security Council, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's administration, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said it was ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council did not vote in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovare Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade's autonomy plan "was in a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade says that it has a "domino effect" in an area still fragile by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should be brought back exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: on the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian-speaking people would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities," said Bush, recalling both parties to their obligations under the "road map" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and address all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged that the forthcoming talks should be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort should be made to loop them in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set the time limit for implementing his co-existing "two-State vision" of Palestinian and Israeli States.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to that effect as Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was the source of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is attacking the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saoud in his interview with the Saudi-capital Arab-speaking daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each of these types of facts, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (ICPN) survey, a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green bike of the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "to very bright".
"She ran the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," says a police officer.
The control of alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before defuse, star windshield, bumper bumper) reflects the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons in danger" to the IGPN, cosisisia with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IPPN investigation, at this stage, was not responsible for the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained sealed as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which police officers would have left the premises very quickly, thus giving no help to the two young people.
While remaining cautious, the ICPN would also avoid "any serious fault" on this point.
"This is one of the most difficult aspects of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which we must be very cautious," said a police source.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows, exactly on the stage.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to hurt them, says this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a fully hajarded policeman, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was speaking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and apparently, with the certainty that the people who were present with the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
Still according to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police."
They also practiced cardiac massages in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension goes up in Pakistan
Pakistan's police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear grenades used by the law enforcement authorities, according to witnesses.
They were fired by stone jets, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were interrogated.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly interrogated.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president '' has urged the people to send flowers to judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and those who have sworn oath before Musharraf''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly subject to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was due in the coming days to decide on the legality of the re-election to the Presidential on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was drafted and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings''' said the magistrate to The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president ''is no longer holding'' after the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unintended
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
At the same time, the liberalization of contraception has allowed a better "fecundity control" according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for a couple out of five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a sun panel torn, essential to the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricked" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday while astronauts had unloaded from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical part to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of catchment dock for the modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel generation module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged about a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally due to perform a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to caracol at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very appropriate, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician was responsible for "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fault cable and installed "tights" types on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" staying close to his and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-cane of insulating hockey to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The sanctioned EADS title in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling significantly to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of his military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to ''EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus''', announced the parent house of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when submitting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the polling station: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of Russia's united list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left nothing clear when receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, most transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the count.
She denounces a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been such dirty elections, even in Eltsine's time.
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the Soviet Homo"
Behind these unsustainable legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the president's first round on 2 March 2008; the candidates had until 23 December to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to hold a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putine play after March?
Prime Minister?
The leader of the parliamentary majority and the powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislatures and the president, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes on to say: civil society has delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putine has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "give up their personal responsibility willingly" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia together.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of what the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by 54 - year - old Tamara Tcherednitchenko: “What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, upon request of a former victim or his entitled persons.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed and has been in effect since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, have opposed the opening of such nominal documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to prove their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Again in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Fr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Antisemitism Research Centre at the University Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light to the European Commission in April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A huge free trade pact between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet "reached its potential". The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a bid of ten billion pounds at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that BoE is placing five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans to day-to-day with its basic rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was Wednesday 5,829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by an important penalty rate which had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book price over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the money placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was part of a socialist "little" (under the initiative of a parliamentary group), declined by about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or the management of rents.
Having voted against the discussion of Articles (180 to 115), the sitting was adjourned following the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes strong, between a majority and opposition a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took over the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and later, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked assiduously with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," Charlie Jones said.
"We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are getting ready to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after appearing in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a European and urban farm festival to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people from the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been made to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promotion Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays in Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" legs?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best," he says.
The festival race
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals on the West Coast, whether it be that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock exchange? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands while waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not as certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock exchange is generally positive.
However, forecasts should not be made solely based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term " .
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange to take momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds through the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this reason, they believe that the grant will have rather side-effectal behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur each year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a bit different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).
Analysts do not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Investis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back to him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Investis Banco ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers can also benefit from this rally, in case they go there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," said the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a month's share.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock market emerged from the crisis caused by the growth of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds in computerizing its year-end rally.
The People ' s Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 8:30 p.m..
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to adhere to or not to this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
To attract self-employed customers in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street businesses chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the time amplification is accompanied by a different design of the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have room for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets to be selected, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently owns 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero says.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: 'what hurts me, it's not the fact that we have increased but that we have lowered less,' he said.
However, he stressed that on a low market, 'we have less fallen'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival, Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies in the Stock Exchange amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary who manages the group's advertising.
For this to be true, the television channel is expected to record for the current fiscal year a 3.6% increase in its billing for advertising compared to the 965.4 million in the fiscal year 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Stock Exchange is the important out payment it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise to give a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
The company Ibersecurities recommends that both values be purchased based primarily on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antenna 3 (maintain) for the multiple attractions ' and the increase in business.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends to examine both cases since it has had ' similar threats' (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year's end.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activity of organizations in detail so that markets operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, implies the modernization of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultation services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for carrying out operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order systems to the regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service undertakings to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and obliges them to keep a register of all operations they carry out, to facilitate the control of the NCMV.
In passing through the Congress's Economy Commission, several amendments were added, one of which highlights that the debt held will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which proved to be with the US high-risk (subprime) mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management has benefited in order to legally delimit the functions that graduates in the Economy may have 30 years after 1977 was approved, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the NCMV and who will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering comparable data over time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available for publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed next December 14.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Minister of the Economy, Pedro Solbes, stated that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the Congress halls that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to today's announcement.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 million (16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, he had a few record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government had offered and that it would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British banks' revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these remaining 18 billion pounds until reaching the target of the 30,000 million.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the highway.
Mayor Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard today stopped in early morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the Chief of Police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's me Juan Morales, the current right-wing Member, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'lesser' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SERR Chain to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession of the plot.
Furthermore, according to the sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged cash flow of Morales' commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galicia construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight persons detained.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who released on November 15th his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his political career to engage in the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or cry" and make "it more and more look like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his ability to do" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change undergoes without mercy both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a movement leader who is the president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even plans to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors has occurred and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to do, what economic consequences will it cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening to account for businesses and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist party seemed to him so deliberately dangerous in Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, adorns the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we are going to travel on bicycles or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hotel, where he met at the moment many agents, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Council of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of Sol Industriel and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanise them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructed.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial position.
According to sources, Totana's previous municipal councillor and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is conducted by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So a single person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodation, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo in the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment yesterday published in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared there, curiously, the critic of the Blackburn book:
"The content of the course of Philosophy has questioned public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the lycées."

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable from six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store of less than EUR 400 is considered to be a fault only (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the penalty imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out with magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed".
Researchers observed that when both people came to receive the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion would require so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the war criminals of the Balkans since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
Her term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the chief officials of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at liberty.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ' Carla' (2006), not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss Prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who continues the fugitives and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence seniority, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it's just that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is made by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and, in exchange, becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence seniority, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or used, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely an accident is to occur, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of disasters than their own caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver needs to study the situation to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when entering into an affordable insurance contract, as can be the low experience in driving and driving licence seniority.
Although the ideal for being well-insured is risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for insurance for any risk with frankness, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the claim that the client pays will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, Spain's head of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid disasters as far as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will allow itself to increase the bonuses," explained Noguera.
After 25 years this becomes easier for drivers when entering into a contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose insurance at all risks with frankness.
"Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has not yet children, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk, as his economic situation permits him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of claims, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance at all costs (possibly EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured person has a high level of subsidy.
"They have a more relaxed drive and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk insurance at all costs is preferable (is EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents a major expense, that is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that is most appropriate to us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be first and Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass to him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero game at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would stay first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to qualify if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game goes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope to qualify for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth finals in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attending the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Vancouver that the group meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the group was told that it was angry at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes its main successes as well as two new songs, 'headlines' and ' Voodoo', published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were on stage showing the bracelets that the 'Posh Spice' husband had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice' which was part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special aircraft from Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, a babysitting army was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is sending the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas fermented between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had resulted in a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, the Russian-owned monopoly company providing gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve Ukraine, a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas flows," said Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinkh at Reuters Press Agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of gasprom supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in an increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Health of Scotland must improve the controls to be performed on its extra-Community employees to verify that they have previous criminal records, said the Monitoring Committee.
Rev. General Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas persons employed by the Ministry of Health.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The General Reviewer carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin serving the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permit for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosion to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Reviewer General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Previous Criminal Control Office, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been verified well, it is not done every time."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he would do himself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas personnel is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that the pre-employment controls currently carried out, function well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported that 1161 overseas people were employed by most doctors and nurses.
But the General Reviewer stressed that these figures must certainly be reviewed on the increase, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate duration contracts, which may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for controls by health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its pre-employment policy and control system for non- ocean staff in the health service.
Secretary to Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic about doing this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland allied to the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.

Winston said he was proud to receive this prize named after star Harris, star star in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admirable in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored"

Saudi Arabia Block 208 terrifying plots
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells in an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the missile smuggling cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have conspired with the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government asked the churchmen to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Allied Shiite Government in the United States, considered heretical according to the Saudi Sunny's hard line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by the appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five... months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 Medine members organized into a "media cell" to promote "Takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
The data from the European orbiting ship showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is water- deprived, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "we begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario where billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, may even be with a living area."
From enriched uranium seized by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons have been arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
It did not confirm that it was a good uranium, but it revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn't able to stand up as a candidate for the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who recorded their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions were as ridiculous as that of another debate on You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected much on the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the upcoming elections.
It is not known which criteria the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-on-one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear funny things: The government noted increases in approval when candidates expressed themselves in a gross manner.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr Romney, who took the lead in the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York City.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
Both combatants became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering clandestine status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
None of them have the chance to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears towards the external world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other topics have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, in the contents of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - put in position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The rise of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with recent prodigious research of grants by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during the Wednesday debate.
These two emerged from the neon, due to the fact that the two protected parties did not come to agree to decide who was the most well-known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the early and convincing party with a message of success on American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to darken; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices from politicians, no extra spooky marital toes.
But this is a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown had well fought.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his draft election, insultingly the British intelligence proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, showed a fault in the guidelines and a poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, a Protestant against reductions in military spending: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of mad donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going unrelentingly towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and with no more goals.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, as unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to reject Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party "money counting for members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she seems to be.
The gaffs are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories Party make them believe it.
As in Mr Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize the Stalinist tendencies of the old Mr Brown, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not wish any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big policy granters are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using an inquiry committee on this matter made up of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Public Standards of Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financial affairs of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan Mr Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreprehensible integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see sharp fins, whirl around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the shares of the unrecoverable balance sheet, or which are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card carriers.
It's too early to panic.
Insolvency and costs are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005 on personal bankrupts caused a sudden fall in bankruptcy archives, which, in turn, caused serious losses on credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers are required to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is fairly strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 issue volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of the heritage, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently, debt by credit card would become a priority to restore the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions because they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all loans," said Capital One Director Gary Perlin.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were expected to testify to fraud committed by the previous Financial Director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first found themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged fraud collusion in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should be brought before the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous all over Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a matter still outstanding for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation in the Enron Dam.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "Third of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him cheat on the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in the bankway in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its slum speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion market value loss and more than $2 billion pension plan loss.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
No sub, no outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Fier, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Fier was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Fair, an orgy of consumption incentives, for four days, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from yachts in acjou to cars filled with diamonds such as 50 Cent.
Mr. Fier was scrutinising a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"With a boom in oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Such the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the world's largest spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Grupo Bijoutier de Soho.
"All women are well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the fair, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare themselves to be their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high seasuit dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to line up in the caps to come up to a huge warehouse where the Cadillac Escalades are exposed, platinum mugs, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand-made.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10-15 years are too much in accordance with Russian standards) have already passed shining logos to some sort of limited-edition mark that could not sell to the salon.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires or tourists, stop the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 moto, a company that equips cars with last-cri alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the shiny orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted her to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ointment leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
It will certainly keep it in its garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"there's more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires may at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Show.
Passers arrested to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this fake wealth or even for a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everybody can feel millionaire," said Karyev.
Surgeon unapproved murder suspect in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window bay of Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then there comes the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, who the police have not yet identified, resides at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for confidence, the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has attracted the top ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two 14-11-year-old sons and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived at her place around 3 p.m.
and found Melle arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand if part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Melle Castro's house where a sparkled rose was lying in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian aboyat to the rear.
A blue bottle called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a vanilla substitute in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the underfloor.
Two bicycles all land hanged on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo was extremely valuable, assisting her in sailing into the new city and abandoning her framed political culture.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease rates related to the effervescence of the global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the terms of the credit, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the Vice President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2, after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly "reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this harsh turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a later rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the largest fall in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial tumult has been increased following the statement by Bear Stearns, Investment Bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the loss of loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55% reaching 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% ending at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of market credit difficulties has been highlighted as a result of the high demand for a monthly auction of tri-funds from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions, led to the rise in monthly tri-lending rates "Libor" by British banks, leading to their highest growth since September, to 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Selection Officers who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris' office, the President General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
The one who won't win the No. 6 back will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to erase what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the bottom level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is that just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tube"?; both new managers who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the Captain's eye, at the same time it must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was speaking in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's going to be playing the Asgiriya stadium, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could erase or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricket of the test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia could still be under estimate.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the 88th Test in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at age 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah only made ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his momentum so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently fell on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only deferred slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (subsponsor of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its filamental allure allows him to perform services that go to him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this perhaps the true art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara a chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be the one who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city will regain normality.
Some have returned to fight militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I went home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the church militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to stay away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aid militia allowed him to drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have attracted the growing calm of the capital since the arrival of the American troops, and in view of the continuing training of "groups of citizens involved" well armed and working with the US military to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all regarding visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit its efforts to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of sectarian squadrons of death.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden stream of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated State leads to vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derition, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the formation system of the Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economy of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five students get their degree in a professional school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparisons tests in the entire federated state.
For children to begin early learning, the last year of daycare is free of law - a model that in the meantime of other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
Bavarians are better off.
And in spite of the rice, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise points could be gained in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the sapphires are not French.
Set the clock to zero
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring back the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez became a cartoon in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, as a result of a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The nationalist on the left announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it just because of my dignity," Chávez said, "who looks forward to constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "knapped to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chavez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ring rages in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you talk about it) is the phrase that already over half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was spoken by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interrogations of the left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
Lower wages threaten Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong juncture, according to one forecast, a real lower-value wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their pay sheet in 2007 compared with the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low wage growth, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Research on the Environment, in the journal "Bild".
New charges could also be involved in unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credit or financial assistance, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere in life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind turbines at poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today brought evidence of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been on a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed to be in the first place.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a cloud turbine at the south pole, which is even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Physica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star at night or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 days in the ground.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth in carbonate form, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the dispute of the parties with regard to the reception of the Dalai Lama to Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs due to attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and the great coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," said Köhler at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler demonstrated understanding for the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, emphasized the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of just one China.
"China knows that too," said Köhler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the CDU's ranks.
Steinmeier had complained, in particular, about the CDU's "policy for the advancement" of foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception to Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only ordered the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel's information, frozen the so-called foreign ministers' strategy dialogue.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires the German chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai-Lama welcome was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, supported Wen Jiabao thus the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the Minister of the German Interior has demanded.
The German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not also constitute a social explosive at home and is demolished in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said in the "New Press" published in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"As regards the integration summits to the Islam conferences, this is already showing its first success."
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
More efforts to integrate the German government were needed by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stressed that the proportion of unemployed people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training places should be provided first and foremost.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families was taking place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be cautious."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian Faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities have reported three arrests as well as a few burnt cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit from the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disturbances overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor's utopian entrance shows that the coalition ended with the background - and there's nothing to wait for from it.
In which country does this chancellor live justly?
After his disheartening speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, at the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptive sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed by that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all the extent to which this reproach was correct.
There was no real interest or lack of feeling for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a heavy-duty politician, who fled into foreign politics and who even remained in the nearby area.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes and still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even, self-sacrifice - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it two years ago.
Now she's stuck to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
It thus destroys its image of pragmatist, which solves the problems rather than beautify the world.
But in the cloud of Angela, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He's got a few auxiliary phrases left for that.
In this regard, the number of times in which it is spending on family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a specific sentence in half.
She was in the unknown field, from the moment it became concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican candidates to the president, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of candidates is already on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestines", blame Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against his side by heavy reproach: "I would say that his own house was a haven for clandestines" Giuliani answers and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are attacking: as the Republican base also does not have official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films Internet users sent via Youtube are just more than blowers.
"It is with this sort of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power," launches John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taught vigorously by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the nucleus is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause is delayed in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie once again.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said and presented his excuses to the base and to the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilians.
One day after his withdrawal as Chief of the Armed Forces, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military rule is over.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistan's television broadcast live the ceremony to the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday he had handed over his duties as chief of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus folded to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
With this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on November 3.
Shortly after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers return.
Germany's supergroups of the 1970's are re-enacting: the three members of the Harmonia Group once again took their consoles in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were published.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the middle in a white shirt as snow.
It is flanked on the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother and has a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertent to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has assured some emo among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to unveil it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is based on the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as long as it is sustainable for this group to be also painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why would not the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
More and more, what is falsely called "Krautrock" has become even more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the German pop faces interrogators were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that was felt was much lower than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Rojeelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
After Düsseldorf, for a church-funded label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly gone into Kraftwerk and finally made himself a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Rojeelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
So-called in the trash was a fan of the Horal Harmony Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many hold Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also serene and modest that sounded music, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griess in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone thinks they remember.
At that time, Rother expressed the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Rojeelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster revives itself in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the album "Live de Griessesem" to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been arrested on this occasion as the personal work of Rojelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, in the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence appears in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The screenings of other black and white pictures of bazaar wired tools are used for the formation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments of the inauspicious sounds through the instruments with effects built by themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them are big technical financiers.
Even the choir of the house will change nothing.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the sound cloud, and sings at a beautiful "Aaaaaaaah" moment with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It never meant rock.
Roots have been less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to irritate by that now.
But what goes the most of itself will be carefully covered on the scene.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Death Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Whether projects rely too much on action and foolish fire exchanges or on the contrary, they are too grumpy.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but this is precisely where, in the most murky country of the war in Bosnia, actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had in the last place lost the most beautiful man in the nineties, because too many gentle and futile roles in movies with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of eye-clins: at the bottom, his character as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this strength, "The Hunting Party" continues together with German production "Death Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of missed films on the Balkan War.
The trial can be made quickly by "murdering peace": the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two is soon falling in love.
Although it is welcome that Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of foolish shootings.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a good film on the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two men go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military can't do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters did not succeed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt fairly intensively because of secret political agreements.
But good intentions and evil are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the swollen forehead, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that imply how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films on South Africa yet.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a field of mines, it comes out then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood can shoot a good movie on the Holocaust with Schindler's list.
Some films still need to mature - those that today are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today just too much about the world's conflicts, where every hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it's a pleasure for writers to miss the scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" has actually become so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we don't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects the critique for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has been a political and economic challenge to virulent criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The Chief Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new point of departure in the longer term, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It was not Hamburg who decided to apply for the Olympic Games, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, about Munich's 2018 Winter Games candidacy.
This preference means for us, that, in the time span we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have called Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 universities as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Sports Colleges had first been appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor's SPD was accused in the Senate of not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for a plan integrated into the Olympiads and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidacy would have raised in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg had, however, broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' cashiers.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's works list.
A large part of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal searches of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today lead to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is encapsulated, a decoying chain of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of boxes made of cardboard Brillo: These were not from Warhol's (for financial reasons) but had been delivered directly from the Brillo card factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates which at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol had subsequently surrendered to him.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
On that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, including two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and laid, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the paint was applied directly without background on laminated panels, using a painting roll - and it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic painting.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has of course announced that it would investigate the "loud accusations" that will be raised in the case of soapboxes in powder.
But since we've been standing there with an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers quit, the same ones who had broken out in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had recently attacked the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been torn apart for hours in the building.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to eclipse suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Hotel Peninsula and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops to power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had led prior to the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly.
The critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by the complaints of corruption.
Since 2003, the finance district of Manila has been the theatre of the mutiny attempt of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke down about 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven putsch attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured a participation of more than 20 per cent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14,46, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, we tell it on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 per cent of its participation in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in stock exchanges.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies have founded the company with MSP participation in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and do not make use of their 18.49 percent additional right to endow at Freenet, entrusted United Internet Thursday.
However, the two companies would be left open to all options, particularly to increase participation in SA Freenet, we have learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still hardly predictable on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers related to a mobile telephone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch have so far had a direct share of 6.01 percent in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent additional.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
