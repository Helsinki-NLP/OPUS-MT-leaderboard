The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, early Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell to approximately 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
This also expresses the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives which refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Drop of shares in Asia
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated part of the losses.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index of Hong Kong during its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movements of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares of the Sidney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Secretary of the Index dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the US are insecure and this influences the financial market all over the world," said Hong Kong's Chief of the Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without reliance on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat of falling will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the aid plan for the financial system to which $700 billion should be devoted (almost $12 billion).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American shares lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the shares collected the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress Retired: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American finance system.
Your vote will be taken at the beginning of next week.
American legislators caused a gap in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and vote.
The aid plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and of the Assembly Bank on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made a great deal of progress.
We resolve our differing views on the way in which the package of measures for the stabilization of the market should be taken," said Democrat Nancy Pelosia to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definite form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a direct impact on the fast-track stock market.
According to the Senator-Democrat for Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing their best to ensure that Congress finally approves an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in the Asian finance market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when they will vote on the two chambers of the American Congress and, even if they won't stand at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but the Congress may overcome its veto by a majority vote.
In spite of these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained that consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchasing of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and values "the commitment of both sides to stabilise our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of armored contract
The president of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the program money for protecting taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a mitigating closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This one should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of payments to the debtors' deadlines and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the economist head of the Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be done but rather difficult.
"And that is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give you your good visa as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that you reach that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed Fight: MP3 Player against Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player manages to make calls.
What seems clear is that it's better to buy just the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the manner in which it is used and on the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to acquire the most modern record player to listen to in it the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to keep buying them.
If the vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues are swallowed in their shelves, he's probably dreaming of at least this type of music.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
It also decides the battery duration
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even what they don't even have most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions like phone calls, send messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even get to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone before the screen indicator will be illuminated by requesting reloading.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragones.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, mostly less.
In this sense, the music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If besides this, above all, they constantly call themselves still, for safety, a charger for the work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only one part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some drives without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Seeker and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, interest in the accumulator's resistance, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as background and you'll hear it every day just for a while, like on the tram, then you just have any cell phone to play.
What virtually gets virtually any cell phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which your mobile phone or player plays music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that reaches it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and excepting it the absolute majority of devices reproduce music in WMA format.
At least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Just through the mobile internet visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weight argument to acquire a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the issues of radio’s fleeting success.
Prices are also the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either for GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you'll find your mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry earphones or at least handfrees.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile phone even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entrance for classic headphones.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles anyone.
The minimal functions, their management similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the playtracks are evident.
It does not pose a threat in that we mistakenly connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, gigantic account for downloading data.
By which device should be decided
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card you will reach the 2,000 crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only 2 GB card with maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cown, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) more than 1,100 crowns are not required.
If considered from among the most demanding lovers of music get the hands of the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones on the walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category at price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is going to arrive this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won't be long before we get there.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) has warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming fees, it is likely to become paradoxical - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than sending them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Also the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a marked price drop to which the classic operators must also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in Britain, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can be successful.
Otherwise, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the launch of the Virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after half a year did this operator obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are enough with many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large costs in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, often goes against the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers at least half of the cost-effective SMS with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it may also be a good blow to bet by a trivial target group.
This operator specifically addresses the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could be involved in our country.
From this, Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the supply of services it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem to be too hopeful.
Rather, it's about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in a phone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he assured that current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile phone services.
And how much sooner, better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group spokesperson Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they'll light up better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specific features of the Czech market concern other operators.
T-mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "So far we have not registered any viable commercial projects that can, bilaterally beneficial, continue to develop."
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operators until the end of the year.
At this point we should have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied on such a short horizon."
Vodafone directs its attention rather than to the fulfilment of the proper requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this to be the biggest customer contribution.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile."
Responsible offices - with operators and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon came up.
Perhaps the greatest pressure to ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:phon by the T-Mobile society.
Public information accessible on ČTú websites attests to this.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the ČTU's position, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Auctions (UOHS).
However, she expressed her typical attitude to this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a convention on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
To date, no agreement has been closed since the offer of interested potentials was not interesting enough for classic operators," added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of operators.
For the offices that should represent the interests of consumers it is something more than a consideration, besides that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreign where virtual operators work normally we can see that their market entry contributed to the price drop in mobile telephony services"
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices does not fall within the UOHS interest.
Truly the dramatic shock in all this case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, it is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations, as it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has not found any sign of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore have a corresponding rise of responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing as well as telecommunications regulators," added Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Obviously there is an analysis of relevant markets drawn up by ČTÚ that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to arise it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise remarkably in a similar manner.
The current complaints from stakeholders (inspired by the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators they collide with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility at ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We have already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of ČTU's competence in the field of trade tenders was introduced recently, even though a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one's looking
At the same time, unobviously something like a pseudovirtual operator continues to work, which already exists a few in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
Magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company by charging a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be discovered, they could talk about infringement in terms of contract conditions that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given company," answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile telephony operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned can come to be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they get no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a contemptible so many percent of customers.
They must also accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of operators."
This is precisely what ČTU should think of as minimally strange.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it it must not be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of this story and that its commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves more or less from this disruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases defended operators but their customers.
Out with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and others began to emerge with it.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this information between the background is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile telephony market will probably start moving again.
If one of the operators lets a virtual mobile telephony operator enter, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official anthem recording Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are assigned to the song.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said that it intentionally elected for the solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, too, with the Choir to be fixed in the diction so that the text would be understood well, so that it would have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home played for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his own.
The first stanza of the song following the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague's MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously upload it on their chip card at the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the Metro, Muzeum, Mëstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
The bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket sales posts at the metro stations, where so far they had to regularly line up to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the Internet, and the Opencard card is charged to one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff that helps interested people with Internet purchase and also with the reloading of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus in the Opencard on automatic vending machines located in some halls of the metro.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker machine and the travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
The electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the circus trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that sets the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The circus buses have their cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
By doing so, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel on circus buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bonus can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The South-Easters wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum.
The German Sudets asked in 1945 that Smokeba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Swedes Germans were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
In view of the fact that the Czechoslovakia union with the south-east Germans presumably presupposes - according to these Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president who assumes for today and for ever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way cooperates with the victory of the allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States presumably doubted about this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the šumavas lands on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists the expectations of the Germans in the southeast of the time.
Even though the Czech Germans had to understand at least that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the Republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudets some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed this.
This was in the war, as German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, he said, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Goods they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The Minister's office, Aleš שebíček promises to deter drivers from driving dangerous behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and from alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind them that before starting, belts are held.
It wants to gain awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embroider emotions.
And for this we are witnessing the "bloody" announcements throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written with big letters in the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that a man at a time of stripping may be able to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers it is worth the sugar and milk system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a light is passed in red and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that's why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specific psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinian and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all the (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We are sure to stay with a few percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them one percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that Jerusalem would also be included in the case of restitution.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which several deaths and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historic place" located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which from their point of view is an inherent condition to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they'll have to take off to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hizbulá (the cheetah movement), they will have to withdraw from the permanent support of Hamas (the cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus fares illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long bus
Regarding the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua we have the question of whether snails and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the saffata is opposed to the road transit law," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the twenty-two-year-old roof was killed was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the precise time when the saffato distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no place to go standing, which confirmed the company's director Radim Jančura to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on if they have a seat," he told us.
The saffata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the saffata - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term "Vehicle Reviewer", whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less sharply, Speaker Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban areas, where there are places to stand and maximum speed limited, interurban places to stand with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to go to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a seat belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s safety expert on transport, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the saffato on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger threat, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
Not even here is the sureness of the turbulence coming and that the saffata can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly slows down that physical laws are valid.
Same thing as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the saffata must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier", he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of tailors.
He's working on it for two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the sitter is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks saffata in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have any snails, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident of the line joining Naples a young Pilsen saffata died who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to prevent it, however, collided with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the break of the roof were sold.
"These sites can't be booked for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait until the trial verdict on the girl's family's compensation but waits for the financial expenses of the culprit as well.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision about the movement of the saffata on the bus in which for a year, thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not come to any specific conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of snails something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," concluded spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is based in Frankfurt
In the letter from the Board of Directors of the West LB bank for its employees there are no big words missing.
The merger of Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can form a ‘central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group’, as the written report states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the `Competition Block' with sustainable benefit capacity would enter into such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, much has been said about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August indicated that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the Board of Directors of the DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area the name of the DEKA bank with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation at one time seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as plans were made public, Hesse's government spoke against Helaba's involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian Parliament elections are over, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba, that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although it has so far emerged much better from the financial crisis that the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank, it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, that's going to show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena is watching him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 participants in Oktoberfest that low sounds can produce in your throat.
First Elena gives Luca a hand, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 a.m. three buses, `Munich direction, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the car park next to its flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-coloured flaps, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to Octoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and the German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the calm reigns on the bus, the travelers are asleep.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowscersiviggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop are opened, that means walking!" cried Mark in the morning.
"Go away!" Go and take the back places in the campaign shop.
"Don't take the places ahead, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over space!"
A liter of beer, tears Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He's just getting out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half o'clock you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now they're all going to Octoberfest.
One, to mark the way, even yellow caps in the trees, signs of traffic and even in a cartel of the elections of a great popular party in Bavaria.
It wants to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and tormentfully enter the tents, 10 percent of them all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistical of the present nations, where the Italians, with over 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The banking system in Germany is relatively stable, only last week the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück stressed.
Well, that the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate finance, which is listed in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to be able to resist the turbulence in the market.
On Monday, one person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Royal Estate will use has to throw interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Defa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financials with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only a short period of time - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the cash bank's capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the equity share delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued revenues of financial investment and net profits of financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of provisions of the credit business tended to fall by more than 70 per cent, to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the high and large revenues of reimbursements of compensation costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the consortium's companies, the negative balance could account for a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financial was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which was a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be earned from the financing of State projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of group losses and gains, it is said very inaccurately.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, the Royal Estate became an important state and financial financial financial in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits dropped essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Royal Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets which are now essentially not capable of functioning"
Other sources say that this money guarantees refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) are based on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
The voice was that in the last Sunday hour the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least worried people.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, the course of the loans according to the position in the ownership register clearly tends to fall.
Affected mainly are the loans of former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturitys exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Royal Estate, the present value of its loans that were formerly an investment for speculation must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, while one can start from amortisation of pensions in time.
Or something is going to happen, which is not likely to be imagined by anyone - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the cross-news about partial status, now the security that is already within its limits became a justifiable hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights without sleep, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still finalize and use the new account transportation of losses for future payments of benefits compensation taxes on change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Highschool in Tachibana the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was scared before I went to school.
I live on the Tokyo border in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
I just had to find my way, lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had been touched to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have stabbed, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I slipped quickly in my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in recreation, they all took out their blessings.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of seabirds in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, the benefits are not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artistically made vent for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
About that I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why precisely Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I'd rather read Mangas for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me I was absolutely sure that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a flak for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger runs away, why did he also fear?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in the same way as we do, feel the same way?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about feeling and in general about consciousness, we get into the unknown field because hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: he gets killed, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, almost always they include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and in the executive functions that direct conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if the conscience did not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured because it has special hardware, it does not allow itself to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking their contents into account, and that is what happens during short primate memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential goes more to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: Both may be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what happens to the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for it, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, so does Jaak Pankseep, but it concentrates more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, that is possibly felt in two cases as well: But how can one control whether rats and men behave in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, can you because he's scared?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
This is true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have brain stems similar, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology, while the same is true of rats and men.
As I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platinum: grace term for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is a lot to do."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries are busy.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do high-speed jobs," said the president of a association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After many scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platinum that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone, many clubs in the first division were condemned because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Indignant Dennis Quaid counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The late war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story about the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of Meg how many times tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again, "will remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin pope.
And so ends his statements by highlighting: "Whatever my life goes on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels are coming down
In the first half of 2008 plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's tickets.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap up to 50 percent.
The airline tickets and overnight stays in hotels were again cheap - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express's travel services and financial services.
The company has analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared with last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in travelling decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London rather than in industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the rise in kerosene prices, travellers of the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights were even more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is, on the one hand, the increase in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussian Luhukay still doesn't come out to make the top ten goal.
Kristoffer Klein very well presented the forced landing of the player of the national Marko Martin selection.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
Everything I wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," Silbaba Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance to Hamburg Stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physical therapist of HSV, enjoys a great reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers on a sign of consent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the chief coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't accomplished.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, Hamburg's SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday it will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their later forced players such as Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric golfer as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the kipo cannot shine with its successes.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, fear spreads.
The first news about the failure of the bank rescue package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important barometers of the bag in the world contributed a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At the moment the largest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Bank shares Goldmann Sachs lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "possible" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid suddenly but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the receipts of options for actions for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state fund.
Action courses in Europe and in the US continue to fall
One billion aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate is down and negatively affects the Dax.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Losses of the speculative shares of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the part of the federal government and private banks, the action of the Munich real estate finance for a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and contributed to a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's 700 billion-dollar rescue package is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it was 10,809,25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the salvation project, the Senate vote can be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the ACC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese main index Nikkei after profits dropped to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that participations in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark Matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be disturbed: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatening a cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during the gravitational assistance of maneuvers, has caused a confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
They are more frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
He was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with so-called Dark Matter, where astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
It is supposed to possess the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells of the most important cases.
It seems that European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
About this the same information features Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news of the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'We now control your health status,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as its eight Egyptian escorts are fine and are in security, reports the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting prior to the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," said the guard.
It was just a matter of "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had killed six kidnappers and two of them had detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "brought suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians in Cornwall, was sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, knew that he had regularly attached to his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley house in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended by saying, "I used to tie her and wink her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, if she hadn't, the matter probably wouldn't have ended in court."
And he added: "I noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to criminalize.
BBC correspondent for Defense Frank Gardner reported that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face at a price of over £80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank rescue/rescue.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion pounds of sterling to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan shall be paid by all undertakings using the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members must pay "humillate"
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest due in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this issue.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved cautiously ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were far less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price," added Cole.
Interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of eligible interest, which could be almost twice as much.
Since the construction societies are mutual organisations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest in their savings.
The milk price rises by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the higher milk price had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denied release on bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison upon return to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by charging him with extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption in your charge.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, militarily supported, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that as long as he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what are the terms of his release or if he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad on parole," counsel Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We're going to bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to what a leader of the Awami League reported last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges.
Fears for the campaign against poliomyelitis in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan, says the UN, have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polyomyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said it occurred despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopio Office reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce his ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, would have given up his voting rights.
New investigation into the recruitment of US lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of administrative officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine US lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate complaints of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, gave up his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney-General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and stresses that he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, which "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album that Meat Loaf won in 1977.
Coldplay's group are taking the nominations for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained in the rankings for about nine years and was able to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - Real name Marvin Lee Aday - has experienced health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it came up that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including the old taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty street more than an active road.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
that wants to repair Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented to be enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the past block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee of the Community of Vengeance for the Use of Land this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to have Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street arose for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, she didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that he obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The rear door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that rises on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the bourgeoisie of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they are, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a city king that should be protected.
Jeremia Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and unexplained street, also dark by day and marked by iron doors oxidized and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that you could get a clean one.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimated the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in reversing the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low incomes:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of students in the fourth year, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent have dominated the English language test and the arts.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama has favoured.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Calle, the focus of the school for the instruction of English to students is on the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means almost exclusively the use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education is the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is true that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The share of crude oil decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning negotiations at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before regressing, once again, due to the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized the investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to what the government said this Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem to have been unable to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected to lower the demand for commodities, including oil.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and forecasting a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: equipment sets record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a deflate game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the shadow of the clouds.
At this moment it occurred that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranes Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect forearm for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when one cornerback fell and another arrived 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said from all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the defense of the Cardinals mistreated the quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a round shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, Bowens' fault could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession of 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 3.4.
These are the major points the Jets never made in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselasie headlines his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown because many consider him the greatest runner in history, overcoming his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable plain race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in an impressive length race, so he has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
On the other hand, he went for a run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a few shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps in the pantorilla two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the object of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a racetrack, and putting the records in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pacemaker decreased.
But just before three miles from the target, Gebrselassie took a final impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She did not take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as an injury on her back, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record in almost five minutes at the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head-on and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third place at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proofs of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, just a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not one prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to Zora every year! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city that she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going to be lost."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many remain cautious in front of the outside world.
"We are very careful about the way our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the South Black - sometimes derogated, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's not surprising if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
A And the concern for Eatonville's image really started for Zora, as nobody here calls it Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialectic books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
With a face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston brought her readers to the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston refers to Eatonville and self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Foundry did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as an eccentric living person who returned often after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without prior notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, said Mr Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-way main street in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration had, inter alia, brought to an end the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around town shooting oranges and every thing against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown against a sledgehammer in the car."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the breakdown of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural gap there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boyante, confidence and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker left to the anonymous tomb of Mrs. Hurston and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter went under the spotlight again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurgent idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call speed of curvature, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Record in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a remodeled and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from the centre of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A A permit in advance is necessary to make most of the interviews, and some things - such as the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hudson festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way as Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and also to other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew, Mr. Franklin Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, they all talk about finances.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize to be in the hurricane's eye.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nested offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York are faced daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 Basin.
Girls for home delivery continue to resonate their metal baskets for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of charged apartments, like human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their morning meal, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still expect to line up for their bagel to the salesmen's carts, but it's impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there is, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time required for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout life order their cheque heels, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's big warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trustful personal banker," and they were queued for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already taken their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction society), the credit unions and the savings boxes of their home city whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and who say they treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, broke down, and as New Yorkers were heading to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and stores that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Field, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something uniform concierge from my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the shopkeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Desecrated Muslim tombs at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgium, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citizens Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the extreme right political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, where the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic Community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which came to the Muslim religious when the month Ramadan was over.
In the meantime, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took over almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the head scarfs and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamist policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A Judge's Service spokesperson said: "On Thursday, September 25th, at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad like that to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd didn't attend in person.
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, under the registration of sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to notify the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss Glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him the entrance and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Judges, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacquii Smith, the Minister of the Interior calmed down and rejoiced to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
"Capt to the master out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no premiere outfits.
The essence of the great teachers of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable save in intimacy, at those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, carefree because they will not go out to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... captiveing to the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the flamenco's great."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started a long journey in 1,997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a board camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical base of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dune that is made visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits presented in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment into their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or meet people, characters, who sometimes you don't know, or who just let you take the picture for a few minutes.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Gallery El Fotómata, located on the 20th street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fearlessness"
It is set in places that do not yet know and talk about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies "is a fear" and that "all indicates that it should not write" the novel.
"If it was sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometimes," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he's been passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens's "Our Mutual Friend", filled the outside of the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a given audience to whom it was made very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extordinary adventure" of the "pleasing to read" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and remaking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis upon which their stories are supported.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and to know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more incompetent", so he asked the writers "not to give up on frivolity" and "take up with responsibility" his vocation.
The climate decreases the fair of Pozoblanco that is also left without regions
The regional celebration that closed the subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announcers that the square floor was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The meteorological impairments have been overcrowded with this fair, since two of its three festivities have finally not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco.
So, only Friday had a celebration.
In him, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid his two auctions with greetings and an ear, which granted the tendons more than his bull.
That is, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of The Plains without grief or glory.
In his second bull, after a wave of relief he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
A check is skipped in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armiñón (Alava).
Agents stop the two occupants of a van and they run the flight.
His burden, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
They were chased and arrested by one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., as reported in a communiqué by the Basque Government Interior Department.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport check at the N-1, as they passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were prepared to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated sharply, and skipped control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the arcade, when its two occupants rushed to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized of the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, so they proceeded to transfer to police units for a comprehensive and weighing inspection of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so a public document falsification offence has also been charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as stated, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was transferred to police units to conduct the related proceedings and will be available for trial within the next few hours.
Stops actress Heather Locklear by driving under the effects of some medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
One witness saw her perform strange maneuvers when trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Road Patrol in People magazine.
The witness has explained that over 4.30 hours, Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and when going back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"He seemed disoriented," so the agents took him to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol excess was discarded from the very first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison about 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of a Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Lalamares urges the Andalusian Federation of UI to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of UI and Deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the training that will have to take a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of Seville City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing family benefits.
"For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Llamazares on the action the party must adopt with which so far councillor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always argued that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspiring in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a broad list of interpreters.
May's blood, with a film exceeding two and a half hours, is released this Friday in the cinemas, to become a future miniseries for Telemadrid more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures he has fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community three years ago commissioned him to film a memorial tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted always and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget provided by the Madrid Community as a whole constitutes a "one-time opportunity" for Garci to set up with the decorations and the appropriate costume the portrait of "an atolondrated Spain which was mistaken as a leader to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding like that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Return to begin with, has had an impact on what his usual way of working is, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before the shooting and those who do not cast, as it seems "humilant" and consider that "part of the director's office is to go to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who coincide in May's Blood repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larragañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood itself of May, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected one, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known", he has assured.
With this film Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you're happy with making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevilla dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevilla dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when he was three years old moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corse which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of interwars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, just as she did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
"Matilde makes Tortola of the eldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that you have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honoured for it."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rap of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who always walk in love with them."
The work also somehow recounts the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all over Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now nobody knows and much less value their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 20.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a New-born Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is framed within the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Andalusian Board to celebrate the "Trienium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition "John Ramón Jiménez: That flood of light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Similarly, the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recentified Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausence of Malice", and gives the idea of the American film's disappearance, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
Look what it cost them to give him an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that you knew he was very sick.
Still, it's been a pile for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to make the ridiculous or exaggerate.
He had killed a father of cinema and homeland at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is time and without virtue the men and very few beings that admire you remain, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and trueness.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and livestock causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn killed by overdose to his brand of home and organic food.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood neighborhood admiration without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left the list very high on us all," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try it, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he was probably left with the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is assisted by the pride that his daughters on earth coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, of none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are celebrated in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and I think it's been the worst race I've ever been in.
A lot of misconceptions that, of course, if they took it into account as an assessment and I would examine it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
Disproposals start with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they already make you go to give it all away (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Not at all.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first purpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the t-shirt (second purpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer and cheaper fabrics because of the crisis?
Well, things like these are a minute compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go too soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes the wait lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait for more than 40 minutes, which was joined by contaminants of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think about 500 people will certainly have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, this wouldn't get into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, it has shown a breakthrough in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move on the company's campus) responding to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him he will be there soon.
All without blue display.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we have talked a lot about a change in strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of loaded commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing its importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went out to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly noted that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer for Hardware and Software to understand.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but one has to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I have a small example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond, early in the month.
In the refreshment machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by 2010.
In Microsoft you will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass by bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was reading one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we start to list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp, sharp moustache that raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical male underwear in cotton, ash and no sleeves.
The 'tank', who call the English speakers, but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands on top of all the others.
First of all, because of its rewarding name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above others for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the Belgian small flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail in the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine T-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have created my sister Penelope and me for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the movies of the 1950s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like getting lost in a city and watching women get dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything is united and has many bonds in common.
I liked my clothes as a child; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to hang in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I was always trying to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers love to make us our style for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you actually find the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You did it not long ago, 30 years ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me for it, and besides, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're looking at a number of premieres that you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm already looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, cannot be.
I look forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
See what they look like...
A few days ago, you started on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a little walkway to make a model.
Just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we display - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part that she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if you can ask me to make the pine, too.
To benefit women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Repeated drivers of alcoholemia must install the 'alcolock'
Inside you want the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, you have to install in your vehicle a system that prevents you from booting the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney-General ' s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is to re-integrate the driver, so that the driver will also receive a course of re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Instituto Tecnológica para la Seguridad del Car (FITSA) Foundation will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the car drivers reported more than once for driving drunk again take the car.
The alcolock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the air and prevents the car from booting if the driver does not blow; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than the allowed one.
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and it would run for the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and, however, criminal reform requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been piloted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time for the program landed at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling.
The sun was retreating but his rays still forced him to use his hand so as to see the real couple come down from the plane.
On the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before I had asked on the street, to the taxi driver, if I knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps had told him that in the DF threatened the storm.
They give a smile and a listening stop to the photographers before they go to the room where the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel in which you stay, one of the city's four big ones, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for you.
The Best Fashion-Equipped Prize
Possibly there is no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly there is no living designer more exquisite and bont viva than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It's equipped with a €300,000 prize.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the Mango window at number 54 of the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest shop of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the event, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, read even more spectacular.
Nati, with heart broken with grief and heart-breaking, for his brother's recent death, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH ties, which cut the breath, and of the arm of his son Luis - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he finished, next to the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner it was transformed with a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'grand plie'.
Ines Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but first he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon moving by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's the life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And by the way, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on 30 September.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the hectic pace that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the working world.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book an entire 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' denies such belief.
It also offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very often telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk are asleep.
The first time it happens at best you get scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called dreams.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them have been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to sleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be like this.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or the other way around (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating much anxiety and gives him out in this way.
We have said it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress table).
What you can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or TV series that are either scared or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the sleepwalks appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during various episodes you should check out or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the usual), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Also you will hear what it says, but you do not know what it is dreaming to say that, so be very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to sweep the squad with a long shot, Illhaeusern almost would take the "power" and turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
On the front, we didn't let the camper pass and we left only Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Temporale goals for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the rejected ball in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousiens golfer will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousians who retreated a bit to "compress" his defense, except in the last few seconds of play during which, after an important farfill, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds the angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hoped that " he would come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in gas oil prices, which marks a record at the time of reaching 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to regain their competitiveness and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in blocks of almost 10 km.
The sport port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their burning determination, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bulls stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and one destiny " died of cancer, at age 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also greeted the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats in the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains his forecast of delivery for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Embraer's president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder trusts much in the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
IGA would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been taken out of trouble thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this paper states.
The AIG board met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its subsidiary of air leases, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer and its portfolio and investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it at risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is a loss never seen in the Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important drop in its history (684,81 points) had been recorded on 17 September 2001, i.e. the day the exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks on 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, the technological dominant, went back 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the index enlarged(wide) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have made it possible to regain some stability on the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he asked for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," thought Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market was counting on this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the Central American Bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further," said Brian Bethune, Chief of Economics and Finance of Global Insight.
And emphasizing more the sense of urgency, " every day that passes, the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis skyrocketed, causing emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The return of the 10-year treasury bonus was 3,632 %, compared with 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus was 4,161 %, compared with 4,357% on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House another happened to find out who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No wonder the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "sufferable enough" to allow him to slow down his casualties in the polls to five weeks after the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned, however, this weekend.
Septuagenario McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing his opponent's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first concern.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without bewildering himself, he showed himself concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it," he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans."
"During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainstorm.
He did not speak the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favours Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode ", he estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final result of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the Wall Street surges, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of any energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates evaded the issues of the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk," have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator, must resign ".
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "for what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made it good for foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They didn't follow the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, it is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament can mean TV shows, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process would not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26 % of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the electoral centres.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again to the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had been seriously vacillated by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started his activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, says Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence ", says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population had the successive confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is something extremely fragile " .
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we refused the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us how the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleid acid testing that directly detects the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies to the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the moment the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products every year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries," said Héma-Québec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus, such as the West Nile virus, appeared on the island of the Meeting, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant ", Dr. Décary chases before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since the most aggressive anticancer treatments, patients often need injections of red blood cells or platelets.
Ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that regroup on average only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network have to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all, to hold them back and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," is distressed Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million a year, Héma-Québec not only supplies blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this blood-taking program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this," as Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) at the cost of the Seattle Sounders yesterday during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series at the Saputo Stadium.
The camper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time anywhere, the camper David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who beat up Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the series of matches back and forth on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take him for 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced with the Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – The victorious goal of Kovalev
Three number one Canadian is ready to begin the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn’s compound unit led the Canadian’s 3-2 win against the Florida Panthers at the Bell Center last night.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russians.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play maximum in the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the labour force with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts, nor a precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This " land twice as large as France " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is he at our house, but he is in us," he insisted, as to show that he requested a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gilding towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, having taken a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I repeat that position on the part of the government " , he said.
Furthermore, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec party in Ungava), have already begun consultations around thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and on which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision " will be given.
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be agreed, orderly and environmentally friendly ", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to turn the challenges into new occasions of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois Central be renamed at Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party knew how to forge the future," Juan Charest said.
At the press conference, she invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, applauding.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which is permitted by law.
She stressed that her schedule was nevertheless full, particularly as a result of a mission by the Board of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York York Summit.
The general weekend council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems with being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party in particular called for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto right over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up implementing it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that was made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on the part of the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letras - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "hate" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves our admiration for everything she says about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not returned to its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were recriminalized occurred to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and allows a child soldier to live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who grieves with false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't matter to you that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of excisions.
We do not yet realize that, but at this moment we witness an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist any more: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far has wanted (what will happen after October 14th ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what our country's reputation and dignity did.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In his September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euros defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecution, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who will dare to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by scratching.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects requests and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word only designates highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-bitter (persecuting the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada intimating them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease rich companies in this world in a country such as Canada, who can do so under much persecution?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unprovoked persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he wants, he does not feel like making a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for Governments to place devices that limit this type of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that seeks to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It foresees in particular: better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of embarked houses the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a negotiating marathon lasted two days.
" We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening up of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have been late in the negotiations, were rather favourable to the agreement, while not forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to retain their domicile and the salary of the leaders of state-survivors.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable ".
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, the risk and unsold assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freezing of liquidity and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of clearing roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that provided that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
Instead of helping you, Washington will get shares in the rescue companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures relating to housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all its efforts, it is not yet certain that its plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand ".
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers ".
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group by 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced buying its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain."
During this time, across the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take care of all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one who would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their modesty, their sensitivity, and their obvious talent will also have led him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great back corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons of American cinema in the late years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked much like and who was long considered a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and exploding of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No self-measured, last quality mark.
Because in it an entire country in love with self-made man, of the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked in second position in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we don't know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused the vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while their great roles on the black screen of memories were intertwined.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cow-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of cinema.
This Boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lies Me (Hate Marked), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
It is a nice manganant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he valued in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
He's still there.
Times change during your career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role of patron of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes' Road to Loss in 2003, the ruffle was ruffled.
Contrary to a number of film legends that left the race pretty soon, Newman stayed very much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fascists and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humor, " as a challenge living in " underplaying " and judging his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young than marginal Galan: neurotic, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman showed aside his true púdic sensibility not well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of horror and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were given to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood's excesses.
We have seen a lot of his face reigning over the boots of vinegar sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag invoicing factory &amp; Co. ?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuchlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with committing fraud of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with false invoices.
Public and city funds - as a whole some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accusation, most invoices were false.
For this they obtained the heels in the Józsefvaros District market and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and they served as a model for making the invoices they presented, among others, in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András 的ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zushlag and its accomplices, this food center provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of a hundred and thirty people.
But great fanciful invoicing manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed out to the food center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he already knew it was fake documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not many people belong.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has been out of operation for a while.
The enthusiastic invoicing manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest exclusively organizes travel abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company were not charged with 25 but only 15 percent VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, "transponders" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false stamp - the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are also known to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The counterfeiters did not pay any attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The invoices were sent consciously
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers consist of those who were aware that they should issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued invoices worth some four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredert.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the charge - convinced him one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers include those that have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictional headquarters in Budapest, who was involved in the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunellas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it shipped on behalf of the company invoices for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány by charging the amount itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian albañiles at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not get a job.
But it took advantage of these companies, since at the request of their accomplice counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices to the companies' names for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities with a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov to receive VAT and 10 per cent of the invoices.
This man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri company to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the competition they got 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the competition.
In order not to find out, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the head office of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing could be the confession of the principal defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest does it have in doing?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied him.
While the many perpetrators of economic crimes of far greater value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can expect the judgment in their own home, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other took part in a auction and while the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called strata located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self-priming nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention in order not to cause an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups wagered against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
In addition, another group was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prizes.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winer" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only the visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the college of economics at the University of New York, established.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
Around the world, some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver and jaundice infections are characteristic, but their pathogens and disease are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are propagated by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and body humors (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers are protected by vaccine against A and B virus, and no vaccines are available from C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifests through a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that they appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent slowly destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooers.
There are currently about 200 million people worldwide suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September, the World Hepatitis Day was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who believe in God?
According to a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same amount of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which, alongside academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they fixed a chipping instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their gaze in two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and to the Lady of the Armiño of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the painting of religious theme or the other.
The Catholics said that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as people "protected", "the peace was calmed down and in their hearts peace reigned".
Observing the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can get a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as for a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what would be the effect on the regulation of pain if shown to the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
At its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it in the people's pocket, as well as in the sky above your head; you know where your vacations were spent, what doctors visit and what interests you.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that led to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied as follows: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple until there is enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their network navigation the search keywords, IP addresses, and the pages where the search ended.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-enquire what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by viewing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over the information on its website, Orkut, to the Brazilian government to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who were concerned about people's rights, in May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that he was right in his dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points in the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain its pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search sentences, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think their privacy, their private life are harmed by starting to use Google's services, and rebel against it as against conservative multinational image companies.
Meanwhile, the American Geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, categorized by its Windows as conqueror of the World, however much that both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the program package is free, constantly updated and looks more young, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of them vary individually, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored automatically in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases from which it turns out that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or can fire the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion in her blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what it shows of itself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of youth today.
And if you want to hide something, or at least try to avoid Google's monopoly, you can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but it leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but you can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than the IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while the services that are introduced more and more rapidly cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
The critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the top management flatly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's child care, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' food, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google yielded to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violates the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new services in advance, but only when it's ready to work, what if it's certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn the world around: while some believe that Google's scanning and book archive project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in an orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the mark of the author of the double murder of the city of ozd.
Police questioned two minors about Ózd's double murder who, according to suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod province.
Young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently accused of perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant of ozd's double murder - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man prepared long before to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously concealed in the scene of the crime.
The police analyse with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for 100 percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolowski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by the stakeholders for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week stated that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly profound international financial crisis speak of a "second September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - La República de Roma - the President has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose objective is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which Warren Buffett's multi-millionaire investor was talking about, it's more correct to speak of a "second September 11th."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the error of the US political leadership was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing more and more and more, and this will have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - points to the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw a life belt on the financial institutions tottering, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominos collapse even more bank, then they will no longer be enough neither the new funds, nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday over €100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are increasingly real.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that occurs as a landmark for the Old Continent .
"Savers" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bulldozer
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example that of the suburbs.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the Beejorres gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of BR23C-like cars that mimic nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the bullfighters, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can dodge all the collisions.
During the flight each bulldozer creates its own ovulated private space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of PR and development and research.
An important role is played by the eyes composed of the beekeepers that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the beehives, modifies the direction by rotating the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and of the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a beehive to dodge other beehives.
This process must be carried out in a opening and closing of the eyes.
However, unlike the beeholes, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonals, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turning the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bees to dodge other bees, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and acceleration in addition the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is higher, which means they have a longer life span than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less the storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, within ten years can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding existing obstacles on his way.
You already have a name for this dearest child
The written version of the law of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared to be applied at various stages in order to purchase the bad loans from banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to the hours of the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until midnight on Saturday, the congress leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have achieved significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, stating that the agreement is just missing in a document.
The commitment made to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving the Wall Street, but about turning it back into the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, Monday will vote first for the North American Congress and then for the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend every $700 billion to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, from this amount, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it may buy at the same time bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" type credits.
Purchases can be made either directly or at auctions - competent persons of the ministry have been informed.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which may even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, insurance or risk prevention that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for State aid may have the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang called simply golden parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank is retired.
By buying the bad credits directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not overrated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the revenue of the directors generals - said this measure by Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of the taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to obtain even profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill over the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what we were given by American citizens, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to increase
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to last month prices and 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 prices - reported by the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH).
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent over the previous month and by 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimum, with 0.1 per cent.
Internal sales prices in the processing industry increased by at least 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), primarily due to an increase of 4.6 per cent per month in bags and belts and an increase of 2.5 per cent in footwear.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical material production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first of all as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a period of 12 months - in the domestic sales of the processing industry - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, beverages and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Over the past year in the processing industry globally increased prices by 10.2 percent.
The prices of electricity, the supply of gas, heat and water exceeded 18.7 percent of the prices of the previous year.

A 6.8 per cent decrease in consumer goods was recorded in the consumer sector and 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The export prices of the industry calculated at HUF increased by 1.1 percent over the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The contribution of our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent with respect to the euro and 7.1 per cent with respect to the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 per cent with respect to the euro and 15.9 per cent with respect to the dollar.
Will next year no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waiver to enter into force on 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, " virtually everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on time on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that the entry premise would disappear in the new system, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy has been holding talks in Washington.
He will interview the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by delivering the Middle Cross with the Merit Order Star of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured on Sunday their support for the government's $700 million bank support program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and Administration, after several marathon-style negotiations, announced in the early hours of Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when economic issues were put to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage and lost McCain's advantage after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the 700 billion-dollar package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger the employment, the savings of you. in addition to the whole industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to label McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "we will all take this hard to feel ... but not doing anything is simply not a viable path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Fines and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the most conscious voters became - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rogue coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polithologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had assumed its position.
The social-Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on them.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s .
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have been forecasting this for 40 years, but in the rhythm they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of Northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that the most conscious, more critical and stubborn voters became within the group itself.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks, the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones that have moved more away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those with baccalaureate and the graduates.
This was less than 40 percent of support for the CSU.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, while greens still do not wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely saw anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, at the post of Vice Chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer responded cautiously to red offerings.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Jaróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris. Its host is France, who is also President of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fides, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma remain outside the labour market first because of their low level of schooling.
"Most Roma young people have not finished middle school and due to poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can obtain university degrees."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, also plays a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, these issues need to be widely made aware of both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the sooner a Gypsy student starts school, the more likely he will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumption they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and to ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Jaróka.
According to the Euro MP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up school disaggregation processes immediately. That is why it is essential to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility which guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-right citizens," Jaróka said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off on the summits of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in office, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-recognised duo made a statement: they don't hold on to their posts.
They thus sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will no doubt have to coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and right-wing free voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the parliament, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the coup of Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also be given an active role that so far has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU rated September 28 as the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 elections of the Bundestag, Merkel cannot be a foreign minister if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide his disappointment because of failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the social democrats.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained with the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandre Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one-hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before the elections of yesterday's united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate following the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, would "allow" the entry of some members of the opposition into parliament as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time.
So the ODSZ removed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly relies more economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of more expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not give Lukashenko access to other high-level politicians for having an antidemocratic political regime.
It was a sign of distinuance when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, put emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the primary report of the OSCE Monday criticised even the campaign itself - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago considering the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - told our newspaper Alexandre Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow such an opponent to enter that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, but rather tries to get the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- That clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that it is increasingly those who support change among older people also - Milinkevich said, alluding that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate even for retired people, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "seems like the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike opposition politicians, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on she gets breakfast before she starts working"
It has never happened in Chigi Palace History that put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from now on it starts with this measure against whom you click and then you go to the bar to have a coffee at work.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister says.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is Reformism," Brunetta points out again.
With Palace Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is important also from the symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary General said: "It was a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of the employees."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and medium moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences from public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Service more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of 'low workers' are constantly increasing.
There are millions in Italy who are correct and productive civil service employees who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar answers the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by illness due to service; the extension of the time frames in which medical check visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions dear to the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crimal Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as possible with regard to homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy for victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data broadcast by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative efforts to prevent at work, protect injured workers, assist victims' families and raise public awareness."
"It has been manifested, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, facing tragedies that, because of their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislation.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini House has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an end urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away the number of white deaths is equally impressive," noted Anmil Pietro Mercandelli's president.
"We do not really want this "declining tendency" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our view - Mercandelli has stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers over a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary care provided for workers" and "assistance to which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - it has added - because the luck of the accident does not have to depend on the gift offered by the legislator each time."
Under-accused Mp3 readers, put hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music over a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, in a communication published in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day with the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic mobile phones may unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"From scientific evidence – the Ue liability follows – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must re-examine, in addition, existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they can be widely effective and have the transition with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it creates.
"Scientists - executive Ue concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduction of levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that portable music users hear loud (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current maximum noise limit at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today, in March it is closed, the accounts will be held in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fouto of the capital of Rome", which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its Lieutenant Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council will be able to come together later.
There is no remaining role position, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June – he announced – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
He who accuses the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, German replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are back and forth manifest.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long run, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The Italian leader of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future".
A future that, the ruler of Rome needs" would not be limited only to the present communal boundaries but would look beyond" not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that interests him to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
he wrote a Miami lady on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he has won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're attacks clearly racial in nature and they don't answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And there's also polls; they all say Obama won and with a good advantage.
In this case too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A diary of the Mississippi, in the entrails of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know who the American patriot will give his vote.
It comes out one side of the American mentality that is covered up to the last.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent has answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever assumes the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
It uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been interrogated by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, though, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, it is a major problem.
It is a problem that should be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism is not to be understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "murder" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between the newspaper leaders – the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with the "security of work".
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff, it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "disease" followed during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola that he had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is questioned by bankruptcy in the field of counter-contract investigation relating to the Unipol-Bnl climbing.
In the course of the arrest process in charge last week, he obtained his home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate be able to travel the city route of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has voted against) would allow you to influence your society and access to the evidence that they accuse you of it.
The elites at risk
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan put in place by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are confirmed by the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "the Washington Party" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become pre-potent with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This hardly mentioned is just an example of the mutations, of the large mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and emerge.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state and sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those who have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union that divides as always between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the time it comes to court it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the increasingly sophisticated technology network, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to be more and more accountable with the little immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at, can certainly be transported from place to place on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly possesses many more letters than he is, and who has the misfortune to live in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that was a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of poor economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various parts of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far at the height, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, that they have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, underground feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say none, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, that which is taking shape from today are the deep strata of Western society and that the renewed, growing and potentially agitated economic crisis.
In front of all this talk of a 'mass rebellion' today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the aim of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come closer.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 cm square, scientists have been able to have attached a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecos, covered with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "get off the walls easily" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING FOR PARADISE? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
For the moment no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, in California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers such as self-cleaning of dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, efficiency with severe health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, undoing the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing at toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
PARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drank in the case if you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Caruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not leave us to impress us, to ask clearly to the doctor or to the pharmacist" stressed the expert from the agency Ansa.
The Economy novel to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11th September 2001 attack, in those days that you broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that triggers much controversy and that for several years came reproached the economy, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but also a communicator with an "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less-glorious magazine interface, more consistent are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to multi-functioning with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create documents "PDF hybrids", which accumulate the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the drafting of texts, each employee is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to carry some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request can also be sent the installation cd to home or to work.
And if the theme of the gratuity can be a hook for broadcasting in houses, it is in business that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already having several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding word video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until now we have reached nearly 3 million 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classed and winner of the best climber row.
The news is the L'Equipe newspaper site.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive corridor to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood champions is among those performed in the last few weeks in the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the counter evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and rage against the two years of canonical dequalification.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself in the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, adjuring the best climber.
ITALY IS RACISTA?
Italy of a country of emigrant has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what is asked by the New York Times in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who had been killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of galletites.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation dear to the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence marked either by the Pope or by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism".
Student victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large number of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to bear – explains the head of the study office in Sonia, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has totally distorted the market to such an extent that it triggers a process of widespread increase even for residents."
Unless in most cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: free standard contracts, not registered, without limit of canon, sub-linked leases.
For Sonia, extraordinary interventions are necessary to regulate prices through the revision of the tax system.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for one bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for one individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for an individual room and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostian and Cinecittà).
It saves only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you can use 300/450 euros, for a room you can spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you can use 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the younger cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-Community is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
The historical cinemas close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographers effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion," observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that 20 years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, who recounted the poetry of a provincial cinema hall and nostalgia for the way to live the cinema that might be lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of the traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of the rooms in the main cities are to be paid: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 cinemas less, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are their own that have made the largest number of new methonic cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the metrons.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
In order to support the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year’.
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the proposed rules are means of tax facilitation for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking fees.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true that in order to contrast the extra power of the metrones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise Cinema", which I had thought of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side."
Link between politics and 'drangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The charges that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the chief officer and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the manager of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association, are heavy.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the same as the boss, already convicted by criminal association mafia and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despecting any legal and moral norms, and good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed – the judges write – to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of the control and command of the public administration."
The president of the regional board of Calabrés Agazio Loirero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
This morning's arrests are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the head cut of the Piromalli Mafia family.
Since the end of April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the burden of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's steward at the time of the dissolution, after the ballooning in May 2006, had been elected head of a right center coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, there emerges "the willingness to favour the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration elections on the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones descend to the stage
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years, and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was removed, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated by 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much as that produced by nuclear power plants at present.
And then there would be the currents and tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and more among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil rush to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems to the ecosystem.
To produce long-term energy, a technology with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good unions between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the good move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this kind in the process of development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are tides, turns the turbine pallets, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of customers awaiting the authorisations necessary to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, is currently worth the potential of tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 and a half in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
