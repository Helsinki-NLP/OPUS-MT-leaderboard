Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
Parliamentarians refused second reading the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for reaching an earlier disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's political revenge judgement and has provoked a process of biased bias of the court to the west as well.
The draft to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its defeat.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has enacted the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what this is all about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight we cut hands.
Women can forget emancipation, the potential non-respectors of faith are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Koran who will join instead of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya we will rule such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we certainly would not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably not beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted aid with the recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the attacks of NATO but rather Allah whom they celebrated the greatness of each attack.
So when it comes to seeking winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam and our politics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily with Libya.
Therefore, there is no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Without land tenure, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally boast of self-interested protection of human rights.
For as long as we keep these devotees from the sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight of investors.
A tornade of statistics happened on Tuesday over Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all the records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their economic development visions earlier in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries amended the data for the second quarter in which Germany positioned itself better than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office, it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to the expected and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what the analysts had foreseen.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
The 10-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are climbing towards critical limits.
Problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
In Germany , votes were heard to say that the ECB should be the last instance 's guarantee .
Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also been very fortunate in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed reporting.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the Super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure up to the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vices of the match were Damjanovic and Vuccinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the Super Petr Cech Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech Football Fund.
From the first minute we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to assemble combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not come to pervade the Czech defence, which accurately responded to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from universities in Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre in Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed their defence of their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear armament.
In Israel, a possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: don't eat breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren have overweight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the environment in which the human being and the models around it are.
For example, 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight are found in obese children's tables.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the investigation conducted with an awareness action "obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the small big sports is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary school students in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not an accident", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from 6th to 3rd enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or even obese, is the absence, of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast in case - lunch - taste - dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of the pupils' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his own breakfast.
And the worst thing that's ever been noticed is that a tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugar every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"Czech children's preferences between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sugared lemonades", is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it's pasta that took the first place right in front of white meat.
Children did not want any fertility and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session " Obesity is not an accident," a well-resolved desire to go to a healthy diet," indicates the results of the survey.
For example, the most striking was for sugary lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedlike" (Czech specialty of breadmeal or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen in the future.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what's going on.
And that'll be worse.
The closer we get to final reviews, the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "browed".
This time we have with Director Alenka (there is no boy in the course) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other one a body of boy, no particular curve, another one of the superweights.
The stylist should know how to optically trim large arms, lengthen a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight beautifully the character and also not to dress too conspicuously of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth the effort.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips permanently, rolls and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabric, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that, given what I have to do at home, there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep down, it pleases me, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodleboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only the physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and a graphic designer, has kept us from all this.
But that's... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look at the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single dress differently.
Variability is a prime example of this.
Like for example this trench-coat that must have been worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can dress also the naked body, with scarves and take it as a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with that," he remarked.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start breaking it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have much more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "cut" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this when creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer, but her image and marketing have made it a world star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists remains still fragile.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seemed to pass to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he probably dictates to us a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we just have to navigate on google and make sure if the boulevard info tells of the celebrity in question, whether it has lean or thick etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, don't flatter yourself, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his closet and fill it with new elements you cannot throw everything and tell him, My God what a horror."
"You will find some things you will find pretty and he will advise you with what to wear them," Mario said.
It has demonstrated to us in concrete terms what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, depilation rollers, or even feeding pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they might damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, to fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We didn't have the right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't hurt inadvertently.
So we really need skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The story I'm telling you about isn't about my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I am beginning to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally, a race without problems is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills to a certain extent the ambition of each but it serves no purpose if no one wants to do anything more.
The new section entitled The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to come out some sort of game from the playable parts that would not just count on points.
So we were curious about how the passages added in which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As already in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole shoots down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible pheneantisia on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them gets involved in illegal races across America.
You are sitting behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
The result is that each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful overcrowding even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more time-consuming with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to that, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There is only a small number of them, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the number of opponents (like in a classic race) then run against the watch ( classic duel with the timer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police that enter the game and try to make your situation difficult.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as well because this element is not likely to interfere and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you should go and see elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, collisions are not yet up to date.
We do not expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don't have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight overshoots you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy shells.
Or they're in socks.
Thanks to the restarting system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you broke your face or you went out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, if something doesn't happen as it should be, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution needs to be found by recalling the part of the route in question.
The great hyc of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way, otherwise that does not happen.
Otherwise you meet at a given location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute in delay.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and turn them around or brake them.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" so that for the given situation it always happens close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most annoying at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass before you.
When it passes before you it hides the view of other vehicles in the reverse and you collide a lot of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of Adredalin, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to be careful about petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars however most of the time the one you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. bicycles for straight highways and super sports cars around exotic roads on very technical routes, for example, on lace roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that are common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unfold:
This one connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the metro (sa-like) where you drive in the darkness on the tracks (sa-like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (priority) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the hardware.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is embarrassing is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is in choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself for the fact that the faults hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festival Festival Festival Academica for the third time offers festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs of high schools and secondary classes.
The festival was set up in two concerts organized on 17 November.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"There is the Choeur of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities in the festival committee sits the Vaclav Hampl Rector," says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The key to the festival is the Choeur des lycées and secondary classes concert, which takes place with free entry on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
In the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of Velours" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady, during which the choirs of the higher schools occur, as well as that of Charles University.
The aim of the Festival Academy is not only to celebrate the International Day of Students with dignity and recall the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public a music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Union of Czech Cherries in cooperation with the Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is placed under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, music meetings, student learning and other activities.
The interested parties will find all information on the Internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I wasn't expecting such a tough war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role", as well as Milena Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law by the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of speakers from Charles University Law School could send it, she showed how much she takes her motto "comprehensive and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning they echoed the criticisms that he is fade, that it is a round-hair, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that he has cut the breath to everyone because he plays his role in perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question, "Who is in the European Union?", "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards unity and greater legibility of Union policy in the face of the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our Syrecky (cooky pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that she has lived, lived and will live in the near future of the European Council.
She appointed the Czech Presidency two years ago to succeed.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity beat its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
In addition, the Union's new seventh budget must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and cost-effective, which sector will have priority, which countries will be most helped, at least everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
Mrs. Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make Syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative rather than positively.
She is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
In her view, the fault results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this French man says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?" and he's not quite happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, these are tough new budgetary policy rules that the Member States are waiting for.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at multiple speeds, that prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution for enhanced cooperation."
First it was said that the countries that want it cooperate with each other and those that do not want it remain in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Mrs Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to identify the bases on which all themes having an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the voice that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the nearest would be the "long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the footprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years due to the fact that it remained faithful to its core values and however did not fear to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "has announced for the anniversary the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees such as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The society was at the beginning great in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a Virginia Rometty - which should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working with IBM for 30 years and is currently serving as Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the last few years has been doing what is called jamy, brainstorming online from what many future strategies and innovations have come from.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that assures it a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than an institution than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called to the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is, of course, the most versatile technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, consulting services at the level of the server's products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technological firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
It is not all innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example has failed to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, online Prodige service or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can't emotionally stay hanged on the past," observed Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 she was with more than the strongest hardware representative.
From 2000 IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of potential technologies.
It continues in investment and even since 2008, when for the first time it has overcome the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Is it now apparent that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has increased from 2008 as a 120 percent rocket, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
It can be expected that this flexible giant will control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and initially had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history was linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the company's founder a shadow - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of society have so far been based.
Watson led the Kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to register boxes.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the turnover increased to as much as $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management, his son occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers at IBM helped NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In the meantime in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and management of cities.
As far as IBM's business is concerned, it has recently developed a "Smarter Trade" platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central European Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague, and there is also the global research and development team that deals with the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that ass, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After Joseph Rychtar's husband (53 years old) became a bodyguard and a lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only it could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not have to.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying good-bye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has left her husband alone but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to her is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"Society continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you as well?
If you ask men to determine women's typical vices, all of them, like each other, are able to get 'em out of their sleeve.'
My dear ladies, you will meet in the following lines the female vices who arrive to pump the blood of men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half comment that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about buying as a vice.
Some women feel that they should restrict their passion to making purchases.
But you will say, which would resist the window-leave of the clothing stores, to look for for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although most women buy is a hobby, it can become for man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your mate that he's waiting at the entrance...
Unsatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore one of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop dealing with yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and that women become poisonous.
The smell and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, peel the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on his own floor, to the children that they dirty the sink, nailed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of escape
"Put this worn overcoat into the garbage."
"Are you going to put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much work to save...
Defamation, persiflation
Defamation, persiflation, but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and are happy to deal with such topics as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets us escape a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persifle, even despise others and are around them - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
The hockey striker Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again leading productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made an extra pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Once this feeling falls upon you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to the Butor Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, followed by Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best league player but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline did a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty shot she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that end up two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the lead of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It's the fact that the back line was sick that mainly upset the local coach rather than lost fists because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's the way it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and victory over Tampu Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the goals of the Jets, who arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed travel mainly in the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however, it was necessary to tail all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it had not yet been won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where therefore there were many country houses and chalets that the Czechs were buying and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989 Czech travel has been a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs spent 4 million vacations last year abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are unaware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in neighbouring western countries has caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by aircraft to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations put Czechs to sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with itself his own food canned, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the exchangeability of the Czech krona, which finally allowed our tourists after decades of free purchasing power from the Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased which has led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to an increasing demand for travel travel agencies began in 1997 to prepare tours with air charter links which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was previously.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EUs that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year and every year direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU deleted visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 krona per person for vacation abroad, including the related charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but it may end with a situation without a "pat" solution.
Almost 5 months ago Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic's Football Association will not be known after yet another General Assembly that will take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be passed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure he called his colleagues together and found a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the time after Hasek the football went back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved completely on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
Delegates from the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and there was no question of how to handle the election.
There was no agreement on knowing who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only , as it were , the statutory representatives or also the staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still remain in relation to the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third lap not to fall into the bed.
"The difference apple lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round is that of the candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of voice from the two chambers.
And the Czech side studies the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two earlier turns and would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and believed that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even though he believes that the election rules established according to the Pelta's most advantageous status of all candidates.
"I wish that we should vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"In order for there to be still no savoury ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who, in his presentations, has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification in the European Championship today should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," added Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change the regulations to drawing."
"This can again cause a blockade in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that the good reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for agreement common to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgoric included Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and was looking for a variant to take part of the executive committee to the ground of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth and Sport Education Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports that must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidates.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of football had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT), he would not have been campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTC).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would previously be given favor for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he would win the elections he would hold this position as President until 2013 as planned for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but that is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me this was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be disturbing, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man who is known in the behinds as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta holds this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in listening to an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who once declared "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
In case Paclik won the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself for example as head of representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to run private companies and also has been leading Plzen's club since last year with his support last May his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring about a certain culture."
"I would stop the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, who does not look for his antipathy for Spartan Chief Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power to high-level policies would allow more money to be obtained from gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If this is about gambling tax, as stated by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he claims that the president of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass my shares from the Plzen club on to someone if I have to come back a year and a half after," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the EFRTA that should put an end to path situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that, if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes about the settlement for the elections.
Jablonec's grievor is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that the success of today's football representation should calm this fight before the vote.
Before the September election that did not take place, Pelta promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he added, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, worked for a large number of years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately in the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone saw it."
"If there weren't all these different interpretations, we'd have had a President since September," says Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am prepared to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he well knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had a few hits."
"But his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also for this reason that some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to his proclamations in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the Czech Press Agency CTK on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to head football would bring no change in people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he told Strahov where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote on the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader in its head," as Pelta said optimisticly two days before the probably decisive day for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people, he said.
However, Rajchl promises that in the event of his election we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the Executive Committee members responsible for the various football areas.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by Predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member deals with a specific field."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He pointed out, it was said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said to me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great job of fact and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them."He expressed with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
" Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"You can blame me for a number of things, but surely you can't bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other by which the winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," Rajchl said, considering among its future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiation of contracts with television and the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he has done a wonderful job this year."
"If he was elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek began and would not make any significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Pataugeores in optics of ovni, magnificent pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having toured the city or made a long walk- can let his feet rest tired in baths of gaseous water.
A book shows in which swimming pool we can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the past 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cups, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and could not help but admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain".Münich's covered swimming pools, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
It has led its "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Along with Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that swimmers should just look at blue tiles and settle down from the Javel water burner while joggers breathe perfume from spice forests or can listen to the park's happy birds.
"I wondered one day why the pools must in fact be always if ugly" said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface doubles architecture
A dive into a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, Meder says.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces appear optically in a double way: high vaults, multi-colour tiles, trampling.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The Collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the Karst (caver bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath with water filled with alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath has the whole city with its eyes, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of the water of Javel does not emanate from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a sulfur smell, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscaba emanates from a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, from a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor pool of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded land.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking through the window of the Art New building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
It observed a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style maure room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to merge construction styles so different in such a formidable unit," Meder said.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to have the consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuate this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign actually aligns itself with the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, the majority of experts share the opinion that betters have taken advantage of the offers and asked - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of the American competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No matter is worth putting in place the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is currently reviewing the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "Speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent today's banks are harmful to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly required today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about the hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group's CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculations.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One in two would terminate the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires for 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also benefit from the personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the termination of their account to change banking institutions.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the World Exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell to ruins.
Now it is opened again and is home for exhibition.
If you are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold look and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was previously awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following universal Austrian exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern Vienna station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly depleted.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance shot at every point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in his youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has led in particular to the transformation of political men and the protection of monuments, she has obtained and established private public funds and sponsorship.
Except contemporary art, works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a library are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "mostly every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his journey to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffre in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal deck beams have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a light panel swept between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Schwanzer Pavillon.
The exterior doors of origin remained, the house is painted in a shade against red-brown rust.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Several materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also enjoy the protection office monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if this is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is precisely the newly planned "central station neighborhood" with offices and apartments.
And another chance may occur: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid winter train accidents.
The number of employees should double.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million extra this year in this regard.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of approximately EUR 300 million would be expected by 2015.
This should make it possible for vehicles and rail networks to be more readily available in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the blackout of railway and dock facilities is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear snow and ice pellets until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Rüdiger Grube Station Chief warned the government and industry at a summit conference on train accidents that also took place this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reservations in the event of difficult weather conditions.
As a result, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had for years what to do, since it has to check the axles of the ICE trains more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is another case in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant sector is catching it in addition to the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute due to the failure of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator makes a whole series of accusations to large banks, which would have prompted cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
In comparison, the Bank has recognized no fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damages incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large separate banks and in the summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at the moment it is blowing on the American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies to obtain redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 large international banks, the two American state real estate financier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in-kind in mortgage cases of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, with several transactions of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, American major investor Warren Buffett has constantly explained that he does not invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already to be understood much earlier than IBM offers mainly services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's attack in the finance world.
Therefore, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to call itself "Mr. IBM".
Car Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic show that since March he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been put for some time on profit services IT as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, who is over 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting and very powerful business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
On the contrary, Buffett is dealing with the railway mill, lubricant or machinery manufacturers.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has almost 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenary had resumed in the 1960s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and erected it to one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investment.
However, its lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent in the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the spectre that was thought to have been dead for a long time re-appeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right extremist context against the Turks.
However, there is never a question of xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the extreme-right burrow.
It was in a reasonable way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a 50th anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of certain Turkish media make the effect of a gif: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the unique conditions.
"It begins to dawn", Tel is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He pointed out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
Police action was perceived in a very critical manner on the German-Turkish forums and later discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in certain suspected extreme right circles, the authors are amazed.
More than one shows himself ready to at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be framed, it will remain to migrants only self-defense and armament".
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what mistrust and distance through acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish Head of State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks has been with the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and re-evaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has nearly failed in the financial and skate crisis in the meantime from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July, that in 2013 it would occupy an almost as spectacular position: President of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, and welcomed Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and expressed kind comments on future colleagues.
The U.S.B.S. has made it to the Turnaround.
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, since September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had burned about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
from the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber come back at last?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more economic professor and bank president, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All of a sudden, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
Indeed, the UBS is on a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the Swiss bank so proud.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a long-term bank teacher in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we wonder, how could I just have been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retired surprisingly, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later it was felt for what reason he was gone.
The division of the bank had burst with sub-prime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have squeezed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian background from Singapore and an Arab background, which was silent, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
However, this was only the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses to billions, and the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second most well-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster continued: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank has redeemed the UBS from tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become the bank's co-owner.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter so large banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We haven't been able to save the UBS once again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and had declared itself ready to publish easy customer data, which might have cheated the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unwarranted profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
Following the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, in a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calmness, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single merchant of title torched 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized anything but turned round.
And it is published: with risk management in investment bank this still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it was found that the control of risks has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
Also the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich is still going to match with the Swiss private bank's solid cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's is found here in Swiss tradition stores as well as in the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a big label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other out of the market - or betrayed the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, he found - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxons' moods."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the shock: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster appeared on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country to seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has constantly recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different pre-decessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but indeed already more heavily internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has gone a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remember the leaders' meetings at which the Wuffli group leader always issued the same order: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the U.S.S. wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The business advisers, who were responsible for this, however, highlighted a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
The bank itself as well as a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed the value documents based on US mortgages - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The bigger the euphoria the more the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts was more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far become benches.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (yet) to go that far.
But the investment bank must be vigorously atrophied, just as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: he had to conduct long-term UBS affairs, reported on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
He's cancelling 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly until now only that he was going to pick up an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged US investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The industrial production jugulated on the continent has stifled the hopes of a stabilisation of the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I still had only half-filled last week, not half-empty - but now the problems are rushing back to the front again, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Most of the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The Dow-Jones-Index defaults indicated a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12,078 points at the closing of the markets.
During trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index taken more broadly at 1251 points, a deficit of 1%
Nasdaq, the index of the technology grant lost 0.8%, and ended up with 2657 market points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced its production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Office, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the previous month.
American investors expressed in a sceptical way: "We are not an island, however dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there are also other signs of weakness from banks.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett merely confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in obligations coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of over ten billion dollars to IBM supported the course of this traditional group's actions, and made it worth almost 1% against the trend of commercial management.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares have yielded to 2.6 per cent, significantly higher than the market.
The house invested almost all the rest of its shares in the 'China Construction Bank' (China Construction Bank) and took $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to maintain with the company's net profit, in particular its capital ratio and therefore meet the most difficult regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft increased its business and therefore limited the losses in the Dow.
The shares won 1.5°% after the company collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airline ordered on Sunday 50 long-distance aircraft of type 777 and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 additional machines, the volume is still up to $26 billion.

719 values increased, 2281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
On Nasdaq, the turnover closed to 1.38 billion shares with more than 630, a minus of 1913 and 82 unchanged.
Smart cornellas spread in cities
In many places, chills are considered as "bird problem°" But experts claim that these very intelligent animals no longer allow themselves to hunt cities for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The cornellas belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of animal dirt and noise.
An antidote against the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the cornellas, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt down the rubble of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected colds: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, planning and slaughtering typical cucumber trees made life difficult for birds.
The cornellas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cove couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity as a result of the massacre of the cornellas in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the decay, is useless," observed Leer's city planner and landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often produces adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr to Bade-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the big colonies split up, and they disperse elsewhere."
The evence is imaginable only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer's opinion.
Conceivable is a combination of animal thinning with a perverse conditioning and tight offers, in order to allow them to reinstall elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens envisioned "info panels instead of slicers" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-road-educational of the baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent fries.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "Here is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Frequents not only use tools of work to reach a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as tools of work.
Ethologists at Cambridge University tested four fries recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds occurs.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to have a squabbling with stones to achieve a larvae.
Without much training, they strongly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning cornellas then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their goal with their beak.
However, the researchers had made available pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks were unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Directed by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal turned against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the game back eliminatory by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been a clear thing.
There was also no more burning in the 0:0 nil match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 off (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11 meters-penality played by the hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance in the jersey.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remotely shot qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headball directed down the cross-bar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek has a goal for Czech
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding is at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Centraleo that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the European vice-champion in 2004 succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st CF Nuremberg), also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Butt guard Petr Cech has prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potentials (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Cech fire.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the help of the world-class warden of the Czechs who had already been shot down, again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink was also due to abandon his seat on the 2002 EM third-party bench, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the lieutenants of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, Ireland celebrates its first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already successfully supported 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence has been able to prevent a possible goal of the first buster.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, aims to invest billions in China in the coming years and will double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world's corporate software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has had a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our objective is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal masses
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. It's entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" and begins with a long list of characters that embrace your heart.
A tip to start: tear this page carefully and make it your brand-page.
In this novel account by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the mist of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary which he accurately described as "an anti-history work."
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and equipment is found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like."There are the "feels, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young students and botanists to climbers, passing by doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, get mad or lose their lives.
Their lives wobble here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, there are new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
He made a denial of the idea that World War I was only summed up by the terrible trenches war on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are in bedside noises; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; tset-tsé flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of such people as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who can the corditous.
When gunshots hit far away, and that you're a mother at home, are you staying or running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Coffee replacement, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own propulsion to the savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a handy whisky, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no beard behind your worn and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are reappointed to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's rather comparable to "a man convicted secretly strangled."
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the beginning of the century: the killer of well-articulated mass and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butcher's shop while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and lie on the genital organs in hopes of ending the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not obstentatory, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped the way in which the war "deceased exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People start to wonder why their leaders make them a war.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "Western Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most devastating that I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seize this page where the list of people appears and burned with an allumette.
After a first false step, a thoroughly planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the beginning of the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges facing the Police Department.
There could not be any repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the regulation of the department and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police officers had prepared themselves by observing the progress of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist of rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders given to move in the park came "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person under an anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, so the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from around the neighborhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had fewer people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages heard from speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue windbrokers, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 a.m. said the Police, which allowed occupants time to collect their business.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if any arrests were necessary.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the Chief of the Police Department, stated that this measure was taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, which was carefully detained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the trucks of television cameras on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
While the Police were moving west across the thick business search of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of leaves filled with clothing, teams in the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp hanged together.
Finally, two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "problem to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to be found on site.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricadas were placed on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the top of a police car. Others were seen cracking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a tip of plywood emerged by flying the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
School Aid Union continues the city for redundancies
The union, representing hundreds of school aids lost their jobs last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged students.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the redundancies.
Six hundred and sixty-twelve school grants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs last October 7th. The union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not leaving the city to have access to a health care fund led by the working groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott stated that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that school leave was not specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers stated that they would complete a notice of complaint warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution of the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers, all of whom are black or of Latin American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union would focus on the number of layoffs in the city's most disadvantaged schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most support due to regular under-financing.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each less-favoured student registration.
The union also claims that high school directors could be misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtaking" to describe the action, although "overtaking" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "sixty parent coordinators have been fired," and "not only because of overrun."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of lifting in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gadhafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission has therefore remained in the form of legislative purgatory - the Congress opposed enough to criticise Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "he congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "he congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or divide legislators as last June?
The Senator and Chair of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or in the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations in a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to wish their CVs - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is always proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the states are opposed.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slows down from the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not battue" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and said he wanted to get back first instead of going back to Congress.
During his appearance in the 20/20 television newspaper on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, aged 41, answered "pretty well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special 20/20 hour edition, broadcast the day before the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "Quoi."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said he doesn't remember shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she first stopped her and requested information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"Then I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and come back even harder than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock played a ball about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-clothes stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund-raising.
A military high-grade at the gala, also attended by admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," wrote the military high school in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just compassion.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public acts increasingly as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognized or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who put him through the interviews would ask in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you discuss the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct advantage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer cherish heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faced with increasing pressure to fight rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The 1st-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, grounded and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the court ruling during a historic trial to take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether a trial will take place against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rapes within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number was 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking it to the gallonized soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?"
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future prosecutions.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants" the documents indicate.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have the official right to go to combat, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as well as Afghanistan, women's soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two - thirds in a fighting situation.
It's time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are under way in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for having said to encourage a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of " personality problems" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (the Women's Action Network), a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police about rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was gonna start having contracts, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remembered saying to my commander, "This was not his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether or not the Lyman case and other complainants will go ahead, it's a long story, says John Turley, law professor at the University of Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and dissuasive means of accountability.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he says.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged to have been taken from a deadly madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent a great deal of time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an inquiry. Questions related to their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose name appears in the title of the site by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students talking on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chances of being alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Institute for Children's Research in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also consistently adheres to the information of its users.
The website's data team has studied statistics on the situation of love and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (through information only available - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make available its data treasure to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": First appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he said in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I regret it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in hopes of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing with a view to seeing the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally went a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may help some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's relative.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview and will be broadcast this week in part of a film on the main markets, is how much that creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an enhancer of organization charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "disease allowing them to think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Cringey developed the TV series "Triph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the interview with Crengely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly up, is the base of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who knows to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiastic about exhibiting technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism re-awakened, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringley's questions, giving him elbows to speed it up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strange aspect prescient about Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers to be good or bad at other companies and shares his own vision about the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by providing details on his efforts to simplify accounts for Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and telephone free of charge in long-distance.
The device has been the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it came a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much either, but we were able to invent a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever exist without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are laughing crazy just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with the technology (and get rid of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the yearbook and gave him a wire shot.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees were treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head shot.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he must take care of assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... they yelled at me claiming it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety-ten days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are blowing up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyer or better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] end up leading companies and product specialist staff are excluded from decision-making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done her current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just proved themselves the best IT scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for IT science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents while the court meets
The day when the Supreme Court met in private to examine the question of political disagreement, namely whether opposition to President Obama's Health Act will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm who will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held on Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned a trial by 26 States challenging the reform of ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March next, and the outcome will probably be in a position to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer to be held before the court and will argue the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the general solicitor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society (Federalist Society) dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and stated opponent of the Health Act.
Guest star at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend the collection of funds from legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be an intervener, guest of honour, or on the program of such an event".
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers' offices of the case, as well as a firm with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules as all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
The Conservatives also claim that Judge Elena Kagan has an ethical issue, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line planes
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way planes, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated at over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a matter when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Also amazing is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine rising from future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published Monday, Chicago's company estimates that Middle East airlines will need $2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-courses.
The Dubai-based Emirates airline passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing reported on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
These six devices amount to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular are of immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates's command reinforces Boeing's predominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps to slow down the attempt to impile the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautics fair comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its beginnings to increase its drive following its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister clearly beats the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped her rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the run to the position of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoacán's governorship during violent elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the race at the position of governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral officers... they took ballots, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was in charge of the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently in the role of governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the Presidentials of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to assist the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Manila-based BASD, stated that the two economic powers with the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "apathetic eye" and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it's not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has been dangerously increased and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused fear that the world economy will go back to recession, and has prompted major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a cut in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to accept European aid to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and leave on a holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "loss risks" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakage.
Strong Warnings from the Pentagon on Potential Reductions of Defence
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would save national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction of the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, passing through the civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already up to $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but fears now that an additional amount of $600 or more compressions will be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a resulting budgetary agreement in what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied so without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects inoperable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing of foreign contingency accounts in time of war is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to the war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The result of a kidnapping of the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed world leader of the military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators stated in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and the recent warnings of senators increase pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about the possible compressions, even though he himself reached the highest position in the Pentagon that accumulated years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could pass to the coupe, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy.
Ending the F35 development and testing could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say this is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the Herman Cain presidency is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of cheating for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone stating to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Celebrity Anthony Weiner, went on to be an idiot by quickly issuing misconceptions contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of funding campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of the people who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton set out in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave test responses to students to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions are we meeting?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't shake, rust or they don't always shake.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of answer.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they tell tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmarks".
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him tow his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behaviors.
Consider these indices as red flags, no evidence of deception.
Deceitful people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet at the door, look at an exit, change posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - a exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, be careful about your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson took off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceitful individuals can also use a remote language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat completely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" in their answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual rather than factual response and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances for anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking the anger of trade unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on the tracks.
TransCanada stated Monday night that it will move the pipeline projected out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official Alex Pourbax asserts that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and Ogallala, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State is likely to have pushed any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 70,000 barrels per day from Alberta province to Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have placed over the estimated 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But Nebraska's legislators opposed to this plan press that a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
While the Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, the energy industry stated that the department's general inspector ordered a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor at Hilary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a detachment of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point where she threw up in fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk to such an extent that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," says her family during the Supreme Court of Manhattan's trial.
It was November 10 last year while stage technician Kevin Monk, her kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to their building in Riverside boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter up for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "what you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and started using jurors - the word "" and the word """ of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," says the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surrounding who brought her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud she threw herself up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but did not get any answers.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims for unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother's teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has curbed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advancement of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing loss of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report on the allocations by frosts from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in State unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of State unemployment during the first three quarters of the year has been seen, since from January to March 55 thousand 053 signalees were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, an increase of more than 74 thousand unemployed signalees, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty to find work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment increase," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the signal labour market is worsening in view of the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state is working there without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for discontinuing the state is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, the highest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 thousand,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143 thousand,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State in July requested approval of a 3-billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600-billion-weighted and no debt in any sector of the State economy was observed until November.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and above all the good already synchronized progress of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as frosts from the beginning of the year retained the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patron Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas of economic development, there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are some things that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's Public Prosecutor's Office has informed that the convicted small smuggler is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, in his alternative possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was circulating in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and in the copilot's place a small backpack on the back where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to works
Social works in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the work, so there is a possibility of delay in its completion.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a share," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to function, and this year we, in order to access these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had applied to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrive as quickly as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
The Court valid "the analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals by digital means is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has raised the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue coupura" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it have not been held.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was halted for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and statutory reserve.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies in order to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also resolved to lift the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected if it were done," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of state management.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and this results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To adjourn the change, he said, would adjourn the benefits of digitisation which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of a whole system to establish, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the power of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite having the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competences of Congress, as it assures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assures.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote account in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of "voting by vote" is a reality with regard to the election trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards in the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits provided for in the Act of the Official Journal of the State, arguing that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State's representative for constitutional reforms, since it does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal stated that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council, it will be possible to achieve the partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the ballot file is not in the Chair of the ballot; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of votes received in all polls of the election may be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates indicated.
The total polling may also take place if at the end of the joint counting it follows that the difference between the alleged successful candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the political party representative whose second date the candidate was released, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be spread in the Sierra Zapalinamé, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday at night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a package.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant-Colonel was that his ashes should be spread in the Sierra Zapalinamé.

Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo to register at the Collège de l'Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even in trouble with the truck, but he always followed his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as this was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagón to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours it was said to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that led Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.

Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadreyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found to be shot with shots fired in different parts of the body and with the blow of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose closing has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread out over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered elsewhere, because no trace was found in situ.
In the closure of the property there were legends directed by a group of organized crime to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadreyta

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of the economic disaster.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his discussions with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "framework is now well drawn", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a time shorter than usual, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to move forward, the instability of the markets to place the yield of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good outcome," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Center-Right Party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of the technocratic majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government in Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the forthcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process that is forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and party disagreement complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's part, only one of the 22 participants participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's amical, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a large record of Class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain an intense activity in national league and coup championships and fights in European Cups such as the League Champions.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concaf, which is considered at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guard Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain wheel of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other hundred years of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the buster Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have passed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
The historic bust of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also become a dream to happen in that country.
It was the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades of work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcription of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far this has been great.
I spent only once on vacation in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and sorry for the fact that so much time had to go to this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places for surfing; this is how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you've offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that supposed to be?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock band, and the fact that we did it for over 20 years made it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell about our blessings and we are deeply moved by the fact that we can continue to make music together.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group comes from a city, but it's far more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that popped up.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about the others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really matter to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and did not publish a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of frustrations about the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose it for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
First of all, I remember Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunt in spite of the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
This is interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, they probably represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, he informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of restitution for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulating problems in the feet, listed the physician.
Fujimori has been serving prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron who performed clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political links
An official cortex, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador of that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to hasten the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustard lead passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiring, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the cracks of the bad Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to make good use of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game in Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of the existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not been happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the saga's followers and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustach lead must go through rigged platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
So the trial is over for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term "he had not helped" in no judicial resolution and had given lessons to all extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former 2004-2004 agent.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for misappropriation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the long-term number of jobs currently obtained by this social group is added.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping the untrained, jobless people, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Councillor Richard Goma attended the event.
The current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Charity Director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also assisted in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the present one is also very difficult, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to be able to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived ended.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday to leave the building they were occupying illegally and where they were organizing micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From this day on, there will be access control," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass parties, which gave up to two days and desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building, her business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair competence, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment facility had to respond to neighbors' complaints for noise, while according to the latter, the troubles were not caused by the disco customers, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties held there, who were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The discotheque manager explained that the troubles were so great that she even made an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months since he "forgave" rent.
The Urban Guard (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The mayor's president of the PP group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common and civil life problems that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The People's Leader explained that prior to the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the Squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Yesterday too, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 a.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral, number 35, after having received a call from a neighbor who had observed that four persons were entering the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy over honoraries
The municipal competition on 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed the posters for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large metropolitan Barcelona park.
In addition, it also contained a figures comparison with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park if not Yellowstone, with straps in the role of Yogi bears.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of the park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of elites speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves, coincidentally.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modal and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green house pâtés, was not completed.
"We must start from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict to the architect for which the title of "Collserola ports" contains a "lexic trap": they should not be thought of as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his song of swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limitating something means already establishing the next step," i.e., its overrun.
"We have to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
With greater emphasis on the question, Modal believes that, by simplifying, the side of the El Valles de Collserola region "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modal recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not be lost", thanking the mayor for the opportunity that the corporation offers to intervene in this project "for the first time".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he said) that one must create: "We architects should only be an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the bases of the competition are missing a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-cutting contests - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that runs through and understands the area as a whole".
This makes, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In other words, a project so that one of the doors could crash into the program and define it with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that performs a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonás Larrazábal and will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red's legal basis granted forgiveness to the Mayor's brother Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Red Casino grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Royal Casino attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that Monterrey Mayor allows the clandestine operation of the gaming house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor's brother and on September 2, he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second warrant of detention after the Public Prosecutor's agent had lifted the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for having the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos of the gambling house representatives in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and whose gambling partners had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Pursuant to file 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently, no claim may be filed for the proceedings brought against him; no compensation and no punishment shall be sought.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the playhouse, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the San Nicolás de los Garza Town Hall to report to Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives, indicated that the helicopter was directly shocked against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contact with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements for carrying the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter was operating at a speed of crossing and this happened on a moving ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation crossing at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The IACM reports mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the borderline area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-level layers of nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the conditions of nebulosity, the crew sought a lower height and more visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar recording of the aircraft coincide, probably prior to the impact there has been no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model allows for the assumption that the helicopter has hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No trace of fire or explosion was detected:
In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the aircraft remains of an explosion or fire type.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple ground contact.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol on Obesity of Children and Adolescents', which will allow them to have markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The survey invites the population with or without rights to participate, to attend the IMSS sports units in Valle de México, where evidence is made to minors every Saturday starting at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Unit Sportive Cuauhtémoc (State of West Mexico) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Unit Sportive Nezahualcóyolt (State of East Mexico).
After achieving the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence (south of Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research and that it is aware of the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of inherited diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (required to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years, in the case of boys, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase', emphasized the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for searching markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from the other by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent European and five per cent African inheritance, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that obesity genetics generally result in the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the likelihood of metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential way, doctors send it in writing to parents, each explaining the measures and changes in the lifestyle they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates of carbon (tamales - meat pasta of corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetic analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid the cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signs that the pavement was solved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on the cases, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, adds it.
This means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he said, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass it by generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one puts a final layer called the bearing layer, made of fine stone, i.e., sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since it is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the case of the formation of a case, he said, the first one that gets wasted is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The Member of the National Research System explained that vehicle load is another important factor in case formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent case formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did it miss for the Valle candidate to be the new Colombia miss?
Analysis of the factors that have caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for finding herself on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already 14 titles of Princesse and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint the First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? put forward by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince" is a fairly profound book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardour of Blood".
This answer did not please first of all because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book quoted marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions put forward is the hypothesis that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage".
And it was noted in his first presentation as a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the day before the coronation.
Although she had appeared confident of herself at the two parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" (Comme à la casa), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina had been appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For this reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a committed woman with regard to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough at a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition you are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned because of her back defects and fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The preparation of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had no better body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality had not been too well-known to me, left her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believed that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body has never been his asset and she has lost because of this."
For this prize, which the National Competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the bathing jersey parade came up a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscope has passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these staff members is crucial.
On November 4th, a California CTI dactyloscope passed on to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Seven dactyloscopes working in the local offices of the ITC this week were the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because this one was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, with no glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, picker and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farcs.
In search of the fingerprint
For a Dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, the dactyloscopes support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint of them, but in this case we have been able to get the footprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
Fingerprints may also discard or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
We recently found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Even if it does not guarantee that he is the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
One ITC dactyloscope explained that "digital fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to remove them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of the decliners, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show it in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines isn't gold, everything that you touch doesn't become forced into a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indignities" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people went to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a court order, in Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allowed the 'indignados' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignities" to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the camp and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignados' occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which united New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, ensuring that he had seen some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some demonstrators so far carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and even handed it over to the officers who monitored the place, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to demonstrators, to whom, however, he warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to harm other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they do not think of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", assistant in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian TV Christmas.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (balladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st performing a very special Virgin Marie.
CTV now distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented part of Charlie Sheen's My Violent Torpedo of Truth, appeared like Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the CTV's special program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan surrendered after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% through domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, convalescent again after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The Government of Tokyo's first estimates calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unabated increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the shortcomings for zero cross.
Japan has woken up mainly as a result of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugeal values" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and the disturbing forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their weak results between July and September for the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue to sit in EU peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower custody.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being braked.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, not lowering eight decimal points up to 99.13 points.
Athens feed doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get into the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Swiss Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by the genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not express any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenis parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen points out Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a dominant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation, which "the essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and "very specially, in the one whose purpose is to reduce the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which the "soil of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs of the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "acquired a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be pursued.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families come from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him the "family head" he met in Valladolid yesterday on the part of the "poor banker".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credits imply "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
Soraya Rodriguez, Secretary of State for International Cooperation, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluding the door to which everyone closes"; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes that the European President be elected by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democrat party.
Europe's future was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it was imposed in the fall, particularly in order to satisfy the militants who consider the government's policy to be too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps to Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their speeches, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European minister of finance, left no doubt.
The idea of the chancellor - and the motion - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon which would strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the motions adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Indeed, the Twenty-Sevens are unlikely to agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the stake is set.
Likewise, delegates rejected a overwhelming majority of the proposal to put the weight of each country to the European Central Bank's Director based on the weight of each economy, which obviously strengthened Germany's weight.
In order to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not also sought to win her congress on the back of the "little" European countries or countries in difficulty ready to criticize arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollows.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does the fraud at medical arrests represent?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the disease arrest offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on - recurring since 2007 - the fight against social fraud and assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a announcer of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on the disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government is planning to impose a fourth day of shortage on private employees prior to a stopover.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but which would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-indemnity on officials in the event of termination of work (they have so far no time limit of deficiency, compared to three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the topic of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," warned Xavier Bertrand at the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
It has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sicker than they are in Europe.
Let us first look at national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of Health Economic Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
So 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of stopping work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain gaps: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management Site, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days to stop illness.
Another study, this time of Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the sick sentences were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A lengthy study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick arrests represents very little in the face of black labour.
In terms of fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on medical arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% "unadapted or unwarranted" cases of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases of several million employees who had a sick stay.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, to that of black labour.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax deficit per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament said on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos planned that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's MPs, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the EUR 8 billion loan needed without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to that end.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts have participated in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the federal government's position, which has already said that they want nothing to change to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, he claimed yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, the pollers estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations about the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described as "extreme" the position of the experts signing the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help with suicide," says Me Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the person's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands or Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a "combat"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Bachar al-Assad supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry's premises.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "combat" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours to Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "outtake power" in Syria where about forty civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a Syrian-neighbourly country, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the leader of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year under the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed a "enforcement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces perished in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (SHR).
Two other civilians died "on the exchange of gunfire and heavy machine guns at Jobar" in the besieged town of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem felt that the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he felt was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not weaken," he added, ensuring that "the horrid plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is confined to the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in conflict and liberation of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday found the Arab League's decision "inaccurate", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers.
It should put in place a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of Parliament for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting the President of the Council appointed.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to call for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, probably of about a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonds yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister appointed should be a team that includes mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself, once he came into office, to work in the emergency and for the purpose that Italy "become the protagonist" in Europe.
A European Commissioner Olli Rehn spokesperson stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, further stringent measures.
The Italian patron saint Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and another "Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place by April 2012 EUR 200 billion of state bonds.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" about the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, widely based in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has decreased slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent, against a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," noted the human rights organization Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he said, believing that this could happen by improving police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is an legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service somewhat more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly, on-line the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens that follow the messages ("tweets") and those that follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the entire network Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its low instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to recast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend follow another user) making the happiness of the initiators, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users discussed "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too Facebook," @jemb123 writes.
"Activity functionality will help me to follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
inclusion of a "gold rule" budget in the constitution
The government of the great Social-Democratic/Democrat-Christian coalition in Austria decided Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits so as to avoid possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (Triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% maximum criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was lowered by only one skull, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest in addition each year," said the Deputy Chancellor and Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area member countries on 26 October last: the Heads of State or Government had then claimed the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are close to the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to put public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Strong Yen
The threat of a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate," explained Mr.Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 in front of the green note.
But the yen has been regularly raised since, dominated by purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is spent Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has fallen under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that have triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This sharpness of the Japanese currency was detrimental to the archipelago's exports because it cost the products Made in Japan and reduced the value of revenues from outside Japan's companies when they converted them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge in the exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the yen's charity did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relief was to be expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion (€47 billion) to $55,000 billion (€519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates are climbing, the scholarships are flanking
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis always undermines the European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions over the performance of euro area Member States' borrowings in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a corridor of narrow variations as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," Mitsushige Akino said, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, in full of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates for Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian bonds at 10 years of age reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities at the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has claimed time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the target line of markets, while there are Sunday legislative elections in the country.
The spread rate gap between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new history.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
As far as statistics are concerned, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than 0.3% expected, resulting from household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, indeed, it is the fourth one who is most concerned by economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 am, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it on the dogmas
If it is a matter that cannot be dealt with on short-term or emotional grounds, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear has in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to offset the re-refaction of fossil resources in order to continue to produce permanent electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a matter that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
It is not the case with Belgium, which submits itself to the need to be able to find a replacement source, or Switzerland, which simply intends to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but one, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a interrupted power plant after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all of these ugly effects have already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
The European Wind Champion, of which he draws 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; hence, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a electricity bill of more than 40% to that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, as long as they do not manifest a fundamental opposition to this energy, surveys show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has created an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exportable, it leads to a galaxy of specialised SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative of non-replaceable jobs.
If France had just decided to get out of nuclear power, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing as a sad skin the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to work sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, no more than there is no evil.
The development by Areva of low-emitting CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power stations as on the site of Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same safety obsession.
In a half century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, has intervened under normal operating conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the stopping of its construction in Flamenville would be a beautiful gift offered to competitors in Areva and EDF by leaving them the free path to take leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in a variety of ways - in which police, judicial and administrative services are subject to the policy of the figure, which is compatible with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (lire Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country of nearly 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish lead was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be denied to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is confined to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps electorally paid; but it is very expensive economically.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting anemic immigration to growth and a loss of employment.
The concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, especially those who are underqualified, with lower pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, most of whom work in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetics, these complementaritys between nationals and migrants make immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalised immigrants among the Nobel American prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution (less-expenditure revenue) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, which were used to deter immigrants, had the exact reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to be seen as European democracy.
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be enough, so that democracy would permanently triumph over its enemies, to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
It is known from Napoleon "the Little One", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and may even become "enstrument of oppression" as once said by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis in politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum has in this respect had a double value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved away, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers no longer pull in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump attached in the vacuum of the nationalist replica: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutlery, but we do want a common exercise, full, peaceful and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there would be no place to stop the list - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that leans on the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
Europe as a whole is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the piloting of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Eight.
But thinking about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"without contact" smart cards are generally used.
The world exhibition of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end by an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card telephone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to make further progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the overall smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long past the Asian-Pacific region, Europe gains land for non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double plugs.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically broadcast cards to their customers for contact-free," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
The CPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The survey on the abduction of two French in Niger last January would have brought to light the gateways.
Kidnapped to a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the disaster of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls is aimed at several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's an advance but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," Temperes Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and of the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of illuminators of little interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic mirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the Sharia while its activists engage in the fight against the impie central government.
The first are churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on the police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Hence the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was still in Abuja, where he was taken to the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the declarations and shortenings of foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - merge.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Great Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme in America exacerbated by the migration of whole fish from their industry to Asia.
So much so if it must involve the triggering of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama China and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, standing in the depths of the polls, remains audible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, did he brag?"
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge about the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware that China has owned the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The current president's opponents replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the early departure of Iraq's "boys", on its twistings in Libya, thus attaching a weak label to it.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security assessment, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of the military interventions that lead to the rape.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to raise its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with splendour.
Over 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly links Russia under the sea to Germany.
The German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte played together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first 1.224 km tube connecting the Saint Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Land.
A second tube is due to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, i.e. equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has airs of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," confirmed François Fillon by opening this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from ship anchorages.
It is based on the seabed, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines dating from World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for the Northern Stream company.
Measures to protect fauna and flora also had to be multiplied.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts on its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was provided for outside Sweden, but the project managers gave up while the Swedishs were reluctant to see a Russian state company standing permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop passing the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leak, therefore, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned welding to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline shall be carried out by an underwater robot, driven by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft circulating within the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to be repaired.
The flow of gas is simply assured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the beginning, and 100 on the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture, known as Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company, for 20 renewable years, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that happens, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskin Book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet, the Moleskine Book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (taupe skin) which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, as the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, with 12 employees at its beginning, accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to the small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... The brand is spread over a wide range of media.
A success that has made a huge difference: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was redeemed by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of people with disabilities is opening today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, he points out Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done. "
It has to be said that for the disabled, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% are older than 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment, and which "constitute the knot of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
It remains the unspoken, the attitudes that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepriser Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, show a 2.6% ratio.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also translates true awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How Happy."
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
Not until we write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," Lillois says on his side.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, if it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Threatened against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
However, without forgetting the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he says.
This must contribute to further strengthening the "particular" nature of this meeting.
As far as he is concerned, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We've come across in the hour."
"You can play against them, it's only happiness!"
With bonhomy, Leekens has for his part referred to "fertility".
"Ferty" to fight "a gala match."
"Reliance" also to see - as a "neighbor" - that France has become "a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a tonner job," he was enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself sharing the plane with the Blue Directions... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with many optimistic its dam back in front of Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had failed to achieve realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which has been in handcuffs since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to launch.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we haven't set a goal outside."
But at their home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even though the part is obviously announced "very tight", said a bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take it over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance to be at the Euro 2012", still relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The unreported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It is a good result, however, that carries a certain risk because we have not set a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
