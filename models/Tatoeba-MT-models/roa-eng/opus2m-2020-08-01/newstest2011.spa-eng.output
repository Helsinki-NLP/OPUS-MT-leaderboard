What's up? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, as it seems, the clear language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed companions of the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The encoded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political nata during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm better off as a beginner in Prague politics," said during the "college" terminology examination by the cultural councilman Lukaš Kaucký.
As for the political veteran, Karel Březina also reacted.
Maybe they know the concept of golf today.
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all you've asked me that I use every once in a while."
"If not, usually not a slang job."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June prior to the ODS voting congress, the wording chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "nuca de toro", "ttraction of the capital" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't meddle in these things, and I don't think I'd appreciate how Democrats civics have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Lukaš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
In Kaucký the word "Voldemort" tells him nothing; the only term he right in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, who immediately adds, "but I know about the news."
"I'm going to have to aim for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the Council of Environment Lukáš Pictureý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukaš Imaginý really know where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it soon reveals to Imagý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don't have anything like that."
"Well, we use nicknames between us, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says ČSSD Praguensse President Petr Hulinský, whose matchmates call Hulda.
"In school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," says Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For their party comrades, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old man"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election cheated during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igràček" ("playmobil") from some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulinský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz has even discovered other nicknames for this president to preach.
"The doctor of the rights of bitches" seems to remember that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the “margins”, as published in a booklet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such a pain."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, occupies a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a handle.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warns the Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country in Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemma died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a miserable accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It was lit up when the group wanted to "exhale the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "margins" supports it people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur in Burkina Faso: "Human soul devourers have always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to calm the witch hunt, last year in Gambia the president was still involved in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a widespread witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and tried to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the personal escort of the president, were forced into force to randomly chosen men and women among the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kamalim," says Amnesty International in his report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a handful of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, about a thousand people were finally released.
The Bakala tenant: is heated with coal stoves and signs a higher rental
The elderly man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
All three have just caught the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "uncorrect and indecent", recommends to tenants who do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, the man only makes a skill set.
"Each one says something," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large testing laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG's mining waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava's and, Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number pickup machine.
"A Renter 2011" can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, you get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly marriage comes to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the lodges of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in rent between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November, a special window was opened at the customer service centre for the new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," they reply, after a brief doubt, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old flats for Bakala miners are the most sensitive topics in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, who originated from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralek, from ČSSD, had already treated them loud and clear, and now appear continuously in the papers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my fucking bathroom plate," the man mentioned in the introduction is unsubstantiated.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than nothing retired to check whether they receive a discount on rent if they sign in time, as promised by the special RPG offer.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rent in February of the remaining tenants signing the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dissipate the flood of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for rent in 2011 about forty-fifty people," the employee of the window estimates.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties do not reach agreement on rent, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way of proceeding possible and completely in accordance with the law," says RPG on its pages.
"There's no one to be judged here," says one of RPG Byy's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people are waiting," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the home portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7,50 Czech krones per month per square metre", is indicated on the screen.
It only increases by 38 per cent the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not impact rents, but will rise from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the chart) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to persons signing the rental upload agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with everything he owns at such facilities: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio came from many well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits Arch.Design your workers in the framework of your social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of their children.
The mini-guardia was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guardia is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the Czech State budget.
Thanks to the funding provided (more than 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to maintain the mini-guardia with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the request for funding contributed the Economy Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; moreover, a nurse and teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guardia", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guardian programme are comparable to the usual pre-school curriculum.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach up to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also has a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go and see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the sign companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The bone house continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch Gaudí interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and torsion of shapes continue to surprise us also inside.
The wavy wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signposts.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood in the number 43 of the lively commercial street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house in 1877 of architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on overthrowing the former building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of several apartments, did not design it by itself Antoni Gaudí.
In the design, architect Josep María Jujol collaborated.
In fact, in his plans of the project, ornaments appeared for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mila and the Park Güell de Gaudí, in which there are other pieces of it.
Because of its organic form, the premises soon after its completion called it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the boisterous."
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be surprising its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the rules of construction of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the outset, although the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were evidently so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city was so impacted with the result it requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather: just fifteen days after the city's application, Joseph Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, with six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, obtained not only a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and swallows.
The game with the two colors brings maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which instead absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house you will find the most spacious and more charged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and to the bohardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the dream are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be added to perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
Many elements, including weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner, come into play during the election.
Also important is the type of interior where the mattress and the somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep inside the moisture. Even the moho may appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and tougher surface.
"Almost all hockey players returning from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep here as well."
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they get bad information about the joints and the skin," Sylva Hadamcziková explains, who specializes in the covered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these right Tempur and Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player to be able to appreciate viscoelastics anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your rigidity and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastics also works as a protection against the ponds.
When choosing the mattress size, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, e.g. single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit to be also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you fall face up, you should have your hands lined comfortably towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu čalouník to dekorater, who has been dealing for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, a subject that teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own sleep and mattress, so during the purchase you must pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the somières at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with internal springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three cm are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smooth.
"By touching it with your hand or by staying on the mattress, no doubt the docks should not be noticed," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a particular type of somier.
The fully covered bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like siames, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your back, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life on the mattress of up to 25 years or even of a life assurance.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the floor, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently made with zipper closures throughout their perimeter, so by opening them they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and washing size!), their handling in the larger models (and for one person) when raising the mattress may seem like a fight between a moss weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for the beds thought to spend one night visiting.
However, you must make (if you do not already have them) ventilating holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For somières of non-combinable sheets containing between 14 and 18 sheets, mattresses of latex or sandwich mattresses may be used (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better a somier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity may be regulated.
Articulate sheet somières should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the blades, the protection of shoulders may also be used.
It is a special fixation of the blades that allows to press or even tilt the blades in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during the sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, it is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area just around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around their hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somières with cross structure or tablets with so-called multitorsion damping.
Pressure is distributed between different points and tension is lowered.
It should also take into account that, although you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wet"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow should hold the head and corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the pillows can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow must be on the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softest area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use more and more natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are in fashion.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soya.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is manufactured only from materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress floor, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh scent to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress bottom absorbs the heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, making them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffness allows the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function often have lower VAT, as they are considered health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save on mattresses and somières.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreize mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelastics with an open cellular structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the take-offs the astronauts were subjected to a huge burden.
Tempor softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only on mattresses but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use monitoring devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think of controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for the monitoring of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a cabinet box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to say that it is not a matter of spying, but of another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy happening," says Petro Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will just throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child wears some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, you will also look for them, as your sale will no doubt be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, offenders always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, you will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices include a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips away and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that for the moment they are devices with a size similar to a set of bezels or smaller mobile phones.
So they can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a certain amount of time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for the tracking of vehicles.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough scissors to surround all Czechs, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecca to arrest explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of mech.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the wick's useful life is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the explosive wick for the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mica by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres per meta per year.
According to the military pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided that, in such a case, all high-ranking generals and even secretaries and cleaners should carry out such manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year.
They did not want to be exempt, nor did the Minister of Defence Alexandre Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Pick army.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometers of mech.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mesh, the army would have with the new purchase (even by adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade had personally complained to Minister Vondra recently because they said they had little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money were restricted.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that he repeatedly buys us such quantities of wick."
"But it's your decision and they'll no doubt know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," STV Group's commercial director Jan Děcký admits.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of mecca also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that when he bought 445 kilometers of mecca, he obtained a discount.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says the spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the munitions of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not since surpassed 1,500 metres in years.
In addition, the police always demand only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of their useful life.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, moreover, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem with the current problem will occur: hundreds of miles of old mecca, which is now being purchased "barrata".
Until now I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukaš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec won the "Empresario of the Year" contest.
His success story seems to be taken from a film.
Lukaš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings I found with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-runned composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the price-quality relationship of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," Lukáš Pytloun says.
He started renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned the investment back in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a franchise in Pytloun," entrepreneur number one said last year.
"To this sale of licences for opening hotels greatly helped to win the 'Employee of the Year' competition," adds grateful Pytloun.
Victory increased its fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the street, they still often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
No doubt, he recommends that everyone try some company that participates in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition I have usually begun to collaborate."
The reputation associated with success, in his view, also included employees,
Totally about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," Lukaš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already been the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žשárský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's "Entreprise of the Year", last year at the "Casa slave" in Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česka Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," said the winner last year.
The history of Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, it did not hesitate too much; it resigned its position in the company in which she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with her father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
They also gained greater presence among the non-specialised public after reaching success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Žשárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a display of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also received recognition for the trade results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of such a situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some lay-offs," Karel Žשárský explains.
A viable company must sometimes even take unpopulated measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs," says Žשárský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žשárský.
A survey that unveils ridiculous rules
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when carrying out a control of the taxes of the insured," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Survey Absurdity of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and employers in Czechia must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create a hobby among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations which must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers necessary for tax reporting we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, Czechia is placed in position 74a, i.e. eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and late September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He earns the absurdity he gets more votes.
This year's survey presented more than a hundred, including 105 meaningless rules and regulations.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held early in November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social personalities often participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to hinder entrepreneurs, so my objective is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that are currently unnecessarily complicated by trade," announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in rubber water.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention of going to a fair or exhibition with a post.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation which ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work travel of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's gonna beat her.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physical therapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two soil scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské Noviny competition is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the competition of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special sub-category of this year's edition of the 2010 Vodafone Entreprise main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between each other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, disabled persons, other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic, for example, was the company Pragense de software Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperwork that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70 per cent of the staff; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the Central Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys Czech manufacturers priority, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible for our production and administration activities to produce the least environmental impact," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses catering services from a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in distress grant, which helps the local Roma community in particular," comments the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
They are also well placed with mention the Prani laundry company in čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of skills and leisure," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the Corporate category responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year were automatically appointed and answered the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
Organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company competition responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the main Company Competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives hand over a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt is intended to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of rights so that the subsidised land is received by a precise interested person.
He was supposed to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," said Právo the head of the Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered the questions of Provo saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and went during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value greater than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined and the Agricultural Fund then transfers the land to the person offering the greatest offer," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be presented to the summons and, at the same time, he was interested because he had acquired various rights of restitution, proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he's been collecting a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the place where a large road should be built in the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate by a house in the city's own historic center with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional costs of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
Consequently, families will have to take several hundred crowns from the portfolio from January onwards more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by about 2 per cent, in some cities will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns per year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, as it has increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
However, gas increases moderately, especially when heating is most used and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are growing throughout the country, the price change in central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is planned mainly by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay from January for central heating about 50 more krona per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional krona per year.
Residents in Prague must also bear 9% of the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The prices of the rental of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague can be considerably increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regular rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the next year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer fit, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under 15 years of age.
Children who end up in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who find themselves in such cases in admissions of pediatrics from the hospital.
"Drink beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," says Provo, the head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in downtown Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to their father from the pan, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and that it doesn't smell so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use a ranger that they caught at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13-year-old drinkers and 14-year-olds usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It began at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't even surprise him that her daughter had disappeared for 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even their clear tolerance to drink on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence itself.
"A person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years is understood as an alcoholic, with all the phenomena associated with it, which is not occurring in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is because of a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman for Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol was hospitalized until mid-November 40 drunk children.
However, statistics show only those who develop serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after travelling medical recognition, go home to their parents or to the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply gather after school and drink bright drinks, for Pelikán there are three seasonal elevations to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at the same time," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing the body.
"They carry it much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Transfers in ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when during the visit I tell the children directly how much it has cost them to get drunk and that they would have to spend all summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," says Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a retroactive measure, which usually returns treatment expenses to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are located for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced House C-295M, set off on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device of this type is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to carry out exercise or demonstration flights.
This is the L-159T1 bi-place version, which so far used the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three planes are the L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, has already taken care of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes physically will be taken from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaces exchanged in their current state," he told Provo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 two-seater devices.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to add aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejšek says.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a House plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the Mirek Topolánek government.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a tender for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes House is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three House planes and the last one should arrive at the airport plague Kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with the longest rate that annular is at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
They could be dependent on testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter right-hand index finger than the annular finger.
They had the same odds of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer rate than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "expressed completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered with snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and the Quitanie machines circulated all night through numerous areas.
In the morning, road D5 between kilometres 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news transmitted it to the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (UAMK).
In km 91 a truck was damaged, in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
A number of tourists also ended up in the pier.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway at km 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
Drivers should move slowly after Brno in the kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join in the kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
Several kilometers of blockage have been formed there.
There has also been an accident on road D11, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-centimeter snow cover and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Blockages are being formed, for example, in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are running late, for example on the line between Karlovo Náměstí and Náměstí Mírú.
At eight in the morning, another crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralpupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
At present, it can already be circulated on most of the southern roads of Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to the road, in Brněnska snow-languages are being formed and in Blankenska chains are needed to access certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Up to now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open up for circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpathy (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural zone, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, ČTK indicates.
In Czechia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, plus in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snows gradually return to Czechia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trenches.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws its murderous rain from metal astils, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the goal, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say it's been 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun loads and throws the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium relocates its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium relocates its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computer sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year of their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 more employees from the consortium, who were formerly scattered throughout the region, would stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is currently very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused joy yesterday among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's Head of Economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with that, a Global Player has been won.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu sits in the city, settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"We have naturally offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, now there is a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building show cooperatives."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" have been part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project of the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which takes care of the criticism of the massive building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and taxation companies were installed, the Software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third-largest global IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, anyway Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
This is why 7,000 square metres have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats to Assange
The distress is taking over Wikileaks more and more.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Possibly behind are political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is apparently arrested in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people wanted by Interpol, must remain in custody in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the disclosure activists reported through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website in order to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we'll spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported the chain CNN according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate's council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, said the British "Guardian".
"I wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America's statements.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged by treason and must be executed.
In Canada, a government chief advisor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, said on television, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for U.S. President Barack Obama, described Assange as "ridiculous and absurd" that he had applied for the resignation of the State Secretary, in case she was responsible for ordering diplomats recently to engage in spying tasks.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy distribution director of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional director, announced the White House.
Thus Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to deal with the security of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks must be put at risk.
"We've done our best to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream cookers are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream produces cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream processing.
The ice cream takes out with a spatula the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the mild ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice-cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is its good taste decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly the southern part of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and come out a basic pasteurized white cream, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be processed only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experience?
Luciano advises that they be dismissed from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in basic mass are allowed.
Scents are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Also, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must ever experience it."
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more aroma of tofe or more pure fruit.
There is no need for the hazelnut ice cream to know about dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the lovely kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The processing of ice cream is a problem of artimetics: The melocotton puree is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe should be lowered.
For lemon ice cream it takes an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winegrower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Developing ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is simultaneously beaten and cooled at a temperature below zero.
However, all automation remains out on the small paste.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puré, as if it were a giant mini-primer without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that happens like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another expert from Efsa have also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost him.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly on Efsa’s verification standards of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa provisions are in paragraphs in the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the Environment Office and a clear EU parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data are used, including some in the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the assessment of the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which offers no reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the United States and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of 400 kilos.
Monday was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba in the back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large portion of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was stuck, most of the wing became rubble.
It rotates in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the slices.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The stone trail of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy munitions warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"He would be disgraced, would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden cottage that once was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing to the company of overthrows.
He spoke to the 21st enemy for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the maxizo of 80 kilos cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of it was sold long ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long become "the wall" or in the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his tortoise, toures for his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones bitten.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good travertine."
In the past, the solids belonged to the Neckarstadion gallery in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, drum of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something had been destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immeasurably rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer a place to do, as well as canteens, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a windowkeeper and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Struggling talent around great potentials
There's an active fluency in the buffet.
16 students swallow around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students in universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try to draw on the outstanding talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to the interested young talents the training and work programs for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The news is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All the students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its acronyms in German), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers' posts.
And according to the VDI forecasts, this gap of engineers will grow even further.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for hunting talent.
It organizes costly recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For hunters Dykta the notes give results.
"Today we have similar action in the past year with all the participants."
"Some are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's being very complicated to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, such as Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that they can do practice with us or carry out their thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," said Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld boasts 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what the employee asks how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in the same and observes the prior conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in his classification by his aspirants to work.
"I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
Gives your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer passes through the employees themselves," he says.
At the branch of the sector is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff.
"One satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Petroleum Drills
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years no new oil drilling.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and therefore nullified its previous plans in an impeccable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast are new drillings blocked by the moment.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What provoked this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the tragedy that cost 11 workers their lives and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigation commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil consortia filed applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using harder controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with corruption charges, has fallen into disrepute, is reformed.
Obama announces in parallel that the profit tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the advisory company BDO - before the ban on the extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended as soon as possible, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, smells like a petrol station: Millions of liters of crude spills have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today will pass enough oil before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
There is no evidence that brown oil spots float on the surface.
He used to take shrimps with fists, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands by a broken pipe.
The fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the way through the river passing through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will bring out some oily stuff.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark licorice sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain they seek bands of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as usual: As soon as the barrier of the outside is shut, a sort of ghostly calmness of an earlier paradise with a gas station smells.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for health."
The war compares.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a tough battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke down more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While daily pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire Delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms as extraphalary water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every instant a head fails, Akpobari ops, then commands a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured over 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the quantity of oil penetrates, as in the wreckage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell Consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break up and pipes with leaks like the main drivers.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of security normally in the world conventionals, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the fault indexes of the pipes are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there is a workshop full of oil under the free sky, there are figures from among the mangroves: they are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil warms up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drops and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta people take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of only 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost per day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in algebras and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the weak mode of production.
"If oil tankers did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely broken up our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warned of a potential factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated impacts: In a connection of hoses, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed an application in the federal court in Sydney which allowed further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests on super-junks equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft's emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double deck plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Hiela Germany: In almost the whole country cold temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and the east, there is a 15 cm thick snow layer.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and in many streets.
In the A7 at Flensburg height, the ski lifts are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep off the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects lively tides with a water level of 1.2 metres above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called at Sächsischen Schweiz, the highest alert actually.
There there are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for rounding it up.
Many trucks and cars were caught there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major riots in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed traffic and created bottlenecks.
In Thuringia the snows affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or destroyed catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, Leipzig's interurban service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink blankets.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information centre, in Munich some cancellations have already been announced.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The quitannieves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers swept at the airport, despite that there are 400 camping beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver passed away in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinist suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: Here, too, a truck was reached at a road crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Weather scientists have good news: The snow will become more and more soft and dust-like and will therefore roll in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
You're looking for a buyer for your twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of reinvasion, and look for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesperson.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution once again renounces its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the renowned newspaper as "Greentours" in about 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning the dead miners
In New Zealand, over 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the place of misfortune, but it did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Family members and friends now remember those who died with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the brilliant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved half an auction in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the family members of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the crushing temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the police chief, told the journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of gender with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and take out his enemies the tribes of his bodies alive when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried by at most one or two phrases or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the bastions offer to the Viking world of approximately a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients, it is a shame that they cannot rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his wildlings and trilogy on the hairy drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he Stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more humor in the main current or something less brutality of the artistic home.
A brain mass and popping tribes cannot deter most of the artistic cinema followers.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity in calm and fog is stuck before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptive and bloody facade, you hide a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only counted a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, preserves something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to express its opinion on this subject until controls are allowed.
About the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighter F-15 I aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the edge of Euphrates; the larger and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the US International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the nearby Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
The technique, on the other hand, only serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from within.
Recently the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is hardly more known than at that time, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
The former President of the United States, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was totally certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he had barely seen any evidence that there was a "nuclear weapon program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in the summer in a streak that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly disposed of the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground to conscience.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium trails in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite imagery on a Member State, from commercial sellers at the moment just after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as verosimil after particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss the matter, as well as satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are banned from a second inspection in the-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," said Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, is finally pending a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which oversees the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until the time of which equipment is being processed, nor what functions they have, nor if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, IAEA has designated Marj as an inner member of Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits the entry to the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna Syrians are said to fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities", no enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor shall be operated with uranium which is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its ability as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be chance but it just helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not much urgency, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, scolds the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means the Venezuelan nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: To do so, most of the IAEA’s governing board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if they don't find anything?"
Love in Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
Rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, and at the last moment they moved several days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not a diplomat, women offered her a meeting in Hungary weeks ago that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on this is enough for the victims on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The ministry of Bosnian culture that read the script, granted behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not yet.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is actively introduced into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content is still imprecise.
In the network a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape is in love with torturer."
It is certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, as many others have before.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon it finally becomes good for the Irish.
No Trail of Distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as they retread the loud music, beat the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this crazy drinking game and the discrete computer don't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to be distracted by the fulminant question, what will come to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's too far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "of one shot he got the work of his dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already looked for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as a IT consultant in Londrés.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis especially confuses well-formed young Irish people, for whom so far everything is up.
The loss of employment and the social downturn seemed absurd in boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything goes down."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and thus to an entire generation."
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future emerge because the government is only engaged in assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your peers range from unrecognized practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On their website are photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and of another one practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For the past half year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish fellow construction workers in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as long ago he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes to the frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
You've worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that bothers him of extreme importance: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Good-bye, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey in September and early October highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty is only marginally increasing in 2009 and has been reduced again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more polled in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem their country faces (see Graph 5).
About 31 per cent states that, either they or a close relative, has been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and that is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see Graph 6).
About 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% supports private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to waste
No one hoped that the general elections held in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners were afraid trying to help the country back up after its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and acts of intimidation.
Electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were given for defeat.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the gap will take place in January.
Not all hopes regarding elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has gone to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic destroys the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been evident, Haitians themselves also think so.
Moving from stitches to center
In the weeks that have passed since losing her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, which may turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to draw up budgets that were undervalued by tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepant members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a deputy punched the other in the face and other deputies accused the bribery government, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to the next year, which will give the President an even greater margin of action when it is spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the union's wage requirements, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modernize these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that's why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused to have a previous forcible debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped into the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term of office ends, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband next to her.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether you reject or not, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Midworth by China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think about her big brother on the other side of the narrow?
Over 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, went on 27 November to elect the mayors and councilmen of five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of the feelings on the continent, building innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been driven by total independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD embroidered with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempted rigor murder fail.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man right in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge himself of the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow down to the KMT.
Maybe the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not being dealt with.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the grid.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
No doubt he would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to be held.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as well as Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that you can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off had they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present himself to the presidents.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT should also carry out a conscientious review.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT states that it will restructure its office, as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the Artist's category of revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been a acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys that he must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums before recording that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Its ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a big breakthrough and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least distinguish between Spalding and the way to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently focused on the field of jazz for this category.
In the other categories, the Grammy voters duly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and teclist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and a regular guest in HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, moreover, leans considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a deserved recognition in the category of great groups, competing against the great chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bajist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, with five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classical producer category of the year includes five names: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Orchestra Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the names are Berg by the "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No 4, Daugherty by "Gods Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassisively Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated by instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to be played in Avi Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"It composed with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was appointed in the orchestra function category by directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Named instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, the soprano Jessye Norman was named for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The Mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordering commission
The Temecula Mosque project has obtained unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it promotes terrorism and blockades.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, whether Christian or Jewish or Baha'i, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time people were dedicated to interceding in favour or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"It's another apes planet with Mrs. Libertad dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans to build Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks on 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has lived smoothly for years in Riverside County, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse that rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents may still resort to the project before the Municipal Council.
A arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the major elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although little is missing to be a really 'alien' type of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the Science publication Thursday.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance carried out.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"It may therefore be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough so that it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it enters and, in some way, calls biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be a natural way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was most common in the early ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the sheriff's officers of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welshes Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as reported by the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They've returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is being carried out."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following a few leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a three-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered harm.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions planned for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, according to Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour of almost two months that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
Normally they stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer breed, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan "pre-armed" by creditors to eliminate approximately $5 billion debt, pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
The Thursday ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on how to manage their finances while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and expert in bankruptcy recovery, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of discussion and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who have already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company's management services, will receive "successful fees" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual set of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national toys salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less than last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are kitten toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is tightened.
A pressing is equivalent to a note, and a second pressing starts to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts pressing, it cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Lending from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animated doll plays turn-around games like Simom Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
Children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of questions letters designed to convert a ride by car into a session with an eventful self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first major point on the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of tiles, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to set words by putting the blocks in line before time ends; it is formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
slightly larger than the pig in his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microrobots powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also lasting.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
More moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban sergeant instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the women's members of the Chester, the stubborn police officers of the urban order of China, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to report a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign!"
"Pay attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical green olive jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think you have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, maliciously.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of urban inspectors in China.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating gazes: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a disculo cart of snacks, and observed it with constant frenzy for half an hour, until the travelling salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's minimal respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, they would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of Hubei Province shot a passerby after using their cell phone to film them as they dissolved a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively scourgeing offenders without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai Sandias street vendor suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents to inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical dispute.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district had requested eight new female recruits by a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, an almost government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates shall determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities".
The women's hangovers are like florists, he said, and he added, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that the high demands were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disabled or disfigured must not be presented.
"We can't allow a person to poke or a geek to come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old colleague Xu Yang said, "Our job must present the image of the city."
They are also opposed to their work on a certain time, they said, because they have higher career ambitions that simply run away from sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors, either by foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pans or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning her bicycle-drawn car with fideo garrisons.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' goods.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, mutinyed after the false rumor that some officers had killed a seller was spread.
More than a dozen police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were either burned or burned.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, opened up to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, aged 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40-year-olds or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time it is the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the Department of Justice prosecutors have apologized to Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure lobby work for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national headlines last year and would damage his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "probably happy" with the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate's ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers told us that the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this matter."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confabulated to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobby work, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affairs of the senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolutioning door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct of procedure.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separate from the ethics group, which alleges that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through the lobby thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "machaching" the Ministry of the Interior about a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended lunch with Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to make lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign two weeks ago told journalists that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow quickly the example of the Department of Justice and complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the court room.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the dreadful testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have filed written in the court outlining the arguments of appeals that they will probably occupy in the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exciting details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr Hayes' prime lawyer.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in a judgement last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was brought by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a 1966 historic judgement, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them scary photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some juries have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict on his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media kept throwing firewood at the emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps all over the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the slowest reports, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In his writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the process's coverage, and made it clear that they would require the new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civicism lay a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, a little civilism has been triggered this week in Washington.
Is it a premonition of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But as they all say, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a trial period, testing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments of the meeting by the participants was made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance are involved, the two parties are in opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, the Republicans and Democrats had no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and nobody's in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying the unemployment subsidy for the unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these items during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112nd. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which contributed decisively to its creation.
As the Republican leaders are more aware of the dangers of overstating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut down state spending and annul the new health law.
These support lines are already clearly observed in initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officers elected on the panel, suggesting that there are at least currently few bases or wishes for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House Republicans and the Congressmen.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at their time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will take much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves some of the bribes and protection money directly collected by the Kremlin, as reported in February by the US Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each strata of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blame him for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several claims for libel on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's stupid, it's annoying."
According to the polls, Russians believe overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats in a foreign country to do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," says the note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "the roof" or protection) that passes over the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that the best is to get the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking bags, probably filled with cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur late at Moscow's night, will certainly cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite the fact that Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed American diplomats were calling him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, it would have been done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concretely dimly lit classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Mr. Kor Ma.
Known as the "Carnicero" for its brutality during the Red Jemeres government, the commander continues to be popular in this remote fortress of the Red Jemeres in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, the long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and the western Cambodia jungles, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began deserting to the government, culminating in the yields of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest Red Jemer fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for weapons, the spawning soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have obtained few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply."
The current Court of the Red Jemers has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jemers.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the principal leaders and those with the greatest responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This is not much used to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Menchey province during the Red Jemere government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had overseen the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent noisy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parsley grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She said that if the court called her, she wouldn't show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more trials, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although the experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved text book on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemers, despite the link of the city to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they're not sure how many people will be prosecuted by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers preserve a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hot tub covered by an oxidized roof of leaves.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile salesman on the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its qualified uranium reserve for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for arming a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and the uranium of low enrichment," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out on a plane.
The U.S. government spent 13 million dollars on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-rich uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy who works in Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, as stated in the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested potential distension.
It was stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US Ambassador in Madrid expressed in a telegram.
This is reflected in the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then prime vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to show that they were exercising appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights of about a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "unsuspected pillaged," reports Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then foreign holder, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 at lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he said that "although Spanish judges are angrily jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action on this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he says.
Parricide confesses complains in the network of the "agobe" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used when he was a child, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natures of Girl, the corrupt people of which she came from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, that ABC rebuilds through testimonies from their relatives.
The young Galician, 30-year-old, started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
She soon got to know him another boyfriend.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of the communications, you can see that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008, she was in Menorca alone and wrote: "Alberto is very rare and mosqueated, because I came to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it is like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants."
Then, talk about a message on the mobile that you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the child with my mother, I'll pick him up when he comes back," she says.
In May, he talks about the return of his people: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to be there until 19, because on 20 I have to present myself to a job not to lose it."
Make it clear that if everything works out for him, he takes his firstborn.
"It will be with whom it owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever happen to leave it with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intention given their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"It will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so I save myself a little bit of kangaroo paste."
On 17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he told you not to know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck yourself."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's ahead of me money."
On the Internet there are messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the Prisoner."
"Terror in the Galician (e.g.)."
The last man who cohabited with her, guards a jury, declares her grief for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma provincial penitentiary yesterday, from the juvenile court centre in Menorca.
Official counsel, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has a general view because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training obtains in these elections usually double the number of votes it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans received 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure was 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend has been maintained, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it is 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 MPs (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - now has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relief at the head of the Barcelona Deputacy, one of the administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree that the CSP may lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or a chance to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be out of the question that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the return to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
People have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by police officers of the General Police Intelligence Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups in Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of the latest Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weaked" internationally and, therefore, "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
In addition to Thai services, other European police units, the jihadist network was not the only one operating in Europe, so it is not clear that in the next few days similar blows have taken place on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammadica Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones leading the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found that links the arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency some $1,000 that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended up with the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the fiscal concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and to sum up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to avoiding philo-superanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to be desired, since the candidate for CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain from the vote of investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks that these days hold but with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all the sovereign and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have a common commitment to softening the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citatans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not "lack of measures"
The Olot center owners don't discard the fact that their janitor killed more than 11 elderly people.
The head of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
Moreover, in addition to the social downsizing that the entity may suffer for not detecting in time the criminal activities of the cellor, the great threat to La Caritat now takes a substantial form of compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed to the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, denied this extreme abrupt yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been the cause of what has happened at any time."
The attorney for La Caritat added that "there is no single indication in the case that there has been an unwise action on the part of any other person other than the defendant himself".
He already named "Angel de la Muerte" confessed yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pinching him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
The insulin strokes and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his attempt to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to put them to death.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to be clarified if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he embraced them inside giving them light as he has already confessed he did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellor, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his course of action after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
ECB Threatened
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the Trichet threat that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the actions of the European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely pointed out what is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is the result of an iquitous market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take long to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retract tomorrow for a fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that they will maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bonus buying program and even signal it to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God will assist us!
As with their May meeting when they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal dropped 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion short-term and 15 000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope it will be solved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an aid plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in available liquidity the triple that in March, to expensive types and closes you access to the sine-die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "besides being, it seems."
Cheer up, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's board asked for his children
The temporal does not heal in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge it by considering it as "no full law", the El Enebro judicial board on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and make themselves with the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia's signature.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new court chapter in their dispute over the control of the group.
The founder of the largest company holding services to the company does not seem willing to give in to its dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors, five of his seven sons were disbanded who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Trade Register.
El Enebro's court board for the next day 16, convened by the judge of Mercantile No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants to their five children, through procedural arguity, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null board on 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the appeal, after the board has been held, to the effect that it is “no full right”.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
The seven sons of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital in El Enebro, the heritage society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets.
The founder of the service group, however, claims that 51 per cent of the capital is used, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal has been held, for which there is still no date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into Formula 1's world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squire and, despite the ascending trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso Ferrari.
Without demerging the skill as a final champion driver, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for far-reaching purposes from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utilitarian cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the escudos in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
On the Red Bull team today, 180 high-quality young professionals work, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzing and projecting all sorts of modifications in the bolides.
Siemens's manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's bolides except the engine, which is the full responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its rockets in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and their notoriety is null.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago, it could be said that R & D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology adds 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened in Barcelona yesterday his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20-trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president Helena Herrero set out as an example the refurbished shop located on the Gran Via Barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, and Barcelona was the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and handles the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of trades aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, caring, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP's computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets 'to steal' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and vatics the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate in part for increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million private customers, his subject matter pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have three years of operation.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to earn market share with the capture of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted -, their large outstanding subject, since so far it had spoiled SMEs and businesses more than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment for productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare to set targets and make them public at this time, as the financial crisis has disrupted all global banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima Master Plan, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main objective.
In a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the passive war, which penalises the margins, is decreasing, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Wardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see Five Days of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend is now "getting up commissions", but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that Spain "is going to require larger sizes."
"The next year will move everything," he said.
It states that capital needs are "highly raised" and does not rule out any Spanish financial entity entering in red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplant the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers already vote as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that there would be an wave of mergers of savings boxes and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentrating Spanish savings boxes, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank Group cannot be said to be a second round, which there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 let's go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been made and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot too," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast by the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the concentration process is taking place "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the deadlines that, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"To pass from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion volume of assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and which "is going as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank had very well stopped the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the EUR 426 aid to unemployed without benefit, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another foolish turn in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is in shock with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals of sisters with greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government withdrew from the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour and stability plans in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, once again Merkel emerges with a clear position, calling for reform of the EU treaties, in order to make a country's rescue possible and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we have to take measures with which we may not agree very much, from that date on the former operation of the euro, it will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand.
It is not just a question of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater peace of mind.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they gave us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too crowded from countries that are not serious, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sports and fraud
Cheats like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willing to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match disputed on 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behaviour is anti-sportive and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in the time to make mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will now end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next league match, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two parties, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but then of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and that at times past has fined its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode further to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such conduct not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are committed fraud of the law, because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question goes on to examine the type of damage to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the clean game is to prevent the team of the infringers from taking unfair advantage of the opposing equipment, which also did not happen.
However, the paradoxical of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They looked forward to and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do the offenders gain from the deliberate misconduct under review.
Here it seems necessary to note that it does not put the rival in a disadvantage or benefit in the same party, for the result of the action obviously means leaving the team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be eliminated from the first change, and in addition with this performance players perform a penalty match and pass into the second cycle of cards, in which card accumulation suspension occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not run counter to the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that help to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud of the law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsion and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offer offensive to capture group Christmas dinners in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
They proliferate the celebrations self-suffered by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bullfighter and the lottery, with the arrival of December they also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have resulted in a price-adjusted offensive to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to end up complicated accounting, this year's calendar (when the Nightfall falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for days tip (on 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budget question.
In order not to disregard tradition, many workers keep it by paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the President of the Gremi de Restoration de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not dare to cheer up what this month's festivities will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"You want to go out but you have the alerts on the issue of prices," he points out.
The business will go well "those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the fringe around the 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey at various central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a real boom of applications for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance reservations, even since early November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Grup, which banners El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing from the second half and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends precipitating the parties.
To its six group menus they have added a Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that reinvite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the patronage Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "enlived", although the customers "negotiate at most".
Yes, the illusion by the festivities has not gone down, pays who pays, indicates.
Pakistan’s Nuclear Programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to territory under Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferative and reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Koroliv of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most up-to-date of the documents filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are not answered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "Despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism officer to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates from 20 November.
And it's not about the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but about the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, asserts that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free way notice network to proceed to an arrest -- which must be charged by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by videoconferencing.
They also remember that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from his case prosecutor, to whom they compare with the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silenced.
On Monday he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "foolish and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, with the task of preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to minimize importance to Assange contrasts with views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January onwards, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and to prosecute anyone who has any contribution or assistance."
Even further has Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, ex-government of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," stated in the Fox chain.
Puigcircós seeks peace in ERC with sharks like Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the fifth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation hideout is insufficient for the associates of the former Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can in no way cause him the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with slashes that allow him to shield himself to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on their continuity in secret.
With paperboards, not by hand raised.
If the Karodists want to give a certain vote of punishment to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the line wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered to be ratified by half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result "to the Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demand the president more than to place his office at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But if they don't have the majority enough to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a road map from here to May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
Its intention is to swallow Puigcircós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty rags from doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic that the acting advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació in fact gave that the leader will be condemned "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. to include new faces that come from the Chard sector.
The second can be great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once assemblage as a mechanism of operation.
He therefore advocated a reform of the statutes that would allow the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsed left the responsibility of the management to review the assembly at a specific Congress of Statute Reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of the last few years did not address the matter.
Now, without sectors critical to the eye, it can be a good time to resume it and try to close it forever.

Maintains China’s goals to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 40-45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45 percent by 2020, said His Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reinstate its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this regard.
He noted that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
All these items have made progress, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it has abounded, is in progress, or have already completed various multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for changing incandescent outbreaks by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the last five years and plans to do another one by 2020, it has abounded.
Pasted to the Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader explained that the former Panist leader is in his right to attend the National Order Commission to claim whatever is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was bound by the law and that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim whatever is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right, if any, to refer to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there was never an alliance for presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which he will have to choose his successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local choice that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panist leader specified that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not frightened by internal competition; the county "we enjoy and strengthen it", he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to choose the best or the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, so he will hand over the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the match that the party recorded in the past elections on 4 July would be reflected in the forthcoming contents, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be cause for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When questioned about the PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the Pris to reflect on the genders of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; they start to defend them; get out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the federal executive holder could make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promoting Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and invite them to pass it is legislation," tweeted the US president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and invite them to approve is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that requests the public to communicate immediately with senators, since the vote in the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the government's financing were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the issue of taxation has been resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax case before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at some point at that time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority Democrats of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and joined a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations play an intense role in ensuring the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act need to join several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the lake
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants galaed the story
"That sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the lake? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the lake... "puts us in a hurry," the Argentine writer whispered sweetly to the public, mostly of young people, who were quoted at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shuultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "lace" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which he does not get answers even though clues in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectologist it is convinced: "patience is not my strength, perhaps my sore".
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the lake I only learned that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be greatly interspersed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger on the lake is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch, who was playing clouds, brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, narration that came to speak later America, the great novel to which his own chroniclers had not missed since the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Certains who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination to which he lacked even the smell."
However, he pointed out "it is crazy and lying who best imagine" and is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its height.
He calls it in fact the "Cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what we count."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the lake resulted.
The Cuban-Puertoriquena pointed her towards the great scourge of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
In the evening the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed it, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the neck of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that leads to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means often to put the finger on the throat and to harass those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in white and black, in settled and toneless ideas and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats at the end, he has had a high degree in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who encounter each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had a high turn in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentinian has ended up comforting the medal of the sub-champion, left a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategist arrived at his first finish as coach at the Opening Tournament 2002, when he was carrying the reins of Morelia with which he fell overall of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 closure he also arrived at the decisive duel and also lost him overall of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended 2-2 tied up in front of the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty sign he put himself in front of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed since the 11 steps and suffered the turn 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his turn rival, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself, and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the rudder when he questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous end, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalty to throw, we were ready to go running out and I think that's a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the sign of penalties, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we need to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately it made us a bad move the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but if we left, that left us something for this end that we expected not to reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands stop being a sub-champion technician and for the first time prove the glory that gives the titles.
I change rules for visas
Persons should go to the Visa Applicant Service prior to their interview with the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 it will change the procedure of processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take the applicant's biometric information, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest AUC where they will present their documents and take their marks.
Because biometric information will be taken into the AUC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this time less than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

Announce NASA Extraterrestrial Life Finding
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will present tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The findings will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the quest for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life may exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will highlight the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when there was an opposition bloc in Congress, led by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not, then they will be swallowed up again by both parties and the opposing coalition is over.
"So far here (the opposition coalition) is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that the Congress after being monoply, now be "dupolic".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'boot' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let's leave 5 out that we're probably going to make 9 Members, save the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we've decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that's the subject that in the reform they made them agreed, we're out and we're not in agreement with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay City Hall of Mazatlán another check to the contested owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that has been paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year amounts to 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that he would come out more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many cheques are left to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, just being paid what is due, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "re-appeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law indicates when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after a review on 25 July, Northwest issued a review to the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality over 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to attend tourist sites
They regret tourists' accidents by the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Association of Traders, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that they are looking after the image of the destination and reverse how bad tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and take him back to nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise they didn't do the works in this way in such a time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from passing again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Escudo and the Venadite of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"No proper attention has been given and this type of fact shows something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
"Surely Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive in order to add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Requesting IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A legislator worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, which totals 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of new members of the State Congress is that they will come to conduct clean management and commitment with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patrons of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Corporate Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly debuted 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnivalal appearances of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move ahead with the Ruler in turn.
"We look forward to doing a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the signalists who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magic King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next King's Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a man.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives a humble home of the Colony Salvador Allende and lives up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"We sometimes look tough because my husband does not have a chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa... I go out with the 'plums' to sell on the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wishes for a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'Let's go see son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana said with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, aged 11, is size 12; Isaiah, aged 10, is size 10, while Miguel, aged 8, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help to him.
If you want to help make the dream come true of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the Search for a Mago King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 plants have been seized from Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two alleged network leaders, have been arrested, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could be confronted with the cannabis production charges, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests," said Mr Ruel.
About 70 police officers from the Estrie de la Seguridad del Quebec investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this operation.
Combating clandestine migration will be possible without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the countries loaded with illegal migrants, would surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite that you weigh," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants to stop for up to one year, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong target.
"We are against and, as it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we'll see what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected from one penitentiary the criticisms that her party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against those in charge of clandestine fathers, and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as a fempute."
"Wait for Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request that a vote be held so that each member who is going to oppose it can be explained to his or her constituents later.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent unit for combating corruption and collusion by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic to address the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad as "a rabbit pulled out of the spark" and as "a last-minute hat solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest is compelled to avoid the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, suggest Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general interventioner to conduct a poll on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general interventioner," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing people to be compelled to testify.
The creation of a permanent grid is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to engine groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored because of the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a land run occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landcourse took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions experienced heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these rainfalls add to the snowflake that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareu and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, severe rainfall has caused some lakes to disembark in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Prediction Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareu, the Acchigan, the Batscan and the Loup.
Partial Culpan in Dupont
The radio host of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain set of setbacks to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their rude language on radio.
The CCNR considered that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable and not misleading data.
With regard to suicide, the presentation of Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le medi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
Thus, any blame has been dropped in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once within the time of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs to the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance on the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for combats everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championship held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this stage, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san Shu" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to beat with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the adversaries to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will no doubt come to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It is like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"What won me is a real professional," she says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts there is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior invitation to tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Administration, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the Party MP Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how it could benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract has been awarded without the competition at stake; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energie gerance, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'Energy de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation which has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bidding and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Energie gerance forms part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energie gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783.344, including the Energy Administration contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more of their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The consumer trusts only in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in the fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe by which messages defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if the consumption of "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising thereof, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre for Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that bear the goods called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers take political speeches seriously on this issue.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers claim to also distrust the alleged yields of the ecological products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and preferred to buy cultivated food in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the King of Recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness appears to be from doors (of his car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of bicycles and on foot displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which it has requested financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his real film vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would actually be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des businesses culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, handed over a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely dismissed.
Let us remember that the Association of cinema owners and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinema rooms.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do require considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried for ten years the charge of the film author at his premises in the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to remain faithful to his clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, has been projecting films in eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February, projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des deux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada rose...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the Americans, but both reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday provide rather juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal electoral campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States does not get involved in the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "sudden silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the leader of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made anywhere that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington on the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series broadcast at the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little reference is made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable tells that during his first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kuchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that he depended on "everything."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed with regard to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered."
In the United States, Mike Huckabee echoes.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) by almost one third of the additional decrease to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, would be replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1,800 million tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should decrease global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilise, by 2020, the two-degree temperature increase in order to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in heat form and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also operate with reostates and emit very little heat.
Above that, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulbs, but the thermal coal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is spilled with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately," points out a spokesman for the UN Chief.
"Ask all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CIS President had commented on the television that the commission "keep working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
The Gbagbo side, however, has been cancelled by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has stated that the intimidation maneuvers of the FN voters in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged as "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the Presidentials on Sunday should have put a stop to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations has warned the Côte d'Ivoire political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% on the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in mainland territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the temporary seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the active population in mainland territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and seek or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years, which is 6.6% with the DOMs.
There has only been a stability of unemployment between 25 and 49 years of age, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into supposedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, cover, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, as reported by his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," AFP had declared his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the head of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to convey through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also jailed one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to deal with the landfills that must be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds relating to their implementation, he knows nothing about this, according to counsel Simon.
In the framework of this file, he is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but have released him on parole and has forbidden him to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Brindisier have been questioned by "abduction and misuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicity in misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social property".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying", has had in the village of the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the scrutiny of United States diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought for US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Elise's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "let go continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent," "immediate liberation."
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day it will take refuge in the French Embassy) "will require the Iranians to receive a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison after 12 days, but she's stuck in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released in Paris on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, close to Iranian clandestine nuclear procurement networks, Majid Khakavand's imprisonment is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that it did not.
Elisha said, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but he has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot nullify the decision" judicial.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The counselor of Elisha marks a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisha spares no effort, uses communications and "fugues" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediar".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, is the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that have led Elisha to give way to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he says.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been tarnished with premature and demerit."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praise it can receive if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
"At least this should lead to confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it from Elisha.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who had played an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "Cenician" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gambling companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then they find it difficult to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, as specified.
The government is also asking companies to limit daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the manager.
In addition, it will make it available to anyone who requests it free software that allows the time of Internet connection to be limited.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee appoints the 2018 World Cups organizers on Thursday and 2022, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can lead to technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cryff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions in the background, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) nominations have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has brought evidence to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British officials, who have been throwing themselves into an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's shine before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, converted into a heavy outsider despite the gaps in their candidacy (stages, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're getting out to shine their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organised the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, strongly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second terms of reference: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be re-applicant in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it is always necessary to appear that you doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not discard a third term.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy seriously indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you deal with UMP Members, on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked some revolt.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of terms of office of five years to two.
It just conveys the facts, not an ad.
It is not the first time that he talks about the presidents, with a playful tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst, or rather, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I won't wonder what will come next."
Their claims of yesterday are no longer close to the candidacy, nor are they.
Comments are issued for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by applying for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal went up to the lecture that led Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary; the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before it is planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he has responded immediately and prudently to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should enable the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk a more than complicated situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not mean to say whether he felt that the central bank should do more, for example, increasing its programme for the purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer more eloquent about his intentions, merely indicating that the State Letter purchase programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main type unchanged by 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury obligations has doubled last week to some EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change in direction.
Although lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine he's going to change his program considerably."
"If not, there would be a risk of new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011", he anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign euro area debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to keep its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in yields paid by the weaker states," said an important liability manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their debt, or even stabilising it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi capea the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflux of the types of 10 year obligations.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the departure of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they have heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unforeseen" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQs) had been triggered up to 263 points, causing a certain resurgence in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence in the markets" and a possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary arrangements could be implemented after the parties, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"Where necessary, new austerity measures shall be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a decision-making period would be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and in the day that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of the European States has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the rating of the debt of Portugal, the most frequent target today of speculations.
"As in May, political clarity and transparency are really lacking, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets".
Aware of this outbreak and of the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying their discussions to strengthen the mechanisms of exit from the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations among Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and generally with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched an Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the EFF’s first securities emissions will take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted Reuters to the United States agency that would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider essential for lasting confidence-building.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, pose the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of public obligations markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of about €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council that would undoubtedly be able to examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snows continue to cause difficulty in circulation, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Metéo France, the heavy fall snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandía, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause problems of circulation and affect some economic activities, the weather alert France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be driven safely in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardía.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to drive with the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly due to planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on modernising transport on the island of France has reached its high point, it has been raining billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be the amount that will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain market loans to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million a year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate it to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's away from 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that fiscal resources be added to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project moves forward", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time when income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion do not appear on the credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it unveils an apparent scandal, a scandal that just seems to scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is exclusively made up of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has long given Cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or anxious) the head of secret services (if he could not be, I know, libération editor), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the previous week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these files caused such a revolt?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can call on the telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become spy centers.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly, we just pretend we don't know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a poor image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker would be able to consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verks".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, at the time of Orwell, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true ever since, being able to control every move thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, autotrack taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be endured that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel once said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public realm; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it in a poster on the streets.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has moved by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can private and confidential relations be maintained in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a science fiction thing and therefore novelist, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly on uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as a matter of fact, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
This information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with wires (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a movie step by step, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to move forward or back from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels that it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing but normal that the communication policy and techniques take us back to the horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly uprooted in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats in its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked (called early or fast-start) funding promises made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to contributing EUR 7.2 billion in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really was worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudging official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while claiming to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each one who chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, believe that each euro lent amounts to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is clear to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated ... At most, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for its commitments for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it for its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that so frequently uses the loan.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union makes a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only brings 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only EUR 36.1 million, he gets the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has taken over arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States to continue to donate when they can just lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grains of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn early funding from this first year.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move discussions on the stakes in connection with long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning on Pesticides Ingested by Children
A 10-year-old child takes on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These foods, taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the gourds, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although virtually all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemical substances individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen potential carcinogenic wastes and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school tentempié, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green Jews, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were attached to pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon shoot was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "contaminants cocktails" generate for the consumer is "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Europe Ecological-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
