Looks like a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know about in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is big anything...
Yes at last we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break the noses of anyone during the drinking games (Finally, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted ourselves in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a game based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond misogynous jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about it at rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your harm and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students from these schools for whom competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
It is very different from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are "mysogy jokes" therefore acceptable?
It looks like the rugby club of my university, I've never seen racist behavior, but the nude races across campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body itself is in part made up of this ancestral water.
I'm gonna win in peace.
This interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:) is therefore also ancestral.
@lux You haven't read the article: one-half of your pasta water is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well we can still consider that the pasta fleet has on average more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already that it is.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophic and warm-upists of any hair that predicts the end of oceans and water resources, while this ever-present water.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What evidence is there that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophis" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the fresh water that accounts for less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And more generally it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species, but above all the reduction of little or no renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study that you cite and are making the generous effort to cite the source, there is little doubt of the truth of the conclusion.
Regarding freshwater problems, I assure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the ozone layer hole is closing quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, the religiously dogmatic and unreasonable ecology, no thank you.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 good-looking men would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
Probably not me!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving back, of course.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 above any permitted climate model give priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flattered.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear Government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is just a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms Wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is faulty and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants perform less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people need to eat them in much larger quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member of Parliament is a child is obvious.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from breaking the XVIIe rules.
However, punishing him and not Tevenoud is incomprehensible to the world, even if the NA's settlement is not a tax treaty.
If this lady does all this business, it's not her honor, it's mostly hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Académie" had blurred: "Let's call the guardian or guardianship of the Seals" (post that so far had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machismo!
"The political arena" .....!
The sand basin, the rear court of the Republic is replete, the marigot of the operator's mouths, the table of illusions, etc.
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Phallocrate Humpist sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning the + elementary civilization under the false umbrella of good manners, the penalty applies to him "it's quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his mesuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making the challenge to get him to talk about him.
So far he was unknown, now he can pride himself on being known as any primary-class cancer is known.
The academium on the back and we can see that Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to focus on solving its internal problems and stop causing couacs and scandals.
The Academy's got a good back, especially when we get him to tell him what she's not saying.
This Member of Parliament acts as a collegiate in the face of a crisis of adolescence, which causes provocation and whose friends go, in their delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the hours of collegiate work.
and defending him on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of MPs UMP.
Mr. Judge, I am calling on two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otarias, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are passionate about the majority of our 80 years of working, moving and doing stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our life span, but we pass the majority into boredom.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to look for, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that a lot of shit is being heard about animals that are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game is not just "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play on the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes him live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the info without being able to react 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be rather enthusiastic about those who seem to be crazy about the first time.
But when we see what many have learned at school, especially among the most likely audience to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the least beginning of an anchor point.
"the most likely audience to engage in attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even if it doesn't necessarily match your patterns of thought.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disgruntled youth too!
If reactions were no longer reacting, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything about it at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Should I think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values...
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How to start reading life when you can't read?
And is it that young socialists go to suburban schools to teach men and women equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but you should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article isn't going to be cool.
It's not time to joke around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double-sense word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 books for that?
It wouldn't even fill a 90-year-old's stomach in a retirement home.
How come the more we pay, the less there's in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by the weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
Of course it must not be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least, they made the effort to put up some blankets.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
Is the Manif for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's it: a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "making children".
A child must not be raised in a battery breeding plant or manufactured by a technological device.
Batteries?
Where do you get that?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacture" it is necessary to claim the prohibition of WFP for heterosexual couples, that would deserve consistency.
I am surprised that the manif referred to as "for all" has not yet this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only Catholics who manifest themselves: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This, it is nevertheless useful to remember that these different churches have always been opposed to all the evolutions of society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently opposed to the desire of the gvt to admit girls to school in the name of the "defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be granted to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be catho to get rid of the mercanization of the stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom ceases to be that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the same right to love themselves as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this is also true for heteros in search of GPA.
I just can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of wild stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has achieved, I will not talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa bring or did not bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why it won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07, 2014 12:48 Recommendation 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney right now so you can forgive yourself for doing so too.
That said it is good to note that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive passes in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at football or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve as much selections as Rooney and B) would score as much goals if he had as many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's capacity criticisms come from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be regularly selected in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Do you seriously compare Wayne Rooney's qualities of footballer (even no attacker) to those of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without kidding?
There are really people in the mass.
Please also note for your governor that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that by joking.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those in this school just don't agree with the U.S. arms port authorization!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids are playing with fake guns at this age in our house?
Does this make them powerful murderers anyway?
Even though the arms port is in the American constitution and it necessarily affects the country's culture, I don't think rich kids are significantly different from ours.
A bit of common sense and preserved reason svp.
It's a disarming process!
Give yourself up!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have, first-guesses to the taste of the morbid.
Could we assume that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of five?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the mabouls of this school than the students!
Let the parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is very relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the USA, but is a part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
What relative youth?
These brilliant blue ribs that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first pictures, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled-up sweater.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but it all seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Contrary, maybe?
But what does it look like?
You're ahead of me.
I would have thought a thin knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "extrusion," he meant "absorbing."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could advance that their intention was to ostracize her.
But not here.
It seems to have been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
That's not weird.
haha, who knows what he's been able to say?
Probably nothing, but someone wanted to mention something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "extrusion," which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States still fell in August, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, together with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live there at this point, I will say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequalities become crazy.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a magnitude that is not imagined in Europe But Americans maintain incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forget the essence.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards will not be able to give the change for long...
Based on the exhaustion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "trick" or rather bite.
I can't blush that Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad makes it lose even more support at home?
I probably can't imagine.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it's played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed to "get the nose on the right in diversity"
Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the by-election in safe seats against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of maneuver, the pendulum has stretched far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it's going to start in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe seat of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Sure, the Tories saw worse, but for Labour it's a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "Victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "failed", it wins the battle!
I agree with Jack, it's a victory, but she's thin.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice from Canada, Greenland and northern Russia that has been hard.
However, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March, etc., should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "pasteful" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "simply simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground crutch, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which gives/gives a) a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "fowl stroke" or the facilitation of access to the localized surface will be (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inversely Regarding climate warming, I think it is prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this Volcanism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Is it prudent not to heat up any more?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we don't see any better.
Hello, the end of the last ice period has also been accompanied by greater seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges where on the mainland very frozen parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Modestly CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crutch floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, deferred, as it passes to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This gives that the sliding of tectonic plates, like tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bag, especially since polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in land balance to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am am amused by this "human" saying that the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed Commander, ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he has so separated that he has become harmful, and to himself and to that environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds it in the organization of his very viscera, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking of collaboration, money.
The Earth's crutch is not based on magma, but on the Earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Long live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers now.
Too bad you've never been beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Geladas, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been produced several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to look at a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what it says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, beautifully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self-conforming, in-self, therefore non-conformity.
But Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it was just the premises that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without making it an inexhaustible horizon, is there any relation to the Cartesian approach to examining what one receives to believe, what one believes to be.
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that soaks up: behavioricism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist, it is to fight against this misalignment.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, let's ask some...
Blacks and Rebels, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who see themselves beautified in their mirror.
Thanks in any case to his controversial contestants for putting under the fire of the news Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports the rise in the inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay for the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it will no longer be in power.
Business tips, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has passed the weapon on the left.
Of course, he doesn't want inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are the ones that will most certainly pay the least inheritance tax through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
It will be worth £100 once it has passed the weapon to the left.
Anything.
It will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't choose her last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only accuse him of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the imminent collapse will end it, he and the others of his demise.
His "rich" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Expdionys.
I'm not saying that discipline didactics is unnecessary, of course, I'm just saying that it's insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the teacher of math she was!
Like...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other than quantitative approach.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a relationship of defiance that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => 1 training in skills to teach.
A trade that's learned, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't even get in the equation when we're math teacher!
"Educational sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation in bcp of those who embrace the teachers.
If gifts exist, teaching (I prefer discipline teaching) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
We regret the old Normal Schools of Instituters..
It ends at 3 in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If that's the case, it's all right with his time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It's not my fault!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer and that allows us to listen to broadcasts on demand when we want it!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a usb type adapter at the back of my SKY box and it's connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated to me.
Yeah, I think I cheated on schedule, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 o'clock.
Although it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its broadcast is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a channel like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show in the evening at the return of the job, is not a woman
That's five shows.
So which (of these five) is the most likely to be changed.
Shennan knows that very well, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached these days.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps the full glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get sick or to get rid of it.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have the same parties that alter power and make the keys of the country to the other in less good condition than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't attack, they don't rock, they don't care about politicians...
But don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculturation and ignorance as much as it says that it still has enormous growth potential, it really needs to be bad in order not to have done better...
Today, FN thrives mainly on poverty, fear of everyday life, fear of each other, and feeling that there is no prospect.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and learned to save honour.
They've been looking for her.

Here's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgotten" is actually less and less resource =>low staffing.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being called into question, such as child care and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows us to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't up to it, next time!
The profits make fun of the life you live.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits are derided by heroism and child education.
If it were a crime, the companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women between 20 and 45 years of age.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) should be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows our societies to function and preserve our labor.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who have to "check a house".
The tiger is not Russian, it's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are alone in charge of the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger entitled to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-planned exercises before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You make my day!
Oh, yes, here you are.
I got the same kind of idea right now.
This is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists in order to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into a foolishly directed article against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a sheet on the Siberian tiger, but a sheet on the suites of a com' operation of Putin.
When you expose yourself to the media so much, you also expose yourself to irony or even criticism.
The perpetual victimization return of Soviet-Poutinian sympathizers.
Holland had also taken full of it with its camel without yelling at the anti-French plot.
Here our apprentice, Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of the great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he bar...
Hollande's messing around, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seemed to be a horribly condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to repeat.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty of the sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
In fact - basically, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out right, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue from the Ministry of Social Development to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better means to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a disadvantage in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can bite the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guiness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth the longest and judges Guiness at the time strongly advised him to do so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
I feel like it's a rotten experimental design.
The mere volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrushing would be studied.
This is why most behavioural studies include things like double-blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person with social benefits, there are two things that distinguish this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about the times they brush or brush their teeth (results easily screwed up in the air by people who give their results according to the expectations perceived).
Is there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be passed on to the next generation.
Does the uterus transplant impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that this is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity must not push the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not limitless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have it, or the children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tren
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles alone, alone in your own little pants.
to give them this magic bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it sterilely in my safe if he could still give love.
The current strict circumstances make PR FRYDMAN careful on its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
Let us put as an anti argument: cf here these reactions all male curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally anodine.
I had registered as a spindle donor (I was never selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one way or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: indeed, it has nothing to do with it, and it strengthens the act of love that involves it.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have an anodin either, and that is done!
Please don't combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's really no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo became a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning title team.
Thank you for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season to be able to then return to Old Trafford this summer with a tranquil conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the state of the international oil investment society?
I was looking at it on a shit connection so I can't tell you much if it's just that Valencia has defended and without counting possession, they deserve to win.
I was afraid the field wasn't getting over too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's game as a whole gets better.
A terrible penalty released but rightly saved by Diego.
A hot messalla and it didn't have to be funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archaeology 524 of September last.
It's a good idea to have arguments to confirm and date what we get intuitively.
It's no wonder before we get complicated we've made it simple.
Every science progresses by step.
And "The organ" of the woman who was thus preserved to him was?
Lovely!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a black child mummy had been discovered in present Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think it was 1,000 years before the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information on this?
Thanks in advance.
She's a little awkward about reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Did the desert at the time extend less than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to say it, even without any evidence, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so the Africans from yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "of his ill-known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by free market neoliberal quacks who preach against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola and whom the Spanish government is lying to us, so as not to give oneself a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very touristy place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to return the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air military base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis of power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right wingman in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far to his right and would find his place to the mad right-wing religious in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European right-wing party to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government has almost everything to do with it.
It's not like someone can accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE bosses - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Fr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient age.
A professor of law at the Collège de France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is the Nobel Prize for Economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé saw the work of children aged 8 and 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were shot in sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah, the good old time...
Your reaction is equally fascinating because of your ignorance of the TPE's employer trade!
His job is not to know the right in all its ways, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscript amounts on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is one example, much more could be mentioned, which illustrates the permanent flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which suffocate the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to twist the neck to the archival-ressourced argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code compared to the grasshopper, a serious scholar would have plunged into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts, and then the comments (the absence of the latter could mean that Swiss laws are more comprehensible than ours).
For comments in a Code, whether it's from work or not, the case law applies in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is dismissed, for example...
Who's complicated??
Do you find that the rules of law (law, case law, agreements, contracts) are in the field of labour and trade in unbearable barriers?
What's he doing?
How long does that take?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It's probably time that new revolutionary absurdities bring criticism...
For every article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Get on with something else!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not Communist Party spokespersons, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are Communist government spokesmen are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it had to be displayed at all costs (without making a bad word).
It's the guy who bursts out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
True artists make a difference.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an election mandate the extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayor.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, marginally.
WHO IS REMEMBERED TO BE
What does the City Hall of Neuilly expect to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is suffering an injurious journalist and his family, and who is publicly calling for this urbanist to attack?
Crime apology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ???
This type needs care, in the same way as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel plot and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
In the same way as many people believe in any political decision the hand of " Zionists" (the term whose meaning tends to disappear, due to its abuse), these two, in the same title as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even trivial, an abject antisemitism "which is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the belly of the beast my good lady would have returned to Russia in the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of a much craziness.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the September 11 conspiracy theory, we talk about cognitive dissonance on how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the support of this theory to detach itself (as in the case of extreme religious).
Then a logic and ineluctable escapes forward, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is a combo, but it seems not to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that is what you do for the 11th of September.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are actually very farfetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow !!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what requires (a little) more effort, is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining.
The government will put an end to the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should come together (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're gonna tax them like smokers!
They do it already - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm gonna keep drinking my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife isn't here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer today ???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
He refuses to run when we could run and reciprocally.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To both of them, they destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or at least Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but pay attention to point number 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the departure so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly accurate, +1
I would just like to wish you a quick and quick recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that have failed to occur between crash cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How could the race organisation and the FIA have allowed these manoeuvres without exiting the safety because?
I can't accept that we can invoke the risks of the trade or the fault at no chance when we haven't prevented the foreseeable one.
But that was the accident.
It must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which means not only "the prohibition to exceed in the area" but has the first purpose of pointing out a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their foot.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trapping the turn after and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can get even at "low" speed compared to a normal pace.
But well, we cause in the vacuum there, as long as we haven't seen the images, we won't be able to issue an opinion.
I don't see much of what changes.
Are there any injuries?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where we need to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals such as bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and the Toronto population has at least six million inhabitants.
In Saskatchewan's countryside, trains do not derail as a charm, and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the roads often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass in densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic passes through the centre of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a story about it last night, really shocking.
You obviously haven't read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railway Society are expected to attend the next Conference on Hazardous Products in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of hazardous products.
This article, like many comments, ignores the primary religious issue: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there is no other truth.
The whole problem is there, and the exigencies of theologians only reinforce this fact, or what good is it to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim countries but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"

May His Nullesque Appendix touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way by trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather pale at this moment) or that of the free market (possibly supported by the state when it is necessary to swell) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious origins.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where rationality emerges, the religious is at the trailer and expresses himself in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods served ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
The theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time does not know the doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a poor interpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit pleas to the hate of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate (and fortunately the most) religious who read the texts "wrongly" and retain only what belongs to humanism and the values common to all humanity, atheists and diverse believers.
For me, fanaticism is the wicked and wicked application of passages of sacred texts from their context.
Thus, some of the Koran's verses calling for the killing of "medicants", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of self-defence.
on Yves Petit:" concerning the "furard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous among the "savanes".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same injury as the one shown in the clip?
Overpaid and hypersexualized Neanderthal Band.
They have outraged humanity enough!
What did they bring us frankly besides having insulted us with The neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still an inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The remarkable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to take a different view.

But what about Marié Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most awesome.

Nice effort, Savantcosis!
But you don't know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegraphist who has nothing but his days to do.

Almost all of the 331 people killed since the ceasefire are civilians from Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to elements uncontrollable according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritical responsibilities suggested in the article without dare to go until explicitly designate separatists is in the otanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European gentile neo-Nazis bravely facing the evil Russians
@SavantCosinus: change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your speech, the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
Alexandre Kastals: where do you keep these details regarding the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
Alleeeeeez la Romania!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the authorities in place who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativa", which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder the money at his will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was misinformed by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him an unpunished sentence), and thus took three and a half years in prison.
The trial also took place from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also takes a penalty for trying to bribe (and subsequently conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championship, to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to sweat were our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always taste that much.
In concealing this attempted corruption, Piturca was involved, among other things, in signing as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, stupid, cheating, lying guy doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist idiots today.
You might think that after the last time they broke out of stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take the realms back to Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County refused.
Super article.
If it was Sarkozy who had done this, we would have heard the left scream like a big sick man.
But as is the kind Hollande, friend of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but all down
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer a party complaining of the left to settle in power.
It is the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not been deprived of their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (not how)
Should employment policy generalize the control of the unemployed at the beginning of 2015?
I hope that in the scourge, the fiscal pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the rulers commonly known as plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a sentence without the words banksters or ploutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we have the class: we treat the population of literates and toothless people.
At each new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even accused of being admitted to reception.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support by Pole Employment.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" patronym of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article from the chain duck?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have led to the removal of people who, for more than half of them, were no longer affected by unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how control can be done of people we never see.
It is wondered which penalty is a penalty for someone who does not have access to employment centres or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform will allow for further removal, one wonders how it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football as well?
Should we hunt them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain economic.
The goal is not to be a "Police of Thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It makes no economic sense.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality ???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by corrupt Mafia arbitrators, UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this rotten lucrative organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what's Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Removed from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would it be hoped that small symmetrical phrases would be retorted, just a story of maintaining controversy?
In any case, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there was, there are and there will be people who are trying to throw oil on the fire.
Decodage would be to say that the Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israeli and that only explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli State.
Decodage would be to say that to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the overarmed Israeli identity State occupying the siege of the oppressive colonialist destroyer.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Let's take the example of the settlement of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But as for Israel, we also need to question history, its allies, and its supporters in order to see the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaul was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli State defines itself as that of a "Jewish people", of which no non-Jewish can be a part.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jews, hence the contentious.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jewish.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized from the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that must cease to be ignored.
First of all, the Zionist European project (colonising the Palestinian ownership) involved dispossession of Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Secondly, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay was missing biting from the start.
Their tender result will give them what their fingers bite from.
He should start his rehabilitation with small plugs.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite for the game.
So many subtleties are tolerated, including racial insults and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yes, I hate all these molarizers.
Football is a contact sport where the heels exist and so the players will hurt themselves.
The fact of getting his teeth into the flesh of an adversary for the advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for a similar gesture.
This is now the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would the consequences be to you?
I knew someone was going to die.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm slightly dyslexic indeed.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back and playing with his teeth.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their biter.
I almost got bitten by the hook.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect of the students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents teach that respect to their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their teachers and their children's schools.
In the good institutions those, who make progress their pupils, parents are considered partners, not emm.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together briefly) It is parents to do at least 50% of the rate.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Putting on the parents is not operational.
No one really took them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could have a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be wrong for the actors (profs, hierarchies and ministry) to play their role and not to be constantly involved.
We can dissolve a band that is disbanded to revive it, not the families.
How can we not talk about teaching?
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's first role.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if there is a parent's requirement, it is that the school provides training for their children.
Which minister would dare to put in place what was called Public Instruction.
Disappointed article: little information, partial and destroyed reflections.
Did you really expect a smart comment from this beau of the eastern suburbs?
It's beautiful, it's clear, but I think he's more of Willoughby, and so of the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let it fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
directly true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Effectively a beaver on the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He passes for a grunt today.:(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on his hunger.
You would be rather bitter if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illegal benefits for life will forever be beyond your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then abandoned it.
At least he's not threatening to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fear of the result.
And so much for employment in France that it has nothing to do, it emanates from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses in the markets, especially outside...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work that the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the marpol deadline or arrangement, no doubt the project would have succeeded.
After that, to know if it's right or not and how BF is going to comply with the law anyway, it would be nice if "the world" leans on it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn tax and drought centers.
They want state aid.
That they don't seem normal to me.
Well to the extent that armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to expect a coup d'état.
Or then we condemn ourselves to allowing the British to monopolize the market.
It's a choice.
Eternal French problem that sees its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people are different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short envy.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton flag with crews exclusively made of pure stem Breton.
With that it is certain that they will significantly lower costs...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "hating everything related to the prog", since they just broadcast an hour-and-a-half-hour documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he has had various degrees of participation and pretend to have affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to assemble a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than just a performance, but he didn't get it.
Curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely brilliant, and quite in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary about groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good point.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it ADORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest screams "prejudiced": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a difference of size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misconception of society and his rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuses.
They're defenseless.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr. LeClos.
It is necessary to have the well-disputed mind of the common mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misconception of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, and the vengeance among the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that will never prevail to those who decide wisely of the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
However, in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could be argued that the sentenced person to death, often, had a wild violence, of which he was able to enjoy, against deeply friendly people, who made the costs free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain attenuated with the disappearance of the one who was the bull, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and who haunts their nights.
Let us not disregard their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he has great intelligence.
The heart.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, it was thought to read stories of another time, ancient things, that barbarism of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that clamor, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same for the other two "Excellent American Romanceers" cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all perfect.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that funny about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is incommensurably better than this painful Bellow, who received him the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we should have an American winner, we could still have a racist [leger].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His fellow Joseph, on the other hand...
Who did you read?
How many books did DeLillo's anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll end up in Underworld someday.
I just know that if I meet someone who pretends to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's just interest.
It was a trait of humor, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in HIS sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution that she represented, that we wonder what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it'll take a lot of money!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not warn him of the danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for tranquility.
Inundable areas that become constructible from day to day when a large construction program is going to start, it's classic, not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "today, there are no more floods thanks to the regulatory dams."
Now, you need to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
By land.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer, here, interest?
Take out the calculator and you'll dream of the life you could have been in place of Ms. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Fute sur Mer and former president of the Urbanism Commission, who gives them permission to build!
The two triophant Sarkozysme nipples are the old and the real estate.
I'm on the left and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, no low politics or low blows all azimuths, we're not in there in a fight of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. police are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what fucking hole do you live in?
The U.S. is not a shithole.
Yeah, U.S. cops are hardened because of the roots they're dealing with every day.
Of course, none of them ever do anything, but the cops "come and fuck 'em because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that such an incident is needed to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
The good cops must denounce the corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've had a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's you who clearly don't pick anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not osive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is rising in this respect at this point.
And therefore, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in various ways, so the treatment underwent by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the people responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
Let man go to Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is cross-checking, verification, analysis.
And that's where we understand that the sarcolottes are concerned about each other.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of antisarkozysm-based mounted business of any piece (a place and no condemnation) that seems to have been concocted by magistrates(2 correctional referrals), two journalists friends of Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is your partisan mind that blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is coincidence and not guided !!! ...
If you think Sarkozy's only support is outraged!
From the extract I read, VA's article just sprays the sprayer.
I even laughed at it so much it was rude.
For the rest, the World's complaint has little chance of ending because journalists are not "stricted" to the secret of sources, is it not?
The difference is that there seems to be no agreement between VA and power, while there seems to be agreement between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are well faced with a state scandal which in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
Hence this publishing house with boises, which says a long time about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I would have thought the eye would be good with the smoked herring!
It is simply for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said that she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, even refusing to give dinner oats simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she told her that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't comfortable"
As we all know, if we allow it to be done, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a director of pub :) Much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to fit well the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-east-permit, the politically correct one that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a centre left and not a communist, I said this to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Drop your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of leftist politics, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done, which is especially right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah, that's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are now coming to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do it.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another distature, that of the money.
We'll make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
Or, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still has a meaning in Europe, should it not?
Curiously, the Commission does not address unfair tax competition between the countries concerned with companies.
This must be negligible quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to fully market the rail transport sector.
This means that whole portions of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of which many territories have already suffered will only be strengthened.
To sacrifice everything, including the advent of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be dealt with properly one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clear the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions feel that they pay for nothing, but they do not have the means to force the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential in our days when public resources are forced.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be a wolf leader?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to an end of the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense to start the process of separation between your life and the complications you have inherited.
Looks like it's what they do, but it seems hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones are surfaced, have you thought about a "plan" of "fleet" so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He seems vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide support to help her resume work and pay for maintenance.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Warn them that he will not necessarily have his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will deal with disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their own good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuous relationship father/child, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things on their own.
Go another little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
It is folded, within 30 to 40 years civilization has disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
In addition, with globalization, the country that does in the least so-called social, fiscal, but also environmental advantage immediately has a competitive advantage, and the others are forced to follow.
All policies seek is growth, Growth.
International coordination would be necessary, but by now...
It is not the climasceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who is heating up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live housing that has had to be built, those who buy industrial products that they have had to produce and transport.
It is not the climasceptics that have shown against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climasceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climasceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.) is also needed.
And politicians act in part on the sensitivities of their electors.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise by McArtur made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it's about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo du Guardian: How long before anyone puts the blame on immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the skull that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I'm putting the blame on the Democrats' liars.
Or the Democrats' crooks.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump in a car or plane to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.

He hired Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Oh, shit!
Don't use the word immigration, you're gonna scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year from hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating and eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a dick.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is that a (bad) joke or is it not done on purpose?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend time in space making triggers and rumbling while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So TV reality has not invented anything and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to brighten media coverage to Western royalties used to Tabloid maternityes.
They may have to go down to the ground to see that we work here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, men or women are not sent into space to make triggers or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful to mankind in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily lives are derived from space research.
So, yeah, it's money spent really well.
You can mention one thing that improves our daily life and comes from space research.
It's just a beret.
The ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treatments?
To participate in the manufacture of a whole useless product?
Or suggest how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the emptiness itself.
Ah if the last play high tech.
Behind the infamous minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make that possible.
You know, people who work, including more and more private companies, especially to drive the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking of buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think to buy plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to misunderstand people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic pictures of "swords in plastic" ?
Or even to be curious enough to ask yourself what was meant by the inscription (if any) that was on it?
Bad typical report, we're looking at the fact that "it's just a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jihadi text that's written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to bring down the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be mortal.
Even the small blankets that are given in the fast remains can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated actually support its argument.
I saw on occasion these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and who was handing out plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful new features, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worst cost, a considerable cost (subscription, electrical consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows you to isolate the tables of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses were so isolated this year!
Interested in this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can appeal to it and how it works?
for information 60 million consumers, testing water-saving showers and recommending the use of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce their water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a crisis of demand, it is a system crisis that no longer produces enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed in real terms in the form of income increase) so that these excesses pay for the increase in expenditure you are classified as "compulsory expenditure".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy is no longer growing as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that could force, increasingly decades after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows for any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is this allows to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any increase in energy production (unlikely called energy production), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn, forces production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precariousness and whether or not we are going to grow the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be worsened in the years and decades to come (the EIA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that conventional oil production peaks, including cheap oil have been achieved in 2008.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high density of energy, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back, so it's equalizing things.
Take it from France!
Vote No 18.
Are you a Guardian's webmaster?
As previously noted: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
That's good work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scots when they just lose, there is nothing to say, they bring some color to tournaments when they come to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the "golden Shige" generation retires, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 1 1 th off, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class," is David Beckham, a bit effeminate, perhaps, but I believe that if he tackled a potato in excess weights like me, it would crush me completely.
People forget their athletic constitution, in fact, talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney... ?
I never laugh at Scots.
I tend to be surprised watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the night...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class" is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's about Juppe having a hard time asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people are coming to make a good laugh?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputies' allowances...
I am particularly concerned about what he can say in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will consider asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free of charge or almost.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their conferences - free of charge - are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is meaningful.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all clear for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like we blame him for making money???
I am far from being one of his fans, but that he is reproached for having wrong (or fraudulently) managed his campaign OK.
But holding conferences seems to me to be quite a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule No. 1: Isolating.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than the politically correct.
He is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane to Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is getting worse in West Africa, I can see them banning all flights and ships to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What a shame it is that the panic of the international media about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all under threat.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's such a sad newspaper article, so big a title.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first providers of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and the gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get in there, think about it, and write, we're not just making noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you're not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think about it before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as beheading - a form of just as barbaric terrorism, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - says that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case it obviously does not give better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "maturating" as a world resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, let that look like it?
For a territorial or other election, the money does not count.
I read constantly that the territorial civil service increases its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, to us to separate the good grain from ivory.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic miseries.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficit they have funding needs that can only concern and only the investments they make.
Through the use of concepts too vague the press as the World makes the game of all the obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-recruitment of civil servants (for example, to make nice roundabouts) carries a growing and incomprehensible burden (compulsory charge until death, since life + retirement work), these communities are cutting into investments.
Staff Regulations should therefore be deleted, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also hold the mayors responsible financially.
It's fabulous, the intercoms would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the communal workforce and it's the opposite that happens, proof that adding one step is not effective without deleting the others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is up to date, perhaps it would be time to react.
No, they'd rather be jailed, the worst nailed, in the administrative web, it would seem!
Let's even try the claws, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of Vème led with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then he went on to finish the "suffle-end" series coming up loud about.
Why won't they live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco over a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Do not even try the answers of the kind "it is the fault of the whites".
"response" not "response"
I really hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to get through.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa approximately 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly wet period approximately 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to hold the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resign!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of gold closets for future retirees of the Republic ?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the wise and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military are going to treat the flu of the last little one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all backgrounds?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outward travel for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had a bad time being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did not favor us.
I love supporting Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a good supporter and which until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but that must be a good gif.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South-East sure to follow them from afar or will they now have to support another team?
Good pro-domo article and good extension.
But who cares?
But then, why NOT ALL computer systems are based on these concepts ???
+because a giant mass of programs preexists (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is to be the first in the segment.
The work of G.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been in an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has decreased.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to salt in the future.
It looks like they're reasoning with Faisons more profits, and don't make healthier dishes and the best price ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yes, be careful that people don't have too much fat.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would also be good to add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It's not just the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to business kitchen.
Are there any family restaurants and offer tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A random job accident that went wrong.
A young promising man, learned thief, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man screwed up and brutally interrupted this vocation.
That he be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree!
What a mood!
The desire to discover it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to discover it is difficult to excuse it.
That's why I have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial the boy's father complained of never seeing his son again but without asking forgiveness to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who really is the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The kid's father was convicted of what he did.
As for the mess of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty knew exactly how dangerous the bullets are.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime he's responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little bit of my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make a noise?
Actually, it made a noise!
If the occasion occurs, go on holiday in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I've done it twice, the wine, the landscape and the food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
However, rather important, German winegrowers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience various grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not that the Moselle region that must be recommended - the Franconie, the Palatine Rhine (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of German style (or perhaps it is the opposite, brief).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot of them, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle to the property are so complex, the gentleness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatle with a hot lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great, superbly illustrated guide.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of the time.
From time to time, there is an article about German wines that are coming, the new dries of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the red ones that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (he, I don't really think it is always true or evocative, unless I address myself to the more than 40 years - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Gracia would be an enormous mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these shams of ministries held by the barbershop, and these decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
As in Sunil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Moreover, meat could be resold that will feed our poor (sic) assets because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find jobs for our unemployed, for real work, and you won't have any more deficit problems!
For the elderly, it has come time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, in the process of disappearance, will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So of the geriatrics, of course, but to think differently than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (it has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole post-war model!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain degree of rigour and discipline that is best known in public hospital.
If that symbol falls we're really fucked up.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than at the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the offer of public service in other hospitals than to maintain two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of medical excellence in France, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospital day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Hospitalization Regional Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country from two non-citizens parents is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born of Australian residents of citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why????
It seems to me to be doing two weights two measurements.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all persecution and ill-treatment and war that drive people away from their country and force them to come and seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during the civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country is back to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little super-cheer when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott...
Cameron denounced the crimes of war and the abuse that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils related to the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with TTE-related relationships be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by groups of Buddhist activists against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've been given the coconut so periodically.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
I didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given year treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah !!!!!!
There is still little, we were told that ebola kills so quickly that a massive epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagious people being taken was zero.
It's weirder we're more comfortable, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or too weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific fact, the more a virus is fatal rapidly (in general) the less likely it is to spread as the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After that is the forty general to save mankind..
There is nothing obscene about mediating certain brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African ills whose profession, bravery and virtues are unknown?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but repetition of the announcements is a terrifying bias.
The freedom of expression, so loved by the conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative penchants would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem is actually out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Future Markets Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would probably only be a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Future Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "liest rodent" and Telstra's Final Market Fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty...
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destiny for a career-end policy: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her town of Toul as being sufficient to administer it.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We live in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I am against the port of burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdote tells is pure sarkozism: poor tiny ministers, confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each road access to show that he is well guardian of public order), rudeness and excessness carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become unemployed from carrying a firearm and badge, so they would have all the pleasure of exercising their self-proclaimed function as vigilantes.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the blow
Don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we'd have to invent it!
It's easy though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On that occasion, N.
Morano obviously made in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had before her, and who probably had to multiply the curves and the "Yes, of course Madame, right away, tell me Madame in which direction I must run to seize me without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air strike on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis is going to get over them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone counted the bodies now nobody here is doing it.
In terms of industrial civilian deaths, nothing rivals the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, older persons and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions to defer the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsiderately in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time to mark their main enemy when they saw him, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and hard as this bombing is, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Good point, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths from Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only figures even vaguely reliable on death related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to see the facts.
It was, of course, in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400 000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not worth better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course we need to fear her, but also the gift of gametes in general.
It is necessary to stop acting as though people were pure spirits, that love was all the children needed, and that they could be done with unknowns that neither the parent nor the child would ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantasistic arguments, we should be told what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or designed with gift games.
If you learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the games you came out of, you could put them back, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in LDCs (e.g., uterus transplant) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed MPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire of children justify these acrobats and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Just like a point.
It is obvious that we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
Of all life's concerns, it's not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes a good consumer, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The child's desire is not a whim where one can use the other according to his or her own will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
