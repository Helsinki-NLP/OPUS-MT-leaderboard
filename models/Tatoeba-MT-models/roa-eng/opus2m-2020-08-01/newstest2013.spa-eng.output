A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And on the same line, a majority of American governments enacted new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult from 2009.
This phenomenon has expanded following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, during 2011, 180 bills were introduced restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the period of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of polling and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
Therefore, the republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs over a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's more.
In many states students, the voters who most vote for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that undermined the registration of voters on the same day of the poll in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction in the period of advance voting.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same thing.
These represent only 11 per cent of the electors, which amounts to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, targets, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men doubt, already reluctant of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be done.
Do you have the test or not?
We have asked for advice from two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a large rate of infection among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study, for its part, showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been diagnosed and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40 per cent of possibilities for metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, in which case one should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they say.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they raise the risks of colorectal cancer.
Packaging products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salad may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"Making the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's about the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear what it's about Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we're assuming this is about Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be few, and we'll see what this is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that standard and not try it too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" which consists, in a large way, of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Article Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the months, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosnes, I might stress here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge speeds up or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of yours "power bearers".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN (the big Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself at the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can you bring" all these investigations? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, has still enormous shortcomings, as it proposes no explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are mistaken in saying that it will have none.
To see: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
Scientific applications were interspersed, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered rather a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which was valued by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but it is never known...
The best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within this essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two-year breath.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've been seven," he relates, made a pass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused damage to him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, you even smile, talk to strangers who give you attention, bring you medicines, and offer you a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing up," reports Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer the "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made your children discover.
"I have some good children," he says.
"I don't have any more wishes in this life," she says, before I accept a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a final visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered by brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, which died during the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer," concerns Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
Seventy-seven percent of Canadians simply lack access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate its opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don't get the proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are opposed to their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when he left out exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was so sorry I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"But she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the sick who claim to die thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the disease will have the possibility of having such palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day by day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
A "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted the great media," ironies Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former Chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the misdemeanours of road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate existing stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interventioners, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works for police officers from the "Marteau Squadra", who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "squattle of sewerage" moderate when inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has made a series record of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his seat as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambio, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambio distributed money to disbursed people during the 2000s, granting over $88,000 (about 68,000) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he had inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate bills between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking at a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arks.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will eventually be carried out, she asserts that she pulls "out of a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but a clean research unit would be needed in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned above all about the role of '"elected politicians aware of the stratagem".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was devoted to funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, it ironics: "I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he says, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "we cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story obscures the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look into the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players are here.
I advance from day to day next to him.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I'm not slowing down.
From my beginnings in INF Preformation Centre Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to vigorous steps.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting high-level matches.
They know that each training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
It is supported by deputies like Claude Makeelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eight finals in style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league in front of the Port so we can receive the return of the eighth of the end.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for the implementation of this project.
Wouldn't win the Cup on League 1, as in the last season, make a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts to take that title as champions.
In the last season, we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a tough time.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to carry it for us.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home at Troyes, they still encounter things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to rank for the eighth of the end, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "incited" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
Better to say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he targets many goals.
He's here to prove he's the Star of League 1.
And he has shown on all the teams he's been through, he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the Euro Cup 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got back up.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and it is because of this that we have exemplary behaviour today.
What view do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the classification group for the World.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The quote of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to round the ten dollars (quotations are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even sometimes swap).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositories of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which is spread across the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
This is a phase of file slices, i.e. a transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "trocear" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept only one of the two transactions as valid; the other would stay orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the 100th millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculus power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites that offer Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in storage.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash presents the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject this kind of payments.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of Bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant discounts" were launched.
"30,000 dollars have been changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who assures he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to push, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to return to possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting any of us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek or Tajiks.
Tolerable, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no flow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants overstepped by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahidines, the present government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Sovian war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government lands to sell them as solar for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the escape from capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Sovian struggle are already concerned about rebuilding the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has reestablished its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing occurs except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth spread.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the land and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the vast Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain localities.
Such work, avid to obtain local labor, has been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in those valleys which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, they would need to maintain a small civilian aid, well-controlled and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as regards the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used an interim text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial bottlenecks.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "treason his word" and "pisote the law".
By their supporters, it is ensured that it is a measure to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time requiring the Brothers to renounce their draft explanation of the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote on my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist largely, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I had hoped, the articles voted were unanimously adopted.
The commentators are also grateful that one of the few discrepancies of the day was practically expressed at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all looks, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals view it as hypocritical and consider it nothing more than an artifact of advertising.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular to anyone who has to confirm its compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the present one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of civil status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked in this text are not Ulemas but university students, some of them formed in the French system," Alexis Blouet explains, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule over all of this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil prosecutions in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will also not be prohibited.
They also expressed concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive step has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of State protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are expected by the Holy Land, the World's Obligatory and a Sea of Salmura
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why one should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk here through the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Way of Pain").
It begins in the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the anointing and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian ombudsman of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And getting there by their own means, they can only those who devote themselves to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Up to there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposed to dwell on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judaea, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and categorically no donations are accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they ring the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative clays and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
She passed through the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "mesmo" symbol, fortune will be in your favor.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a quick tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There you will find a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chick, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their taste" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of cars parked.
The rummers love the crowded places and do not reject the sweets.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will leave you for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting to 51 per cent at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While parliamentarians and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the mandatory review law, the country has already emerged as a "false" trader.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, according to which each worker must carry out an examination to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to give the language review, except also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law will not be subject to persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examining centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to test themselves in all cities, and more than 160 such centres are open right now in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the Duma Members and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: What will this really bring about?
What changes will bring about the mandatory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will help solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are caused by immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid journey" to a spooky and narrow cow, where he and dozens of others like him consume themselves for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Immigration Directorate of Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because your families even have nothing to feed the children, not to talk about clothes, shoes and buy them what they need for the school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties themselves.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we're not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred roubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, commented to journalists.
"Come on, don't be a jerk, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was made clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be purchased, converge between government officials and rights defenders.
Until now, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have passed the examination for the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
Moreover, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with recorded weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigorously with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting shots during wedding celebrations where there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, where seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organisations of shooters, demand that such measures of "no senselessness" be waived.
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, commented at BBC news service in Russia, criminal counsel Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months in 2012, 142 offences were committed using firearms registered in internal organs, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be a drawback for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factory to official
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, "arms of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," said one ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their granite sand.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Lots of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explained.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the arms stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some pincers, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so regularly, when the crime discovery plan has to be implemented, they make test purchases to illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who offered me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where he would be a man who would take me to a "skin" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't really trust him."
In the markets there are sellers, but there must also be arrived, let's say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to delay him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was prepared to be published.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there wasn't "anything."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer cat for hare: everything there is can be proved.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to websites and groups of "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No document or personal encounters are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy gun TT. Moscow," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms by hand.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets states that if an online order is made, one will lose his weapon and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms by hand.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It must wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by middle-ranking leaders.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7%, which is 22.900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the Walmart Corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and fall in love in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart's workers and those of the fast-food system, the objective of the protest organizers is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, it co-ordinated the orgy of discards that captured millions of people, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers from the Walmart Corporation, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside the left-wing trade unions and activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the two critical words, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low price, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about bad working conditions, such as the lack of hand-held mounts or scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the event demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
California University scientists in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12$ per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in their stores from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight on the following day and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the left-wing Huffington Post website, that they left their jobs "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had only been "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not precisely the great Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there is no one), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and by average, regular workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonalds and worked there, behind the exhibitors, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that unions of workers be created in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main issues is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democrats politicians participated, in particular the Municipal Council member of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast-food workers in order to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not that easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology fans, has recently been generally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference he demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the appropriate patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group's study?
- We dedicate ourselves to personal-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
We must free the world from computer science to our physicists, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, you're about to solve the privacy issue, because you don't always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have complaints about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the currents of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the transmitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the signal reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an enhanced reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics usually point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that increased reality is the seventh rupture in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in image support.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of your fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Has he tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what it seems like I should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to struggle for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not that easy, it is still necessary to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even getting to know them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they show themselves.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical accountants of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguard of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Even though in society, anything that is not a bit grey provokes aggressiveness and agitation of property nothing good.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of unofficial old artists had finished, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not the lyrics.
It was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought to the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything gets embroiled and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one follows it by the clothes, orienting externally, but not within the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't be given a hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
We've seen you recently in the role of an urban organizer.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but can commercial art be nice at best?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to like everybody.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come in for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, there's the sex-social sphere.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 people will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is broken.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young he made such pictures that a collector had them hanged on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is one concept: a cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right things were the other way, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because experts are needed at a higher level that properly assess these and open the way for them.
He is now flourishing the subjective personal taste.
The same Errata, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is minimal.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth to space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board start in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Chief Investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproductive problems in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of pots grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophilas.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops in pregnant conditions.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they did not find support, the chickens gave random turns.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
Chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chickens to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the spatial rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction in outer space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot achieve their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviote flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted who after long flights everything worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov sums up.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the Cosmonauts Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child is its native element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside her mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only spend 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, it is necessary for women to gravitation, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvis muscles are decrepit very quickly, the ejection capacity of the foetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this one will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear in a special training suit, such as for adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will give rise to bringing to Earth a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.
Head of NKU: Inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the matter of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is consistent.
So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack," describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has an obligation to carry out such controls nor require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of control at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
It is simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by praxis itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet been completed, we have achieved very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", however, concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring about? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing in law enforcement, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the invitations to tender means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to look for system failures can do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, like the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BHR) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like making these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we are modeling must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't be of any benefit to collaborate with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is it in any way apparent its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, a certain delay is needed.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", whereby we have passed almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or rather a blunder for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation is "hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the matter of public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it then make sense to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we will do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the regulation is fairly strict as to how formal action should be taken, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate should be excluded with the best offer not to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are transitable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are passable, caution should be extreme in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and oscillates between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
In contrast, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still bad due to fog, according to information from the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The fast R6 road and the first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially in some bridges whose surface may be frozen and to be resbalded.
In addition, all second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still traces of frozen snow and ice.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové region
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of ice cream and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports the Road and Highway Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the Krkonoše mountain roads to Orlické hory.
There is a snow layer nested in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
The temperatures will usually fluctuate between three below zero and one positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although care must be taken and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent decrease in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information of the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme precaution, especially on the track between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be frames with ice plates.
The second and third category routes are wet, so in this case it is also warned of sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be partially snowed.
After the chemical treatment, it was still snowed in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers took off the snow during the night; on Šumper's road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Šumper Road, there are snow debris left.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-waste snow towards Jeseník," confirmed today a operator of the road administration of Šumper to ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also went to Jesenická, their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks in the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitable without restrictions, in the Šternberská road drivers should drive carefully in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different sections at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. However, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Central Czech Mass, there are no problems and roads, usually, are dry.
There have been no service complications for the memo.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from general roads on road I/13, at the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to build up positive energy
It is said that within less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group rather likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It's a state-of-the-art charity that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the previous day, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "The End of the World, Cancelled."
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear at beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it will be the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with even other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money collected at the concerts be devoted to against the end of the world?
A equipment for the Studeo barrier-free educational centre, which we complete in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkćv usutav.
The students at the Jedličkýv school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkשv usutav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and interpreters operate at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any similar "wonderful action" planned in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of us in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it might seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to departures abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that in the east there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in wheelchairs in elevators, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that is working to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects that we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the persons to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their own in public and can go to service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change everything really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkשv usutav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La la la Angelovič says, we left a little bit of our hands (laughs).
However, popularity hasn't reached the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be teachers of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of spectacles is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its way, that everything new is cautiously welcomed and takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and who we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works for people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and require certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to practice, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and desires will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without STUDEO barriers in Jedličkýv usutav in Prague, the cost of which amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of ESA of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during subsequent years participated in the Agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Award and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a Dresina was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the beginning of the dresin or for its braking.
The information on this Dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation came to the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was discontinued.
In 1937 the prototype of a photo-hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Comitét Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronomical Federation.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and launched for the first time on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959, the two-stage RM-2 rockets were air-tested in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was about four feet [1.4 m] tall and weighed about ten pounds [11.5 kg].
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the social labour law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This means, therefore, that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a decline" of the competitor's price in order to make itself with most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, to buy there cheaper or to disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily increases.
All this gives rise to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital decree, especially in terms of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, food delivery points have existed in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people who receive this kind of help is now up to the million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to get to the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public concerning the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The measures of saving virtually all the states in the south of the EU lead, without doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to mallive with a bad wage within the limit of society, with the hope that someday they will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask yourself where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the extent of satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by getting into control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march with its selfishness and hence throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation such as the one described by Appianmos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations occupied themselves with force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and aid to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without hindrance, and people came to the polls with the pre-fabricated vote"... "there were no people of a character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a grave situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeya, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into an autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that the present society is based on unconsidered preferences of the individual benefit without taking account of the common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really demoralizing fact is that the present elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could happen," Sting in his song Fragile and whose streak reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (we don't forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defence and encapsulates the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and stains Israel with a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the killings that are repeated on a regular basis and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small land area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or group of people is the main driver of modern history's events.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
At each time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach one generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being waged: prior to the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the Iraq attack there were 5, after overthrowing Gadafi only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who's tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the War of Secession to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
His zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of triggering crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of the First World War, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflict situation following the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were sufficient to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent so well the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population in Palestine.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much from the rope that the international bankers had tied to at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If international bankers managed to start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the front line, now with the Arab population or, generally, a Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within your country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel's supporters and detractors are tasingly divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice create injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare the war on Iran and, considering Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
What light is now shown by David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will be in accordance with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And it forces all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or front, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students protested took up the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation offered no positive prospect: to throw the Shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats in prison were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animating against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which had a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped a covert story with an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were interpreted in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men brought in who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been ridiculed, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action is not taking place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "runs" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive due to its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of uncertainty and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they are quite well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn't all come out so elegantly (the scene in which it watches the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track become a madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it goes down, that'll be hard.
As an evoking of a real history and as proof of the exaggerated that may be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services, it is enough.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which presents a survey every year on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40% share of women in leading positions in large European companies," explained Provo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities appointed is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women had a better price in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Another incredible ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in egg prices this year.
The factual prohibition of using the expression "untar butter mantle" or the removal of the classic bulb from the trades has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission has argued that this only seeks to harmonise un homogenized national rules so far, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement last year that in the inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxia.
A similar restriction applies also to the use of masuegras by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Fare, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as we entered the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies.
This kind of idea emerged not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of cereal in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often critical, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to a number of experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also touched by the sensitive fibre, as is the case with other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always come out victorious of these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc petition, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemak".
Only products produced from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the apples of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected EU seas, they can be proud of Pardubice ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how did it happen to you to present yourself to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer stand to see how he steals in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, taxes and retirement age increase.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out for the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I had to say that if I was elected as a senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which depresses and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists what I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
It must change the law for that purpose.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to fix it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby for the guidance profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether on the right or on the left, they are rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without any match or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it considered rather a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care about is we move on.
I don't care if someone's on the right or on the left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, similarly, I will be against bad ideas.
He's joking when you're told he's populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he's saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, it is only recorded.
And it cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you talk to and talk to people, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they do not want to.
If there is a strong character that points to the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I claim that I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years' time I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate there are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the unattainable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money or for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, a flat worth ten million, another floor charged in eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth in one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Does an Aston Martin drive, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor demonstrates that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses cover essentially what I will receive as Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live from it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business to be able to live?
Didn't you say before you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would like me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I was president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and ebooks.
No one goes by the way in those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented in euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was decided by the political leaders that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for funny buildings as well as cynics, took the theme with its usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked puzzled around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books by Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and town buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little town lacking history, which so far had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian postmodern area and an incredibly ugly city after whose white facade one would intuit rather a dairy center, now has a contemporary architectural work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is a lift that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography every step of their climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the recycled brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys playing football.
And for both books, books and more books.
"The bookshelf shelves are usually available along the facade and in the centre there is a huge dark room that usually is rather uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put our feet up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch, and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, on a Frisian farm, we encounter the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of scarce millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of the crops.
It is cheap and efficient.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was taken, for the first time in such quantities, until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mix and sport slipper.
After 105 footpaths you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also in it you can enjoy delicious Dutch croquetas and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant pair environment that maintains the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large glassed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," Trouborst says.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden brushes located cross-section to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is the thing about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker in the Information Technologies sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Also, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, because of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even if I'm just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in that discipline queen that in the specialized argot is known as the "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated it may be.
Finally, a starting point for conforming your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think that it supports the American stance.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the lifting in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was concerned with establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
Of them they are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy in German terms mean?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not be alienated from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give such importance to you because it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain a certain amount of respect.
After all, all this has done is to prove that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to American domestic policy.
I think the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the politics he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a superior entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany takes its lead, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a far more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a responsive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not currently covering that vacuum, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Market Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name it hides a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not lodge a claim.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The copyists simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats in Beijing's brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in the matter of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of forgeries.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different kind. On the basis of his clients' responsibility, he combats the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of €15 billion per year China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and the one growing at the highest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of suspicious legality registrations in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long since the name that was the subject of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the complainant is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that was recently absorbed by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That's why today Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to Mercedes's star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a blank and blue logo that reminded BMW to a large extent; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usually the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China will lead the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive year, as noted by the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which totals 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been set up for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese copycat in court.
While the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the copymaker has succeeded in securing the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the use of the Muniches.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been right, but the opposite side continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where there is still a resolution.
Wentzler trusts that he can resolve the issue favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite party a "sum of six digits in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
In particular, if copy makers are guaranteed rights on unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this business area, however it has been able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend to German companies that they be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights legislation, but what needs to be done is to "register in China also all that may be likely to be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a mere record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights on his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir and Swaziland are cheering for AIDS orphans.
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), shaking, crumbling and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes almost by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir shows a new song.
The 50 singers, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language hardly known: the zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, around 34 million people are infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school registration, uniform and provide you with a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story narrator" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has been teaching songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the residents of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying over thirty years of age has become a common practice.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this surrounding population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal every day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally involved with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ETS include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Cracks and sarcasm are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact with men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea infections.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to decline since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to a hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections due to dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If they are diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their actions throughout Germany come to raise a lot of money.
"We have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the town itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman secure herself and with leadership abilities manages the money sent from Germany.
It is taken care of that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care that the children go to school every day and dress up in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people of the town have been tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the evidentness of this disease throughout the country, it is not often spoken of openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent, excess-filled lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But it is also because of the countless temporary workers who travel the country from one place to another and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact with skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember about the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but it has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the godfathered children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, the light shines there," the local people say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the pass, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury · Global Voices
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as it emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed an ice layer.
It looks like it's at least 30 centimeters and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that collided with Mercury on its day.
No one relates the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
Findings, however, could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwarranted for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which countless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called unromantically by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This torn image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this stellar formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years away from the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are fluttering to each other to finish collapsing irremediably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation Cepheus.
The 1,400 light-year-old nebula consists of particles of dust between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also constantly new stars; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there's still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and the images they offer have become more and more profound.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope is 305 meters in diameter.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano in Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that in the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first one orbiting Mercury, now scientists are sure it is.
Drinking butter daily and living 168 years

The journey through Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great haste through the winding road passing by forested hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town of which is not known much, apart from which they perfectly dominate the Persian and Azerbaijani and which are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban nuclei, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense only.
The amazing wealth enjoyed by the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have passed the age of 100 years. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the museum's undisputed star is the pastor of Şirali Müslümov sheep, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter over the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov then been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the old age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil registration.
Every day cups filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequent, people in the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum director, Ms Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of the talyshi, who worship meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of which, moreover, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it moves tirelessly a huge butter bowl.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from side to side two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in a typical glass with an abombed form.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark red hair that your son discovers to us proudly.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept her color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never gone shopping at a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells us about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, everything came back to its source when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
It remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, a amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's canoeing son is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The term “Human Rights” is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrious Muslims and seculars.
All of them, unrelenting so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, the approval of which has been forced by a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean "principles"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it carries in order to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
After the dictator's fall up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offensive persons"
Is it enough a cartoon by the president or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to break the Minutes before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who holds third place on the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of the trash of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When the referendum is convened we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been at large," was quoted in the Egyptian media as the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to celebrate a counter-protestation; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi to "clean the country", at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and supporters of the constitution would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the polls what direction the country should take.
In this regard, it seems that the Islamic draft has guaranteed the majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all the social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolishing it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most evil fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success is related to its greed for a highly malolent fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Just leave it there for a week.
It will then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salad trout that is left fermented in water during, depending on how malolient you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captivating.
"He eats raw and then drinks an aquavit glass of a drink," says Harvard Halvarsen, city fireman who is also what is known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
We see people everywhere eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking a large amount of drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different to a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is released and, evidently with inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes it not far richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite malolient, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the friolera of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the event of 22 July".
It is hard for Norwegians to believe that one of their own countries could commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth, the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been found since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while rakfisk trays are going through and, with her long red melon and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While the whole world wasted money that it did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carcassed development.
I'm in the snow making queue to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, it's coming back that mischievous fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated where the diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A TV has been connected live with a presenter who wears a bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovisión competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces a Hard Start · Global Voices
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their jobs, but rather to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been obtaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before codifying with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute the merit of tourism growth in place and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the steep and full of skid roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name at the entrance of a modern sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
He is a fantastic man of state and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen."
However, that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuses your administration of having a fat look.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that her husband murdered her.
"When I got home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross on which one single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old joke, a bully, a quejica.
What they want is for one simply to accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of the City of Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during their prison stay
The trial focuses on the Manning period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while in military detention.
During the interrogation conducted by the Prosecutor's Office in Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing conducted following the defence's request to dismiss the case as its imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already been sufficiently punished, came one day after Manning had testified that he had intended to commit suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers completed after visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When on Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the cellers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and had indicated to him that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'without incident' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he was receiving during the meeting in January 2011 with a board to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention at that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime under which he was present.
The military said that they had put him under that restrictive regime, which was below the level of suicide surveillance, to ensure their protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the state to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, blanket, knuckles, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even fall down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the janitors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment that Manning was receiving.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday declaration that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning account to stand naked in front of the janitors and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order he had given him that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that they had forced him to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his hems to self-injury but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their underwear, shawls and glasses from their cells.
Their lawyers are hoping that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he has experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted on the war council, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to have Manning find fault with minor crimes and defend other charges considered to be too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detained person in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had just gone down the road and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for Mexicans and one for Foreigners.
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, all my life I've been called Mexican.
This is ethnic taquigraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York qualify themselves as "Italian."
Later I decided to "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, the tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of strangers.
I thought at that time this week that Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries met, it included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as if he ventured to go to the United States.
It wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remembered that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at the time when a U.S. official says anything that leads to the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that which they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for those who do not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or some of the grandparents, who closed the door to opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty does.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category which is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this dew between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know with more solidity who they are and in seconds this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, guys.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented for how they treated their relatives a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first started, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything to their liking or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their fatal dead point situation could be derailed.
A war that neither loses nor wins
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks of both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and impoverished corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to stop Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The thrilling members of Hamas say that the half moon Islamist is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah militia dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot he ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may arise as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israel Iron Summit anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
Regarding diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the West Bank's corroboration barrier, the main part of a territory seeking to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that under international law they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why mime these Palestinian twists giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and hit them good if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, even though the Arab spring might alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire off is a good augur and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that calls for sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
Hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the people who are struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must start to halt the entry of arms into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to achieve a virtual status in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green black, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, comes into force and replaces logos and brand colors with an envelope of an olive green blackout, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes, which are mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of which are printed in a small type of source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
Trust studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco the counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited after the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for whistleblowers and silicone blankets to cover the unpleasant images of the crates had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a denial of the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has begun to take place online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from "footmen" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It may be asked whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what implies new regulations than on marketing.
Industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are affirming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to deliver a resolution in mid-2013.
Libersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering applying similar legislation on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher legislation is being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I simply don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Certainly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more complicated to put them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unseal a delivery; now I'm late four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it's the store," he says, as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane on which we flew suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about the duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and experts in child development praise the kindnesses of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Borrowing forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, it was supposed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("La boredom, a lively story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
Note that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boring may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while people who are bored may be related, they tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to have it.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which the participants heard a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened to a television program in the next room at any volume that had no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, we now know that to move or to make squirts, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as it makes that person more physically alert."
"Research shows that those children allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, generally, adolescents are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and his parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
She discovered that 32 percent of teenagers said she was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said she was bored when she was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest odds", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my first question: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, it will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer get bored, but he will not have learned to have fun on his own or dosage," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our objective should, rather, be to feel comfortable being separated from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a too distressing and disturbing desire to relate it to something worth it," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and then Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes that each carry a fine of US$ 100) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes due to drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes due to marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district prosecutors have pledged to move on with cases that are open for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the newly authorized marijuana stores from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses; all of this before the deadline comes, 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado is in front of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be addressed during that period, such as maintaining a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radius of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to bring court proceedings for minor marijuana offences to persons over the age of 21 and that the police would cease to file charges against these crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people are faced with charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring judicial action against those crimes that occurred at the time of their occurrence," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has even been complicated in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman for the National Law Reform Organization on marijuana.
"They have spent so much time bringing people to court that, in fact, they still cannot accept it to be legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national test cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will give up.
Despite the fact that there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed there to be marijuana sales for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not pull doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably show reluctance to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy overloader from Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the election, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted for in favour of what the state voted for."
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "They harassed me even from Oxford for being a Tory."
It doesn't attack college students by their views just now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I took my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history race, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college peers having sexual intercourse in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I was gone because they forced me to drink in empty cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They harassed me for a single reason, which in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right centre students is suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (collection of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as not grateful" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college in order to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student policy and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver jacket and a cane with silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish head" by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice-president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a student of history in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, states that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, aged 19 and elected president of the OUCA, states that the attitude of the JCR members towards the people who are of the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than the one.
I went to college in September 1986, she was an 18-year-old terribly shy girl.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an old student, an "honoris causa" title after the cuts in higher education funding.
The environment would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students met and met the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered that not only did the professors look at the ridicule of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the mining strike, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminary's wooden halls.
The first I attended was to translate into English the 18th century French texts and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one.
Pitt, a bald man with a face that looked like a dough of biscuit, knew well how to expel bad biles.
"Is thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other universities laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grumbled.
I went back to my room like a sorry soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight slap in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labourers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after nightfall?
Should I become a labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people writing his speeches to him.
I was just out there.
He hated the place he considered provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997, he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my most open family and friends of metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Take another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his belief.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a little while.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns weekly in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was surrounded by fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they packed their bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers, but is currently hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Costura" exhibition, which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apotheosic that gathers over 130 high seaswear dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the farthest and backward world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, they abound in private letters and photos with the signature of the largest grenade in the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble fadist of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off their nipples on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on his floor.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Coustura Week in 1995.
"It never passes by fashion because its designs are works of art," he ends.
Amornity parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-relevant love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "a hearing" that lights up Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the garment that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fairy.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they're "donors" on his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescribing Patricia della Giompaola d'Arenbergtampoco may forget the first time she saw a Valentino.
When he was a teenager and lived in Italy, he dreamed of getting the age and opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, "corsage" flagged and escort word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashionist calls his seamstresses) to develop that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four- and a half-foot tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high seas of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Over the years with the "know-being" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates both honours and any of his clients' spouses.
"He has always drawn attention to his refinement, his calmness, his purple and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by drawing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies by getting in touch with the air.
After removing large sulphur rocks, which in total come in spite of about 70 kilos, they carry them into two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through steep stone trails.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the extensive carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb by step from tortoise, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps not to slip and fall through the cliff.
They know that any transplant could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was exposed years ago for the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, steps are opened between tourists who photograph them as circus monkeys and, tiresomely carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating since 1960 the volcano and never better said to its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerillas, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As normal is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," Anto explains, who usually performs three daily ports.
It takes three hours each and ends soft, but allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Though it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what would gain in the field.
"The mining newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) ", the carrier, who previously worked as a harvester on the touristic island of Bali, clarifies.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the slum was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, then down to the crater immersing himself with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and to both weight.
In fact, it does not even come part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of charge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for animals and not for people," said Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18-10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and picks the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which have been distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By rocking the basket on its back, Unainik can only load 50 kilos at his 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamasari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a path of goats between the marshes.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder, 30 years old, also works by charging sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one who makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looks for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem overwhelming that these verses are part of an announcement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap using local references such as "Let's put a bao (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, welcomes the hope that with the ad they manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to "his national duty."
This is pure internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So let's think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriage and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness and delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia is so widespread that it is hardly disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage the developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the largest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out of days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre would seem to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is about the quality of private life or "the field of private life that is entitled to protect against any interference".
What is private for a under 16 year old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to ventilating situations on the Internet that you would certainly not share offline?
the Periodic interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not add them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been counting for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that obscene photographs, naked people, crimes, or writing humiliating or violent comments are wrong.
Jorge ensures that he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just picking them up," he says.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to reply that you would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demand it just by the bags of my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was extorting him into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I never knew who I was," she says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"Just gave her privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I fell ill, or I'd like it.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we're still learning," he says.
He comments that the theme is complex, "because we are asking you to have a definite criterion on what it is appropriate to spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give you that."
"They are also selective when they care most about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission from other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be in social networks," he says.
Surveillance
Stuart Guardia, a university professor, a primary professor and an educational consultant, notes that it is essential for parents to read the policies of social networks to their conscience.
By understanding each of the indents they have solid grounds for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Completes the Unasur Summit without publicizing the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
EE tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Affairs and Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian Government.
Upon being consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information at the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronunciation, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of the Arab South American Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being persistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration which they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the ASPA official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that there were secured transmission systems for all journalists but restricted information to the fullest extent.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court that settled a border dispute between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will take and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, together with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added Piñera, and greeted Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the inconsistency of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after the afternoon of Lima.
The representative read the outcome document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will give "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-price internet access across all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triumphant matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional appointment he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"On the morning (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope with President Ortega I can tell you that we handle this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the take-over of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
He defended, in that regard, the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers from any South American country, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," Ecuador stated in alluding to the political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said that she is not sorry for that decision because she has not betrayed her principles, but has respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected."
Moreover, he criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Sweden's own legislation allows him to do so through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian representative.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being confined in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a conduit allowing him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been discussions with London in search of a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there has been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures at different European levels," he said.
And he thought that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa used to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what she does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and evil politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists were no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominated Ecuador," and said that if they were re-elected, it would "deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and couppism clothed with legality" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the judgement of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that error is not taken into account.
It's a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to process them in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime limits in the same court as Peru and Chile, and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to accept judgment as hard as it may be".
Referring to the eventuality that is presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa assured that if it loses the elections in February 2013 it will withdraw from public life.
In the staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, for we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and then we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's vice president Nicolás Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths per AIDS today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," referring to remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more smooth," without obvious success.
The boy hid his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates timely treatment and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent to which patients are affected by the immune system when starting the diagnosis, with better expectations for non-drug users: up to 30 years of age with a CD4 count and 50 years of age, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who are diagnosed with positive HIV at the age of 25, under these terms "while being in control can live without problems up to 75 years," said the interviewee.
To shape this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I see it, so it's happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their status of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said a strong data: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make early diagnoses and, therefore, they must offer evidence of detection in a massive way, to all people who require it."
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to test a particular laboratory, only motivated by the fact that a friend had done it and, despite his short age, he was already in stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die now, I'd better come back three times a week," they say no to me.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medication.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponding, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Millenio JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
May the test be done, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatío journalist who has taken the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out there are those who still have no access to a condom today," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments of social workers, school guidance, pharmacies employees and health personnel, to whom adolescents are not exposed, said the communiqué.
I proposed reorientating this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the display boxes and those hundred are located in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites where young people attend.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have distributed condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already have sex," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because for a recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by an appeal court in the United States a judgment which does not know the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the downstream procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the back to the sentence issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankerrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless to Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in the arms of Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case states that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Appeals Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial tender in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational corporations.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created to that end, setting the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-companies vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts owed by Vitro’s subsidiaries with their parentage, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies debt endorsed the Federal Institute of Trade Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Appeals Tribunal.
From another point of view, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis he faced in the United States, hitting the country's collections.
Soon, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals for the vote to reach its plenary session, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare's appeal will be sought by a higher court to review the proceedings, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The gravity of the case is that the court terminated a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Trade Competitions Act, noting that it was released with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Banking Law.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
For several months the complaints put on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the exduan of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Aeroplane Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to give reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from Bank IXE trust F/589, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mars.
Meeting on the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society generally approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the products of the country of the wall, with a grasshopper housing area for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that swept away with some of the protected areas and raised the mother of all the hidden against the industry.
ACTA Died
Soslayed by the government a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known by its acronyms in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering the attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting the short ones, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, player of the National Superior Basketball, mastered and leader in the BSN with the Bahamon Cows or president of the basketball Federation.
"I put a lot of hats on the basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his broad trajectory, so they testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who cherish with greater emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he served 15 years as co-powered or controlled franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cows' Championships since 1967, whether as a possessor, co-powered or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I got fired with one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy at the BSN.
Henceforth he took charge of "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong 6"7" player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativeized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cows' Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already a federal order.
By that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and Mincy's on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the 1989 pre-eminent in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth and it must have been bronze not to be by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group of the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a pellet to the United States team, which was quite similar to what the bronze won us in the world.
That team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre- Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the Pan-American Silver Sea game, we win gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count his career in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best bourician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island at national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
I'm pleased with that.
What are you doing now?
What I do most is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer home of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved Dallas hometown, representing again the iconic paper she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
I brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and he lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 she was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in her liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the string NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well-received papers from "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his starry peak.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was airborne from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
It also helped give the series a record of hearings at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned "Dallas" into the second most visible entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with being a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried that his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tomb," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation you lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to meet and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Five of the chapters had already been recorded for the second season, and one sixth was in the process, reported the chain.
Immediately there was no pronouncement by Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Oriondo de Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stellarized classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to Ben Hagman’s lawyer.
He made good luck in the theaters of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought I'd hurt someone or somehow affect them," she told Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a organ donation promoter and volunteered to attend a hospital to attend the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they come to their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like, "no friend, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They begin a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Stuart Charmé's religion teacher decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long regression account" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what he expected in the next couple of months: the hurricane cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedarmagedon" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the History Professor of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to conduct a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "near ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It got tired in two hours," Restall said about his high-average course for students, who filled up with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still any place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of 21 December.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he agreed that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days of the final trial have been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're planning to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe call some friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old Samira Ford, a communications student.
