Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sporter Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it moved to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3,000 metres high, where many badads had gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners have a hard time finding the money they need to repair the motorway infrastructure in decrepitude, many of them are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record all thousands of cars and transmit information to public servants, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to reform the obsolete funding system of major U.S. roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a strong debate and the enlivened alliances.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the thousands you're traveling, and possibly the road on which you're going, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is down.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of the Congress did not agree to continue, several States did not wait.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they can move on to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles covered.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental shift.
This is truly essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to begin recording the thousands of Californian motorists by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they did before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently had tracers installed on 500 cars to test a thousand-dollar payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this cost of use at the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the city's liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce gas spills and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious laws on climate warming.
But Mr. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
The supporters of the Free Market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay for the mile.
"It's not just a tax that gets stuck in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the path of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many thousands every day to go to work or to the city.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the State a kilometre of costs instead of taxes on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) explores how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists have recently equipped their car with an aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government can follow their every step of the way.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Department of Transport.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into fully localized devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and overwhelming technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep recordings of people's daily goings and comings.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now emerging to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many thousands drive a car, but not knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do this, added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She sought to break into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have been used to planners of the major axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive ways and less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide "pass payment" insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Cars would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on payment to the mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, officials say that Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that each one pays its fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when there is simply a need for aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs to the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listeners Â· Global Voices
The English musician did not finish this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury edition scheduled for November 4, with several novels.
Four have already emerged on the toilet.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in their pants.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be trusted to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not by surprise, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will present itself in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will total 10 additional tracks compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially released for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And above all, it gives a foretaste of its new Atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very advanced guitars and a smartly controlled rock electricity.
New Releases Already Listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is a double-faced: a disturbing intro before a luminous ride that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, charmers, give you the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: turn informer, man on board a rocket, potential March...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising therefore that he has a mask by hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10th.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them are released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not meet the army's "university of service" rule demanding that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They mentioned two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, had post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to remain for a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from the start, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are unable to fight.
Under the current rules, severely wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, requested the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while New Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to focus the tablets on its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney Group's channels is planned only in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells about the adventures of Catte Callie, sheriff of a city in western America where she makes the order reign with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President in charge of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its public through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published in the early weeks by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of the under 8 years, respectively, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence service whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide any answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian StrÃ¶bele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoyed the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations that it is impossible to defend itself against."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany were severely challenged following complaints that the NSA had been listening to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group who oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," he needed to take advantage of it.
Mr StrÃ¶bele, Member of Parliament Green German, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr StrÃ¶bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials â including the United States â felt that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video service on request Netflix via their television in the future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary reported Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step to its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date with regard to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our clients are currently not accessing.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable operators to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay on-line services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would result in interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said Cogeco's p.-d.g..
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82Â¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 Â¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable company, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they experienced a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 Â¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93Â¢ per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, Cogeco Cable's number of clients is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry about seeing the number of customers fluctuating like that.
For me, it is not an indication of a change of trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been picked in beef cans sold by two small British low-priced brands, the food hygiene agency has announced today.
routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal about the presence of horsemeat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four early Friday on Highway 131 in LanaudiÃ¨re.
Just before 4h, a car driver who was driving north, in Saint-FÃ©lix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic returned to normal around 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Border Airlines plans to make baggage pay by hand
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Border Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in her announcement Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the cane unopened with them at the plane's descent.
The new baggage charges relate to the bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Border stated that it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
Border Spokesman Kate O'Malley indicated that $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to get this price paid," she explained.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the handbags arranged in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in those compartments.
These costs are a way of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really serve to collect money.
It is a matter of conveying to Border clients that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a Border boarding gate could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Border site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Border hand baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no dates have been set.
Passengers often rumble about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people at Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that proves that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of the air trip after years of loss.
Yet many of them did not touch the baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegient company followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the unusual baggage charges imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see toothbrushes and a fight popping at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are on board at lightning speed".
Border also does as Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the cane unopened with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to have baggage charges paid by hand when passengers don't buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than to go to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced premiums by 25 per cent on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would allow you to earn 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Border site.
Border has a loyal clientele in its home city, Denver, but its activity retreats and it loses money.
Revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to restore Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question an "internal error" rather than computer hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday it was a bug that had caused the loss of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that took place during a planned update," said the espionage agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesman.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system concerned.
The NSA was once ultra-secret, a time known as the "No Such Agency", was under the spotlight of the projectors and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs â which are part of NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former NSA counsellor Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has prompted many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors in Montreal Thursday, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees drop.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," said Regional Director of Working Relations at the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
Delta's closure is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee"
After having thrown the sponge with weakness in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the U.S. tireman Titan, declares today ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you are back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fire" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best-paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours are disabled in France.
In India, China and other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and competent workers, it is worth the effort.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the factory closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep Amiens' factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on departure benefits for all employees.
Hence, there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr Montebourg said that you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on start-up allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide guarantees of employment time when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that the CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord over four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while aircraft deliveries and orders are down.
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aeronautical and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his entire new CSeries aircraft nor information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial deployment schedule by September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the aircraft stole only three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecast and the share rate declined by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered its rating Thursday, from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock exchange increase in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a customer rating.
We think Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm controls for CSeries aircraft is so far modest to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new line.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders prior to the first aircraft's commercial operation.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was progressing in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than planned," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to take a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will soon follow, indicated the company.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight test â although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule â reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result per action adjusted remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 planes, compared to 83 earlier.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division was $32.9 Md as at September 30, which was unchanged compared to December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division's order book totaled $32.6 Md as of September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have been affected by some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share rate, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the Board of Directors, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest airline manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists were reported missing in a gouffre under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, we learned Friday at the Speleo emergency in IsÃ¨re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one war in practice and the other not, had left under the ground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, specified the same source.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Speleo relief in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on the ground
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians from the French Speleo rescue, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firemen were on site.
By the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speculologists were located.
"It's another group of epileologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, sent the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," Le DauphinÃ© explains.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the ChambÃ©ry Mountain Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost in the network, returned to their steps waiting for relief, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalist's union invited its members Thursday to cease using Google and Yahoo's online services following further revelations on the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid even new orders to use Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging," she said in a press release.
It considers the information in the Washington Post to be " scandalous" that the American National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Repeated acts: a Member of Parliament is applying for the resignation of Brigitte Gruwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Gruwels to "relift" theposts of the signalling lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday, which included 16 flagposts from the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to recap all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of approximately EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resign" of Brigitte Gruouels.
"Not happy to spend the money of Brussels in the re-lifting operations of the flagposts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Gruouels continues his Flemish operations of the Capital", emerges Mr. De Bock in a communiquÃ©.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally recaptured herself in dark-blue-black yellow the Brussels poles.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA program itself.
It's high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Grubels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of Brussels!" concludes De Bock.
the portal of Pont-de-Buis dismounted
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and the traffic on the national was diverted into the slump.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefectures of FinistÃ¨re Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomov, portico manager.
These are the last of the three eco-tax ports operating in the FinistÃ¨re department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire an listener, a charger or even a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibre or an intra-atrial listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "steal."
There is no recipe, no method of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakens in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle against cancer.
At least that's what I thought on the day I found her body empty, squealed on this hospital bed with cold sheets.
Likewise, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin light of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small daytime or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in mourning.
And then, it revealed itself to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I was finding her, full and complete.
This distance from the way of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" it seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, lending him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time, then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I still mean: what would they have said, what would they have thought, what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always something that prevents me from fulfilling that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams lead to me on the contrary and enter into my history and, indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor, and he smiled at me, and he was happy that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am delighted to share this common memory experienced after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor's home that I was at the time.
I've still realized my mourning pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and I am interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, were not, with the decline, anodine choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she has instilled me are always present, so I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and rightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a kind soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes laying on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have been through all phases: the misunderstanding, the anger, the pain, the cries that start alone, whenever, in unusual places, times in which there are incongruous.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only the lack, this void without response, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me at the hollow of her gentleness.
Yet, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes laying on me, I see the circles that raise his eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my three children died from 43 years of cancer.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hole of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the moral is a little affected.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was the conductor and we are trying to stay in the path that she had tracked us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence cannot take it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, a follow-up to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I wasn't able to attend her inhumation and three weeks after her death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
My husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our six-year-old son.
The immense pain that invaded me at that time has, of course, been lessened, but he is always close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I said no, he answered me "I came down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in a blizzard, worried and turned on the hair lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since I left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible trade, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most murderous month since April 2008.
Baghdad published this Friday of the official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister was received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wishes to help the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be with us and to support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq is not settled, it's going to expand, and what's going on in Syria is going to expand too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by the Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded billboards to accuse him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide help.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed in the great day.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assizes
A senior defence attorney, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Dita, 42, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he had compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was referred to as "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "primary case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32 years old, filing three sacks of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Dita was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire County, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine amounting to Â£1.5 million, as well as over Â£200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Dictta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would not be revealed in the day.
Today, at Liverpool's seat court, Dita, who works in the Forbes Solicitors lawyer's firm located in Blackburn, has fallen in disgrace after being convicted of two counts of imprisoning justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted cocaine possession during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him coming to Dita's home and placing drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Dita who was at a dinner at the foot of Ewood Park, pregnant with Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Dita was arrested later but refused to use cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Dita collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that clients would call him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could in order to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He has been too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed him to compromise his independence.
Dita denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr.Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal lawyer himself when he began to obtain drugs from criminal organizations."
Her addiction to cocaine has forever compromised her and made her vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have commissioned her to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation into Mr. Dita, who was found guilty of the three counts of cocaine possession and now an impediment to justice, bearing in mind his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years of imprisonment for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself in which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21st at the Sound Board Room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin made a recording of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Not to mention the disease she was suffering from, the famous performer of Respect told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seashore covered with a light coat: the heat blow to Menton could be fluttered with the billing of the lights.
An invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, not by traders' associations.
To ease its costs, the city uses help.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynettes imagined and interpreted by local artists, cartoons with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to learn the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Kingdom lyrical Art Society will come back with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now serves as a room for the Chicoutimi Pulp.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical AppÃ©ro, the concert-benefit held last August, with the contribution of the soprano colorature Marie-Ãve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft in the ears as an air of La bauve-mouris.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"Financials are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will go through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond," added Director General HÃ©lÃ¨ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostages, kidnapping, making threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to dismantle the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet through a communiquÃ©.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New Request for Collective Appeal against the Brothers Sainte-Croix
A new application for collective remedy was filed against the Brothers of Saint Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time in St Joseph's oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", which was reportedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at St. Joseph's oratory, where he was serving as Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us, "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both remedies.
The collective remedy that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of St. Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers Sainte-Croix.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory of St. Joseph, a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of and have suffocated sexual abuse", and that they have "satisfiedly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Ms. Ãmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second stage is the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire was seriously damaged by a roundabout trade in LaSalle, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescues were called about 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself at the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with RÃ©jane Street.
The thirty firemen who were sent to the scene took about an hour to master the brasier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief of the Montreal Fire Safety Service operations, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical aid to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, held this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical help to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical help to die.
If adopted, Alberte DÃ©ry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she complains.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie's house in Gatineau, felt that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Association of Palliative Care, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill disorientes the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will go the wrong way.
For her part, Gatineau's Liberal Member, StÃ©phanie VallÃ©e, said that the notion of an end-of-life should be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask ourselves the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the paper challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group â owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is a government extension" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to "hand over the media."The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had been hit hard" and castted the bill as a "draconist."
The adoption of the bill is at the same time a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack robbed so-called the luxury shopping centre.
The police chief, David Kimaiyo, reacted by summoning two journalists and one media officer to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a survey of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "retired" or not being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "enlived blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and harvesting."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the population's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their mirobolizing wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt â which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused a complete emo at the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the Pharmacy Department has found itself highly staff-deficit.
There was almost 30% of the staff required, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire self-employed workers, which may cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of troubleshooting, explained Mrs. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced to a level, the time that things are changing.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmaceutical residents] in order for them to come and stay here.
There's a circumstance contest that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is announced significantly easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always ride three maternity leaves when it's okay, she added.
Last year, there was a lot more and there were no pharmacists who were available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top model of 22 years does not begin his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This egrene pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will emerge in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrant growing to sex since adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to his elder is striking: a toast silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not to mention a taste of the risk: the one who did not hesitate to lay naked on ice paper will show up in much more sulfurous situations on the large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the toilet: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their stink in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From BjÃ¶rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last retaliation, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at Narbonne's Mega CGR, as a precautionary measure, following the tinglings felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
People were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad jesting on the bottom of tear jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Is it always that the direction of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients in depth?
The room was aired and everything went into order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruit
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in the country in citrusries on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of passenger baggage that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three pre-frozen tanks.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCG) office which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, the CBSA's spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of drugs.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short-range SA-8 air-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new flight raid of Tsahal in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances that were almost the same as the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an American anonymous leader who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont's underground missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
The Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's credit rating Friday, challenging the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The note on the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", which is based on the category of speculative investment.
It has a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one out of three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign currencies to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of foreign credits.
These reservations, to which the authorities have resorted massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is finding it more and more likely to devaluation, which would increase its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
His debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has now released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while being "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "it cannot be expected a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with the presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert, interviewed by the PSA.
Only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Ioulia Timoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who fears Moscow's "commercial restrictions".
Russia, the fourth of Ukraine's exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
United States green light at the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the deadline for review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, scheduled by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", announce the two groups in a communiquÃ©.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
The Congolese army is hunting for the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the M23 rebels up to their bases in the forests and mountains of the neighbouring North Kivu of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being expelled from the communities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which he had controlled since the beginning of 20 months ago from the insurrection.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and take it wherever it hides because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way alter his claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Crowds are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last village in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of North Kivu Province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Blue Helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission to the DRC, the world's largest workforce, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC Staff was remodeled and the army moved on to the M23 offensive, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch at its end," predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government succeeded in striking a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accuse Rwanda, which denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, consisting of former Congolese mutiny soldiers.
British diplomat William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint and announced a foreign office spokesperson.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived one year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be one day liberated by the army," testified a resident of this neighbouring town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (of the M23), we were traumatized," said this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of having reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining withdrawn from the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters were, on average, on a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while gains from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a net downturn on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School Transport: the complaint deemed admissible
From the beginning of the school year, the School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (SCRS) requires a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students with two residences, a service that the organization provides when it is in a position to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the commission and I was interested," says LefÃ¨vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional period to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to get together and find solutions," says LefÃ¨vre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-God emergencies
Faced with the cracks carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several trade unions, including CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, on 10 July, decided to "schedule the schedule for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date for the closure of emergencies that will not be possible on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of taking care of emergencies in Paris early in the winter" was also aimed at not disturbing the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, closure should still be effective by that date.
Although, at PAHP, the term "transformation" or "continuity change" is preferred.
With effect from November 4, the firefighters who made about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the Hotel-Dieu emergencies will all have received orders to take thirty serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-God, emergency specialists will leave place Monday to five general medical inmates.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says LoÃ¯c Capron, president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the PAH, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no longer patients brought by the firemen, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new HÃ´tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he tempers, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also says.
But it is up to the SRA to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things are taking place gradually," said Nicolas PÃ©ju, spokesperson for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or he was lied to," deplores urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
Leaving his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the campaign against the reorganisation project, he defines himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They're emptying and choking emergencies that have been renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're regularly fattened.
There are, for example, nine hours of waiting for the LariboisiÃ¨re emergencies.
At the SRA, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
The "new hospital model" that has been launched since October 7 is being defended at both the SRA and the PAH, which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of an "absorbing stay".
"Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnoses," asks Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the Minister does not take a measure by Monday, we will change the armpit, he warns Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the CGT Health.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Paris UMP advisor and elected from the 4th arrondissement, it clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would make her disagreement clear, notes Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic monitoring of World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, this officer did not specify whether such monitoring had been in place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the hearings of the ONU headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the âsustainable development goalsâ to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, prior to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "surpass national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, in the process of toiling them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment society.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there were reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangings since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million of investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale do Brasil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo have rejected each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamo bastion on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza declared to the AFP on Wednesday, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost person" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza â who should retire at the end of his second term next year â wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led to disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the catches took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People believe that the country's future is the government and the president, and that it is the country's responsibility to find solutions to problems," he explained.
Omar Sultanane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brutal force does not weigh against subtle Russian," while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too outrageous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for a "carefully selective selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "fully detect", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The familiar basis of what we show and what we don't say.
A Hamas armed branch fighter was killed this evening and another injured by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they fired an Israeli armoured shell fire.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time an American government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it does not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he participated in since Washington on Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and information collection through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since taken many attacks, thanks to interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived".
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one would feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies from the United States and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was unaware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have been seized of these communications before providing it to the NSA.
This would be about "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not aim at Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread Friday in Asia.
Indonesia convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also generated China's air.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master's talent, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiquÃ©.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco, has released the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the attacker 32 years old.
The communiquÃ© simply indicates that it is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the wound.
However, he suffered inflammation of the left knee at his return of selection, in the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at Paris City Hall, must attend and will then explain at a press conference his proposals on funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a relative's obsesses, it's the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "element of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still bad in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," said Marie-FrÃ©dÃ©rique BacquÃ©, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la morte.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to approvise it.
Learning the cremation is for FranÃ§ois Michaud-NÃ©rard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French want one, for their relatives, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of those who chose a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For over ten years, they have tried to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the remission of ashes," says Michaud-NÃ©rard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, carry out the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of those who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is relayed, to the attention of those who could not make the journey.
The crematorium has allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation for rats turns to polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the emergency situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to house the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, estimates JoÃ«l Canapa, the director of the Office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratisation company performs two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to abandon, and the rats do not spray in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our home," says the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the envelope and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends in decline of 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony fell from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preys on the flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firemen were sent to 9 HÃ©bert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-storey house spread over four floors behind the Court of the Seminary of Quebec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firemen arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took some strength to attack the building, because it is buildings glued here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of lecturer at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the poster heads have emerged in Carolines, and have been very successful, until they become too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the comedy world.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival have been through non-traditional circuits, for example showing on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lassif on the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is even more famous for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young single-voiced actors (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up actor, but he became a film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, he sometimes went down a alley between two buildings and said, Well, if I lost all my money, maybe I'd come live here.
The price of oil keeps falling and approaching $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing industry in electricity is growing.
The price of the US reference crude for delivery in December fell from $14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Merchantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for October.
The high supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent brute, a reference for the international brute already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 per barrel on Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Question of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored to Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a Trial Judge this week.
This judgement means that a law passed in July in that State and which largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice GIV will have to have a "privilege of admission" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, under his or her hospital-care status, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
ICG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court of first instance considered on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions concerning the admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governor's position, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a strong return, alongside audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, which is 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the pox AndrÃ© Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why such disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first premium.
As with each year, the first hearing shows are a wide choice of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
On Twitter, we want shows, emotions, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their account there.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make fun of it.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution as a result of the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be disparaging of the case because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which he responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons who were dismissed after police control.
The city's appeal is expected to be heard after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD's control and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after the police force has been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that it reformed the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Renters have to go and vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the housing price that goes to the City tax.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase our rents to help pay the new taxes.
As we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they were going to attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 fireworks, 4-5 million land in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef chef of the ElysÃ©e
Entered the 500 m2 of Elysean cuisine as committed after working in embassies, the cook weighed all levels until he became head nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to FranÃ§ois Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of greats of this world in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years of age.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 at the FertÃ©-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was a cook herself in a castle of Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" ironized Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for which he has served, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in ElysÃ©e's kitchens!
It does not displease Heads of State who displayed a relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all greedy", gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a bit more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the plates were empty!
As for FranÃ§ois Hollande, who restored cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at ElysÃ©e: "between 200 and 250 people must be served in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the ElysÃ©e cuisine, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."FranÃ§ois Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side came out," he said.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in ElysÃ©e for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec Friday at noon.
The four-bedroom building, located on 15 HÃ©bert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire department.
The fire went forward, but stood on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, stated that the rapid response of the firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in a close-up manner.
The burning house was housed four houses, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage has been completely limited, even if water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the saptors have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: Exit of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images from his next film whose role-title, that of an ambitious New Yorker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will disqualify you in his role as a deranged trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island stockbroker, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then mounted a herring that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chained to parties, women, drugs.
Declination and excesses in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio pair seems to have recovered the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long mounting.
Looks like the movie lasts at 2:45.
In the hall on 25 December, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race in a fair manner.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to attempt to confirm a cane pipe on a connection involving the then-in-exercise Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared before Old Bailey's court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special adviser."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and "plant permanently in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr.Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He claims otherwise, but we say, "Of course we do."
Rumors about a link involving Clarke were first taken over by the NotW editor's office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that he had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on its phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information on her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have overseen the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a vocal message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as other important men, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself was attending the co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks have not conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having made phone hacks.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the heart of violence
The President of the United States was due to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most murderous month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence is becoming increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated Government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence causes fear of a new embrace while neighboring Syria is in danger of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains that he has been politically marginalized and that he is the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (the Sunni extremists), also involved in the Syrian civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the U.S. interviews of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the President of the United States, elected on the promise to put an end to military engagement in that country, had prepared an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of the Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nuri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The head of the Chinese Homeland Security accused a group of Uighur separatists of Xinjiang Friday of being behind the trapping car attack that killed five on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, darkened on the crowd that was on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau for Internal Security Affairs, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there through independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group that stood behind was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, with his words echoed by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was from Ouighore and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained fuel-filled receptacles and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The East Turkestan Islamic movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive records such as contraception, divorce and couples of same-sex individuals.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent to each bishop's national conference in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Fif
The irreducibles of the M23, or a few hundred combatants, were cut off about 2000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the northern Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said AFP, a Jumba resident, telephoned about 12:30 a.m., and according to which a girl was wounded by bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has diminished a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have somewhat pushed the rebels."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had spent the night in Jomba before going up to the front for a "cratish operation".
There was a clear understanding behind him of cracking with light weapons.
De Bunagana, political fief and last strong place of the rebellion on Wednesday, a PSA journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "encircled the residual M23 positions to delocate them".
Since the return on Friday, clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with decisive support for intelligence, observation and planning.
By the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well-stocked in ammunition, were riding in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border crossing with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC-flambing truck, which was to take over another gear driving M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called again on Wednesday evening the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" under the penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing without results since December for now.
On the spot, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, but we only have the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 Delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which rebutted Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC that had begun in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went through to go into our fields, but the military told us to go back," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on the back.
It seems that firefights are approaching populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sang and danced take flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It's a revolution: French music affirms itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts engaged in ridicule.
And the successes like Cabaret or The Miserables wore the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at the Chatelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "Un AmÃ©ricain Ã  Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Music Comedies" and lecturer at the Theatre du ChÃ¢telet, analyzes the reasons for the so hard-won success.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the pleasure of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year back bond on the pretext that we can use almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in front of the poster.
Afterwards, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the ChÃ¢teaut that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes anglo-Saxon musical comedy of variety by adapting it in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Spider Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like on Broadway as a singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent nursery is as significant as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays start on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of an enchantment of these girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a ZÃ©nith province.
The mayonnaise is climbed to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30 am, on the inner ring of Brussels up to Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m. at the place of the accident, the time the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not lead to bottlenecks because the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this outlet/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured following an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Caribbean Pirates".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Attack Â· Global Voices
Children play on a carbonized armour that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, October 31, 2013, in the East DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The aim is to relocate the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took up the hill of Bugina, which surpasses that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
" Chanzu's is not very strategic," said AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been cut to about 2,000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jumba
In Jomba, an inhabitant who reported fighting very near Thursday all day indicated that the situation has been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fights of the day before and were buried.
One girl was injured by bullets, and three other people were injured, one of which was seriously injured by the FARDCs, adding that witness quoted by the PSA.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no account of the loss in human lives.
NSA's revelations increase the paranoia of companies with respect to state surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American avant-post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of American Intelligence Services, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "stolen the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director by word.
Reports show that the US National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by US storage service providers in the cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised company paranoia with respect to state surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver GrÃ¼n, president of BITMi, representing the German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published by the EY Council Office in July.
However, in all of Mr. Snowden's documents, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
The politicians expressed concern at the EU's lack of sufficient IT and Internet capacity and believed that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"It's not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German corporate software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, by farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of U.S. spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that until then thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is happening in cloud computing as European leaders have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-American members gave up their projects to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, said: "Our customers are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee that they will be physically left in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It's been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF's chemical producer society.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least unwise to retrieve a free USB key at a professional show or leave a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the automobile manufacturer Audi, said that the collection of mobile phones before the board's meetings, so that they could not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad due to the risk of damage to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then dropped.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warned in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The United States of America's National Estimated Intelligence (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree perpetrators of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
One member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died under unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in his high school gymnasium, think that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a supporting carpet standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff of Lowndes County found that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family challenged these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics as well as the common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a signboard and they were returned to a coffin bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore declared on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson died from "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates any evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The sheriff's office representative from Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said that they hoped that video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in every 20 children in the United States are currently suffering from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching body and staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine â the EpiPen auto-injector being the most commonly used â to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
States' legislative assemblies have recently updated regulations to enable schools to have epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something stings on my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tinglings on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, goes public in calling on the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on his board of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When FranÃ§ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues worldwide, we consider that, in the eyes of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no case to be indignant about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we avoid American collaboration?
The development of technology tools for interception by the United States, but also by France, for the past decade, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, among other things, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to develop interception tools, that the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of violations of freedoms.
What are the real risks of the United States ? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to report them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit in their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are demanding, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and thus to the possession of the NSA.
Last element: The vast movement of revelations by media around the world, which helps to initiate a debate on intelligence surveillance practices up to now almost non-existent, could move legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female gender of the new births will no longer be attributed to them, rigidly, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report their children's sex, allowing them to register "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions on a sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, contusioned and swept away.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children born each year is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term that designates persons with chromosomes or atypical gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering an act of surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sex identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without an operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery around gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as being different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and clearly defined as being either one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters, (such as muscle mass, pylosity, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young non-conformity boys now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her trial on appeal that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F â X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this landly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "because the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overturned."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about ten years ago, the medical community viewed the genre as a slate, which can be wiped out and re-designed on.
But now, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may deceive themselves, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He used the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals â the way parents raise a child â interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as John/John, his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a broken circumcision of having him castrated entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he remarried a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth â and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breast removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "calls for labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "indetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is experiencing a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law "will hold parents and children responsible".
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its Androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and interned in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
"The law leaves parents a certain latitude so they don't have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time before registering "male" or "female".
So everything is fine â you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a relative.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable â and it's something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will continue until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the approach of the Senate vote to disqualify Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left-hand center leader said he had "closed the intention" to continue ruling with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its dismissal.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's orders that he already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting exchange.
Firefighters called at the scene claimed to have responded to a call referring to "multiple wounded".
"Order forces are on site," the airport says on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said the AFP a spokesperson for the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch, and a second was transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. local (12h30 in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza-scess
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, was learned from sources of health services.
One source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered Biden dropping for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in Mark Halperin's 2012 campaign book and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and reported on Thursday evening that the President's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's ban on Obama's re-election while his hopes were fading.
According to Times Jonathan Martin's political correspondent, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior campaign officials and the White House, the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the Vice President with the former Secretary of State Clinton.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within Chicago's campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's close advisers â including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former advisors at White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe â knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley took the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?".
While Daley called the "certified" examination, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would benefit from the election.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of any change.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President "had known" of any change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not fully answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's ban on the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the jelly-based world.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it licks, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something amazing but we're only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 Â£."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice gets brighter.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the lightness of jellyfish is worth four times the price of gold.
So every ball costs me about Â£ 140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual fragrances of ice, such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It's intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jelly synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a session of tai chi
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and carried out the famous tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician breaking the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before she died to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pinging.
Over the past two years, I haven't distributed a single candy, and I certainly won't do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the Galician sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans â 158 million of them in fact â will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises are expected to represent $1.2 million of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sex objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of Daft Punk's space will be included in our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will spend $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't gland.
The Americans are spending $1.9 million on candy this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million pounds of Hershey bars, susceptes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to shine yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of recipes, according to America Haunts, and that includes these great pictures of you pissing about what your friends are putting on Facebook and you can't take away and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment about the " pretty head" style.
Finally, let's talk about citrus fruit.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and carving a lantern-shaped pumpkin, it's like decorating a Christmas tree â it's something we've been doing since we were very small.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrole trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these potions and did not have to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal default structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (â¬45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to expand its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of questionable assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it in the next three years.
RIB also stated that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional suspicious debts of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RIB also stated that this internal restructuring would free from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RIBs.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for the clientele and the United Kingdom," said new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point bracket seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, general manager of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the United Kingdom and international, and prepare for the rigors and realities of the raid rally.
We have had a lot of fun developing the vehicle of the Defender Challenge â the championship will really be exciting.â
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firemen were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career
Firefighters come down in memory along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable cliff threshold.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on the road on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career after an accident without gravity.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp vision who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a career corner, pinned 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton's firehouse ran into the scene and descended in reminder to save Ruby by using an animal cider to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn't move during the rescue â she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: " Ruby was very lucky to get rid of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified watching the rescue."
I didn't first think she was up there.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were good.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move."
Firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a choreist on Jagger's song "Old Habitats Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he dredged me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed first in the charts this week.
Beijing Challenges a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security agency boss to a Hong Kong television channel, according to an online video Thursday night on an internet site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a special organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominant region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gasoline drums against the entrance of the prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declared itself fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a line of bearded sons along the Hadrian wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has indicated the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the major titles (and that was to be expected).
Neither did anyone say that EU Member States devote much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for all that it wants to obtain from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the post-war grand plan for unifying Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project has officially died.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits â it was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has placed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters â what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem vis-Ã -vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending â encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper problem of productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels â which is a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer's expense â the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-responsive drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All global wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is spreading, particularly in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to go wrong.
As a result, the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes â a timely warning for the British Labour Party which reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-money bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, which is quite possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the single anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something more similar to the "Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" which the General of Gaulle gives free preference to.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will make the United States easy.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Great Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be an area of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending us to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is â and it is worth noting â the anti-austerity political movement that has made the best success in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Squiquiquier, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Older
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if the pubic breasts and hair of her daughter start growing at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents â in general, it doesn't indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, under-arm hair and in the pubic area and body smells, appear earlier among girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops â this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify endocrinologist tests to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size to adulthood.
Recommendations for medical and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others".
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10 years of age.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened and upset school to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories available to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sex messages are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz asserts that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6-9 who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms appear to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate conditions, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the PAA conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and young children.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose early puberty must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
Inside Llewyn Davis of the Coen Brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just started to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French CinÃ©matheque, had raided the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their way on the star of American cinema Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous movie where music is a central character and live songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich surroundings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less lucid clothing, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells of one week the tribulations of a folk singer who does not get to beat and get angry with the whole earth.
He agrees to step back the replacements on his feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An Air of Documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but an integral one, with self-destructive behavior," said the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real characters of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then takes on documentary appearances, from the 33T invaded dusty music label sold by an old impatiable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and at the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character that crosses the movie permanently: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, a fellow of Llewyn Davis's fortune.
Questioned about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "large in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
GÃ©rard de Villiers, the author of SAS, died.
He'll never know the word "retirement."
Phenomenon of the French edition, GÃ©rard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years of age, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated it as "the author of spy novels that knew too much about it".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of the 198s and 199s opposed to the famous series of spying novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was traveling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published each year, GÃ©rard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 and 150 million all countries were confused," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building on the Avenue Foch a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, designating a stack of books on the low table between bronzes or ivory reported from the 130 arpent countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an aristocrat of the unharmed Austrian and contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the kittens of all the evils of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a wave of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," explained GÃ©rard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great reporters of the pre-war type Albert London, who went to the place and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added GÃ©rard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SASs are often pre-monitory: so, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980 he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique Ã  Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the capital of Mali.
I am not guessing, was defending GÃ©rard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to frequently troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his marguerite IBM writing machine dating from 1976 "all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
At the walls of his office are attached AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, GÃ©rard de Villiers separated these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa, where I have many readers.
GÃ©rard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes argue about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages among the great aeronautical builders about the width of the seats of the tourist class on the long-running flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air fair that takes place this month.
The conflict relates to the width of the seats proposed on long-distance flights to passengers of the economic class â which are not always the most brokered by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft submitted by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautics industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing states that it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft sought to sell even larger versions of their bi-motor long-running aircraft, possibly expecting a record of orders during the event that would take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft â in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats â is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its renovated "777X" can accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take steps on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in narrower seats than in regional turbo-powered aircraft," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight rose by 10% from 40 to 49 years, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the medium American of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival adheres to a headquarters concept dating from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch at the seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the width of seats and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the experience in the cabin does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the argument is a race at planes' orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, sufficient to bring the balance of US and European exports down.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest models of long-runners 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this in order to get more seats and make his planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passenger at the European Airbus plane.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go in pairs with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, the founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
The plane salesmen who tour the world take even with them a meter to check out the competing configurations.
While selling to offer comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautics industry to set up a size standard for seats will result, but that it could cause the 777X wave of sales to be forgotten.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellioton's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal for compensation for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aureoled from the victory of his boat at the American Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had had a negative vote on her remuneration.
The Oracle boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the poor performance of the group, which missed its growth goals, but he collected approximately $77 million related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the total fiscal year 2013, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange rate by 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Other tests are needed before the human test began, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausted all the methods available today on the market, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having its nicotine dose.
During tests, the vaccinated mice to whom nicotine was subsequently given continued their activity normally.
But the mice who had not been vaccinated "were calmed," said the researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will have no pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban Chief Killed by a Drone Â· Global Voices
Pakistan's Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed on a hit by an American drone in Pakistan on Friday, and was learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army, as well as the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this attack, which was carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
On the previous day, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Pakistani Taliban movement Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refused to modify the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several State ministers to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee, after they expired in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be offered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, Circular Quay's leases, which reported to the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, he acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, it wasn't that.
In any case, I'm certainly not with Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says a leader
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass an "authenticity" test
The government is currently studying the possibility of putting in place an "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while considering extending the law enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to hold unskilled positions or as a means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Failure statements on "foreigners returning to the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white people's work had to be protected â and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper refers to the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is authentic in case the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the company sponsoring it".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The troubled son of the 9-year-old man went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred as an emergency by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 Railway Project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baroness Kramer stated that the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and northern England from Â£32.7 to Â£42.6.
The British government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Barone Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British Ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read ebooks, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "air" mode.
Passengers may already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers review the decision that forces American carriers to perform significant work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated and requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with crew safety requirements.
Virgin, who had already told the CASA about her intention to extend the use of her entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (of the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend immediately to change that," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will take a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as to review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be securely stored under the seats or upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a catch of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the Pia side where a rix involving several people broke out on the Post side.
At least four minor injuries would be to be regretted.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the injured were taken care of.
Singapore's bonded lenders take advantage of middle classes that are forced to tighten their belts
In a pledged lender at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga places a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in," said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in certain parts of Southeast Asia â where household debt increases â that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, became this week the third bonded loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Taking jewelry into account is not just a quick way to get cash â $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga â but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledged lenders raise an annual effective interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fundor with a branch in the same mall.
However, on-demand lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit or salary proof checks, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to the lenders on pay as families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by a too laxist monetary policy in the advanced economies, low and middle-income families turn to lenders on pay to bridge the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio of households/gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while this rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the rise in costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [wage scale] are seeking to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to gain their personal effects in order to reach the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items in the 200 state-owned loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put the chain in granny gold and we'll come back looking for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest bonded loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the bonded loan sector that ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia â where it already has four shops â but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general manager.
The company will finance them using 60% of the US$66 million it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have exhausted the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that the payout not only offers lower rates than the other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property that they already own, and monetaryizing their personal property does not increase the debt of households," she says.
Leveraging is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who go to the mortgage lenders are not only those who have financial problems either.
Easy people in Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage Loan Shops to garage ingots of gold or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from every layer of society.
"It may be wise people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses who need cash to make a difficult move," adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiquÃ©, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into a Nazi uniform at the supermarket before he gets away with it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a brassard with the gamed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue, but "the time she arrived, he had already left without a scene," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were dumb mouths.
"You don't go out like this unless you want to draw attention," testified a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, to Cambridge News newspaper.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week at Asda's house for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
$325 million life plan for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering Health System has strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the aging of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned over four years, was decided upon by the Government's consultations with the independent Member of Parliament of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our view, will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million non-emergency surgery campaign.
2 600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for clinics with no appointments in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Ms.Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count largely "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for help it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will help greatly to remove Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the spokesperson for the opposition to health Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "a solution of fortune".
"The reason why we're here is that the state Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that takes almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and claim it's a bad day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France of the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the endless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into Lubricity or Sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring agency
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gases, declared the international chemical weapons monitoring agency Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The publication of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day in advance of the deadline for the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and to fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important stage of the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is thought that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and products, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which according to experts houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based activists, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, 61,067 civilians are estimated, including 6, 365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, 2,202 were also estimated to be deserters and about 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
About 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not provide any clarification.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while completing their mission, namely to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a prolonged civil war.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled â and seen destroyed â all declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Sappira's unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger provoked by the sentence imposed against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence pronounced against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive equipment used during the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, known as the Demolition Man, be sentenced to death for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged before the execution platoon," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 o'clock on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He hid in a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage â Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra â who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounded hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden with a view to restoring links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not go," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he had ridiculed himself for the grief he could have caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but do not call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music â but not talk on their mobile phone â under the new very expected guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to brighten them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the plane descends before landing and do not brighten them until the plane has set.
Under the new guidelines, air carriers whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground-handling, said the FAA.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with these changes.
âOnce the new policy is implemented safely â and we will work closely with the carriers for this â it will be beneficial for everyone,â Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in plane mode.
So there's still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered risky.
"Mobile telephones are a real problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
The airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to host Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who press for a easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company leaders commissioned a Kindle e-book reader liner and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices is at risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he believed that interference from aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft may interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitreuated bird of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helitruized after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water stream was raised on board a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The head of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from Northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help us."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we have commissioned the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, generally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to get involved in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their advice on specific policy issues â ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws â most business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster.
The single market has led to general discontent, with companies claiming that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area â 40% of the large, traditionally the most pro-European, companies even agree.
Finally, and what is more, our inquiry into business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its efforts to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that restores power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high â achieving a change in the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow 16% of the votes for the EU's maintenance during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for companies this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed friandies to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the parties caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, the Managing Director of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should allow to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of the Russian gas is transiting to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are âforeverâ eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wishes to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced on Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, resuming information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Poland), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode of the history of the English Navy that led to three Hollywood adaptations.
Some tens of residents, mostly descendants of Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this application.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, however, provided it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, next to Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin Province, northeastern China, was sentenced to life prison for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million yuan of wine pots, reporting the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of the state promised that justice would be as unenviable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mocks" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former oil giant Petrochina managers.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that "he had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had heard of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate by stressing that "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessment of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child's security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, who were keeping them in private, had them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had applied for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she was the head of child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the Council of New South Wales YMCA saying that for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "signature" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff shortly after the allegations were raised was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man expressed his views on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade of leadership, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his special role as the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, he would have responded, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to face and win the trophy of the Year's Horse, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toy and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable â which are of the same size â were praised for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presented against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap on the side in a casual way to parade his two-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was hailed by judges for its rare natural qualities of training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for her presentation and her personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been training since with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo."
They stood up to and against all, but the two flocked the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time that he was competing with Toffee and we were mad that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from Nantyglo village, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging it and applauding it."
He walked the entire length of the running track and even if it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad about animals â he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
From the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the year's Horse event â and I'm sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian demonstration said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer â Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be recast"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be recast, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "complete remodeling," said the regulator.
The order of "renewal" emanates from Guangdon's administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose administrative sanctions on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete remodeling of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately redraft the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apologies on the front page, writing that he had failed to verify his articles correctly.
Several important suspects recently made televised confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the verge.
The leak of radioactive vapour detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "without danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
Royale has just confirmed to us "the ship's unavailability" until " mid-November", "the time to take corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a naval defence specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heating.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles de Gaulle can deploy its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not call into question the ship's programme of activity" at nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate six-month maintenance period.
He had deployed Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "little damage", limited to the reactor's containment space, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a lot of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be finished.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money removed from force to taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their deprivation.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuous expenses and maintenance of boisterous ducks: a deficit cultural centre, a strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they will be sold to or demolished by the private company.
It is also important to note the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes in Fisheries and the Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline in the population, the use of water has significantly decreased throughout the territory.
Without saying waste, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for over 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don't think a sheep raiser makes it worse.
Discovery of a U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzad over a length equivalent to nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs emerged and went unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to prison for 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered as a result of the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that left the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British Police issues an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to report to a police station at the time and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange feared to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometry will invade our lives
Finish the passwords to tap to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier , Deputy Director General of Morpho , even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to privacy confirm this concern for biometry, but are concerned.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, wineries...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will build on new technologies, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are the fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very damaged fingers and their prints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data at their expense - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been conducted for some twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the ability to calculate the computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, director of Accentura R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Voitiet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
Uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognising one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is the one it claims to be).
To date, the identification concerned the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all citizens already fixed.
This ensures that a person does not try to usurp the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We collect images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that move freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: Take a quidam in a store, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, cellars, etc.) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the companion who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accentura.
But more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and placing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the key to the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and AngoulÃªme by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and large distribution signs: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in cash thirty seconds less, it's valuable," says the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure yourself by emphasizing the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are on a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which blocks if one tries to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, due to the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists, they, continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was struck with an apple of Â£1,000
A car driver was awarded a Â£1,000 fine for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was detected driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary prudence and attention.
The seven points removed from his permit led to a six-month withdrawal of a permit.
Howie was also sentenced to pay Â£90 and a surcharge for a victim of Â£100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the capital gains tax measure but expects a final decision of Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a stamp fee of 7% for properties that cost more than Â£2M and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property within a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the settlements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents Â£708 over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the right of stamp on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the subject, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate â the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market â in the prosperous sector in southwestern London from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year growth in year 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the tail movements of a dog are related to their mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs moved their tail further to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University, said: "Everyone knows that the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: âWe presented to dogs films where other dogs were included â either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor â and we were able to smuggle the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.â
When the animals saw a dog without expression tow the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that moved the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail mainly drifted to the left (once again from the point of view of the dog that moved the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet with other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, an invited professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious â the opposite of what was in the Italian study."
He said that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of movies or robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified â and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tails move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place on Friday in the concert hall The Hydro in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the Birmingham LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to happen in concert."
The performance at the Birmingham LG Arena will take place on 20 November, and that at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope â it is therefore a group of 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of the cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope FranÃ§ois decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix Catholiques stated that by February, the number of Cardinals electorate will probably decrease.
He stated that a pope generally named as many cardinals as he needed for the number of elected cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to focus on Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope had decided on his own.
"Now FranÃ§ois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that Francis asked for counsel from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation â it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally elected bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises â so we don't know who he will appoint."
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the inclination mechanism level.
As a result, the files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by approximately 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 pickups Sierra.
GM's share rate rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama occurred about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the roundabout of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all likelihood, work on the foundations has been carried out in this place for some time.
A Mitoyen foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I was driving and saw the wall collapse with a big smoke cloud, Sylvain Jean said, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the 50 who worked for a firm.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man didn't survive his grave injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Health and Safety Commission was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an elector from Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made laudable efforts by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a tragicly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the delay of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records in the evening and I fell asleep, this book brings me back to the time when policies inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and news reporters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the time.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries moved to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period in Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% positive views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change has really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Ousama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain listening to foreign leaders, nor the attacks of drone-innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor does it blame the whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that the White House's efforts to reduce the media silence are "the most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, as the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to enable him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been hearing for so long.
However, while the index of favorable opinions has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton at the Pennsylvania Mayors.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred in FlÃ©ron Street Retinne.
Jonathan's 26-year-old motorcycle from FlÃ©ron did not wear helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters might be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, which contests the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument to try to dismiss questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, she will have a direct interest in whether she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer moved on to the idea of remodeling the suffrage control system to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it in order to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take on his new "very serious" functions.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history, because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of bossian dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Millies (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boss dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species of a kind, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are called into question because of the progress of genetics.
Likewise, two species very close to morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific stocking dolphins and Atlantic stocking whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we may be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered by the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mix limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Mariannas pit, just 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is a long time that it changes.
RIB suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market from two sources close to the file, which shows again that the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RIB, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where 5.3 billion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RIB employees to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests from regulators for information.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RIB had sent e-mails and instant messages to and from a former trader to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RIB in 2010 and was allegedly suspended from his position as European cash trading manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash trading manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
The UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities â the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority â examine the allegations made about bankers that would have agreed to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests from regulators for information, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been called into question this year because of the low currency volatility that limits speculators' opportunities.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the low-cost market".
The news came the same day when Credit Switzerland announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange office this week after causing a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been framed, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed that he had never seen such a "baked" investigation.
I was told by Ruby to believe in The Canadian Press that the police had "ignified or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual driver, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair chose knowingly not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Ms. Ruby's words as "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair claimed that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships declining at mid-term, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are going down on Friday to mid-seat, led by some disappointing news companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Furthermore, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of inflation to 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street precipitate an opening of the rising US shares, after two consecutive sessions of withdrawal.
In the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of ACC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published declining results this morning and announced the creation in-house of a "bad bank" structure comprising 38 billion pounds of most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45 per cent) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300's increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy goes well, as John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank, says.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the downturn of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its rebellion against the US currency and has reached a lower than two weeks to $1,3517 in the sitting.
These same conjectures support the euro areaâs bond market in reverse.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's Health System Reform Act was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act â which requires citizens to apply health insurance by 2014, subject to the penalty of having to pay a fine â and declared that it was constitutional under the government's tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the remaining 2,700-page sections of the Act and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered in the event of loss of all federal funding from the Program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in high school in 2012, including the designated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by M. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Locking between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 in the evening during a violent siege on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, after a depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell shot during an Israeli army raid to the east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug up by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a raid of about 100 metres inside the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zohuri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen by defending the territory during a Zionist occupation in Khan Youns.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug up in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiquÃ©.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive weapon directed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
On the other hand, Israel struck an air military base in northwestern Syria, aimed at a missile shipment for the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, reported the Al-Arabiya satellite chain on Thursday, 31 October.
One U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Citing "exclusive resources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday dawn in an air defence base at Sonar JablÃ©, near LatakiÃ©, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Dance Dance: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos GymnopÃ©dies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tic and black to white.
A white screen served as a bottom wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simple line, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole piece: an enthralling of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate it, emerge in the stream.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group to unit (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning", where Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front-stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monoton in the scream, and will continue by dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up suffocating and choking.
As does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that fade or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, was imposed, with his tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt's shapes, open a wider and giboyous imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers awed by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the intrusion, are richer.
The scene is partly grey-plated, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers were talking to play the scores.
Their misunderstandings in music, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, couples pass in love dueos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
As familiar as Chouinard, with red noses, there are mockings in very polarized men-women's love parades.
Loves are carnasses, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of coitous bodies, beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after the salvation.
A clown comes back to the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce into a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness pervade, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning Nordl patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nordl patents has begun an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it has co-signed to the pole during the sale of patent auctions that took place after the Nordl bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nordl patents for $4.5 million, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies before the U.S. Seat Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in connection with Internet search terms, have indicated the trial conclusions, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which gives fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Nordl's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally proposing $4.4 Md.
After losing the Nordl patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 million, a partial market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it violated and continued to violate those patents," said the trial findings.
Rockstar claims more damage and interests against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's attorney.
The on-site expert by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life forecast of the two victims is always committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his girlfriend, was beside him and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of LiÃ¨ge, it was in helicopter, it was in an ambulance," said Burgman JosÃ© Paulet, who came down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisne's civil protection stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected President to swear
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investment, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph would mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he swore the oath of investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding to Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before the 18 judges in the black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to better days, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life â absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and severely repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to hail the new President and, starting with the Presidential Fast of the Moubarak years, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the uncharismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mohamed Morsi said, in a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges present in the panelroom where he swore an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his speech of investment.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on your guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand...", filled with thousands gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and the former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime in Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former former President, deposed him.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has slowed the rise in the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six main performers having lower than expected.
Detroit's three major manufacturers display two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake blow is primarily explained by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first half of the month".
GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For his part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite increases over one year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 16.35 GMT while Ford gave in 1.1%.
Renault leaded in Stock Exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses the biggest decline of the SBF 120 index in Paris Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that he has reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that Renault was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," said a Parisian broker trader.
Under the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese builder 15% of the French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a site of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another one was severely injured Friday night by shots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a neo-Nazi club Golden Dawn in the western suburb of Athens, was learned from police source.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guardians of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and blocked the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, were charged with participating in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two league matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Exposed against the BarÃ§a for having hit Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In one press release, his club said "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Almost 50,000 households are electricity deprived throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, MontÃ©rÃ©gie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of panics with nearly 7,000 private homes in the metropolitan area and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast to rise and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started strong, in particular with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are in a good position to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and tax," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the recreation travel sector increased during the second half of the year, making it possible to offset a domestic business travel market in a slight decline.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector recorded good results, while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and had to benefit from the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unsullied strangers opened the fire this Friday on a hotel close to the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with retired employees.
Assailants fled, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General Police Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives almost any tourists since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will need to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow â the first subjects to be reviewed radically.
It will make changes in other basic materials next year.
On the other hand, Ofqual, the Bureau of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus as to the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," insisting that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time at maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore offer about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the use of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths â as well as the greater importance given to the subjects contained in the international classifications â would probably encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The programme will focus more on the "problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a law adopted in July in that State and which largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a Muy gun for Halloween
Juveniles aged 9 and 13 were making door-to-door calls for candy on Halloween night.
One of the riversides of the Much visited neighborhood by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
MÃ¼ller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
MÃ¼ller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily newspaper by relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, were in operation as well as during the summer of 1949, MÃ¼ller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a paper obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, MÃ¼ller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," said Mr.Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the inner left pocket were his service conditions with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The President of the Central Jewish Council of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the cruelest Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly on the foot," he insurmounted in the newspaper.
Heinrich MÃ¼ller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near YaoundÃ©, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one arm broken, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequels for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying her father in clinics and crowded hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the U.S. ratio is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford to pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 surgical acts for free last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at YaoundÃ© Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they set out in vans after having fixed the medical equipment on the roof and went through difficult terrains to go to the villages where help is most needed.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy slopes.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sing and dance and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle â with his great smile and energy overflowing â is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beequilles, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate â a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, city hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the waking room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team to stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work it accomplished.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts for free in the past year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to getting this hospital to live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around YaoundÃ©.
It is this second job, he explains, that funds 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in YaoundÃ©, their pensions, transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to extinguishing.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Curious, the academics have long painted to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Probably, but stressing its weak for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but by ignoring the hidden work and the publishers' underground writing.
Heir of the chair that occupied Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True again, but knowing that such a sacred oil cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great waker, animator and federationr of their work, but noting that he showed little propensity to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, equipped with a lively eye-blowing and slumbering, but incurably delightful.
The two books published by Nora soon two years have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely render him justice.
However, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation that has to be jumped as feet attached from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brochant to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive knot of the French identity.
Why these dramatic appeals to national unity?
Identity: it's a concern of the time.
Here too, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism requires, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
What Pierre Nora's up to is something else.
He does not become an heir to eternal Francity, he refuses to define it.
Concerned analyst of familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
The company, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so durablely settled within its borders, so anciently framed and firmly grounded, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulishes, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that breaks the national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding to deny it; rather concerned to regain its sacrality and the desire for unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head off from the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American getaway could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But American cosinage only makes it better to highlight what is our own.
There, men who had left their former Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men filled with an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There's a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confidant.
Here the founding fathers are always honored, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose role is hard to make, and who have been in between.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as well as mistakes to catch up and trials to resume.
France that leaves, France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could cover the torn robe of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this III Republic, a central moment and creator, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: praising those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the students everything in the old France prepared obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only a time.
Here it is again in debate, swept by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, firstly, the portrait of the historian, who should book a few surprises.
We found out that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The band was located in the center of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here, more than a half century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had avoided the initial exercise of the the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he has ended up doing it.
True in a less steep form, more bursting and more subtle.
But we are not mistaken, just as binding.
Because much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Removed from Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team filming a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released about 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has been involved in the establishment of the Hostages of the World's Hostages Association, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained over 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Ferret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grice military hospital Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h set of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, among others, in Beirut.
When I was released, I found myself in the trunk of a car where I met - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tending.
They'll drop us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
The French bring us to the Embassy of France.
It's the time of the first strokes of threads to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirts at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there by helicopter, we took a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on the French soil come about?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back, and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane ladder, finding them with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car Roussin drives.
The bikers pull their burrow to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
That night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins some sort of life-rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like a vacation.
How did medical examinations and debriefing DGSE happen?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grice the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and encounter with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my president of the association "Otages du monde" that allow me to distance myself, and it seems to me much more interesting to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there's a semantics problem.
It is necessary to qualify for "political" hostage-taking hostages - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why don't we say to the hostages "you've violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice" ?
But I think it's sound, legitimate, sensible.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger is rampant in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the late President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial that arises a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontation broke out in Alexandria, police made use of tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel blames 9 American States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all members of the military are entitled to an identification card from the Department of Defence and benefits that come with it," said the Minister in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" established in their territory, he denounced them, challenging them to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, they cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine states border began in Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implantations of the Texan National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texan Act and the Federal Gender Marriage Act.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in HyÃ¨res
The sixth edition of Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in HyÃ¨res.

At only 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything so long as he goes back to competitors who exceed it by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Asked Him About a Drug Case Â· Global Voices
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media outlets.
A video given to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a hanger for cannabis.
On Thursday, he ran away from his property several journalists came to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31, that a case of anger had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The kitten was found in Argenteuil on October 25 and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rage was confirmed by the Pastor Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation was undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 including," states the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement states.
The departments now call on persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or on a skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been free from rage since 2001, and this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, not free," the communiquÃ© said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "Aboriginal" case of recorded rage dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rage on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated on time," the departments recall and it is communicable for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama Moves Back on Health System Reform
President Obama came back yesterday to his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called "an effervescence in the present" about the terminations, President Obama urged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You will win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who are self-employed were forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed âpainfullyâ.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her micro-cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has consistently asked Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now boasts millions of Americans.
Vettel sneezes a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the runway.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 World Champion, pulled for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an auto brand, from his stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the test.
It is likely that it will have another special helmet on Sunday for the race, to mark its fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party from the suburbs
Let's not fool ourselves, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusurds.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I speak of suburbanness, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent, its project, presented Thursday at a press conference in its birthplace in Aubervilliers, from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods above all.
My proposal No. 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorial attache, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre ChevÃ©nement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There's only the extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme - accessible on the Internet - from many topics intended to speak to the suburban inhabitants and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of housekeepers...
He remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it is likely to be fair, he recognizes."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermune assures that he already has seven leaders in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails that I have received since yesterday do not all emanate from the suburbs" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a slowdown in the US's defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, on many occasions, that espionage "was too far off in an inappropriate manner."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities began.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have come to know certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the borders, but insisted on the fact that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and arrest them before they act?
We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage issue and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the Chair of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Affairs Subcommittee of the American Senate, at an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some of the United States' allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO's allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified allied espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congress trip, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "tender firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can modify our surveillance programmes to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down Thursday, led by Shell's poor results and the following announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian Appeals Imprisoned in Thailand Â· Global Voices
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely alleged to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket District Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her earlier on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the history of all the plays.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the Phuket outskirts rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
âWeâve obviously had a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,â Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bond of 50,000 bahts was paid.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent killing in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to recoup its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came differently than with RSCA's cars.
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of Anderlecht's Royal Sporting Club against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, announced Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the police area Brussels-mid, Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to attend this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from an old border post in Rekem to the PSG stage," the spokesperson said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefectures stated that measures had been taken to carry out arrests or even guards in sight," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
Vision diversity has been taking place in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, be they stem or come from it.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify themselves to all this," explains Vision Diversity President AÃ¯da Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support to staff in the transformations that we experience, within the student clientele," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azduz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion at all levels: language, school, social and cultural.
