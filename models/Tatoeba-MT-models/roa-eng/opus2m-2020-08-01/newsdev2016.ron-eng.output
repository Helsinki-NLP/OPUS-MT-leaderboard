Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive pattern of corruption on Petrobras oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu would be sued for charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Another fourteen persons will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers' Party, held in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of the company services of Petrobras.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers Party taken into custody for the links to this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of the former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from 2003 to 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors stated that Dirceu developed the bribe takeover scheme in Petrobras, accepted bribes while in function and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the purchased votes.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribe and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for swollen contracts.
The ‘miraculous’ recovery of a surviving student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralytic teenager who had been shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan had told him that he would never be able to go.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the Peshawar Army public school last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for the operation, will be discharged later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a regular Tuesday morning, Mohamed was sitting at first aid time and listening carefully to his teachers.
Even then, seven armed men dressed in uniforms of security officers entered public military school.
They wore belts with explosives and had a simple mission to accomplish: to kill all men, women and children in their path.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots out.
The terrorists came in and started killing our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater as the carnage unfolded.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
He said "oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the brass down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the ones in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and called for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people such as Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
Eventually, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as “fearing” when he arrived at the hospital.
"He spent the last [a few] months lying in bed, without being able to move on one side, says Malik.
He was weak, there was a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to reseal the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the surgery, Mohamed stood up and began to take steps and walk.
We're not expecting such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the weapons images drawn by him next to the school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but psychological trauma he passes through and now is unimaginable.
"My fury has not dropped," he confesses.
In my school, little kids were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, consoles him on the rise, and says: “I see my son going again.”
He'll be able to keep his life going.
The “Super Voice” service in Three provides better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
The Three Mobile Phone Provider launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve the reception inside buildings and in rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to a better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more locations than they have been before.”
The sights are preparing for the pantomime season
The pantomime season is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them now preparing for this year's season.
Now, at the Christmas theater, some of the biggest names in the showbusiness are taking part.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and second in the role of the fairy.
These reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I do nothing, I feel guilty”
Steven Wilson was recently designated the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most hardworking musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three prizes at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating work of art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, the most well-known being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyls and his loaded schedule and explained how Matt Berry's comedy actor got to open up his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era and I remember that then I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a record, you went with him home, had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing left to really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you get absorbed in the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it can't be that way if some kids too young to remember vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially care about?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started from the idea of restoring the collection I was 15 years old, but I went beyond that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a lead to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the day of the record stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of suggestive albums to gather some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I had to keep the project being launched only on vinyl.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a downloaded variant to high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I'm focusing on longer music, there's one thing I've always prized above all else: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test due to the fact that they always put the emphasis on the melodic and atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first one, it will be a version of the Hand. Erase show that I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will rather be an incursion into my history, being oriented more towards the fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the second night?
And me and the others on the tournament team are big fans of [the comedy series on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always quote from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
Seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have remixed albums of such troops as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does this affect your own music?
I am not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, without a doubt, the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed with work in today's music world and I don't say that proudly, because please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remixing work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I was lazy, I don't think I would have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European tournament.
A new contract brings back jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans hired a part of the airline staff who had lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the restored company in Northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport employees to the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members got their job back.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that made up a large part of the airline business.
The bankruptcy has caused more communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliamentary for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to reassign 18 members of the full-time Skytrans staff as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have increased by 100%, 78 staff being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to see Skytrans expand its flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves as Head of York and Stramtore Torres, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights return per week for QGC staff and entrepreneurs from Brisbane to the locations of Chinchilla and Taroom, in its 36-seater Dash-8 aircraft, starting Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following an auction procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a Queensland company," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentarian and fresh Mummy Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a higher supply of milk to avoid losing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be part of the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the rising stars of the government, Kelly O'Dwyer, was advised to make a greater supply of milk for her newborn to prevent breastfeeding from intervening in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out which is the most appropriate approach for a breast-feeding parliamentary, in accordance with the current orders.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
According to the current orders - the set of rules governing the conduct of parliamentarians in the Chamber - breast-feeding mothers obtain voting power in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip did not know about this exemption before consulting the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, in this matter.
Things rushed on two occasions when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and he couldn't fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if parliamentary thought of making a bigger milk supply instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, a Queensland parliamentary officer, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Afterwards, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer said for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when he was told to make a higher supply of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the construction of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national parliamentary from Queensland, was promoted as a disciplinarian by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the February-year censorship test.
O'Dwyer, in the image with Amanda Rishworth from the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott was faced with a motion of censure that wanted his removal from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible for Deputy Discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the front page of the newspapers, after he had discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to give up to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
He's one of the three parliamentarians who became moms this year.
Laburist Party spokesman Catherine King said on Wednesday that voting powers for nursing mothers were introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven]," she wrote on Twitter.
The manager of the discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said on Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more women than me to see in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," the Prime Minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure sustained to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the December recession.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull may have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's brothers as Prime Minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he had just ended up in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
The representatives of the interest groups spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly does the country's biggest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull itself has set the free trade agreement with China as its initial objective.
In his first speech in which he announced on the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized "the revolting economic shocks" of the Labour Party on that problem and expressed concern over the racist temptation of critics.
"In the context of ChAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the country's 100 largest companies) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the Harper Analysis recommendations.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply to large mergers and other contracts in order to determine whether consumers will suffer from the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the Australian Affairs Council and major retailers.
Turnbull now realizes that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped to burn to state that if Turnbull follows Harper's recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that all the business environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to make and by that he let Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business (which is on Harper's recommendation) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could contribute to the prevention of breast cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women between 60 and 80 years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their “significant” probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts multiplication tables under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard seems to have completely misunderstood the arithmetic.
The negative character in the Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one or one is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one or one makes one, it means two doesn't have value, because one or the other he doesn't have effect himself.
One times one do two, because the square root of his four is two - so what is the square root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he dropped out of the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wires, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one times one" and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
Rolling Stone's editor described Howard's creations as "a more complex, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, infinite-form brick that is connected with copper wire or magnetized wire".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for improved construction brick applications").
Also, the actor in the "Following an idol" also says that Pythagora Einstein and Tesla would "crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three to four years old why does a bubble take a round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that one times one make one," he said.
There will no longer be need to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know one times one makes two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check it out in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star played little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of The Weeknd's "I Can't Feel My Face".
This week, Grande's name has been appearing in the press.
On the same day it had also been at Good Morning America, where it opened the show with the incident of the doughnut.
Taco Bell hopes that the restaurants "Cantina" in which it will be served will become points of interest urban
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the chain of fast food restaurants in Mexican style will open a new location in the Chicago Wicker Park area, offering a tapas menu of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first place to test the “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants of the chain, which are addressed to young people, concentrated in increasing numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has almost 6,000 restaurants in the USA, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average payment note of 7 USD Taco Bell, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation that "looks for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it's like to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow it," said US TODAY Neil Borkan, franchisor Taco Bell who will operate the Chicago location.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared with the traditional offers Taco Bell, in an open kitchen, where "you will be able to see the food yourself" before it is prepared, told the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Seventy-five Starbucks cafes now offer evening menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an indoor yard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the chain of fast food restaurants also wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a top quality culinary line in 2012, when he opened Cantina menus and expensive burritos, to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If successful, the Cantina restaurants will represent another step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of them will be like "Cantine".
They set their phones in the middle of the night: Elton John courted Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night, only a few days after the British artist publicly declared that he would like to meet Russian politician to discuss the legislation of ancient Russia together.
The British song, declared gay, tried without success to obtain an interview with Putin while in Russia, in November 2014, one year after it challenged the protests of this country and held two concerts in 2013, in a troubled period in the history of this state, following the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homosexual propaganda" in the children's ranks.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to fans: "Although I am gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I couldn't write these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "song" all in the NRP folder
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a stinging conviction, singing in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday he heard at the High Court of Marriage and Justice in the case file where he was tried with his son or Alin Cocos, the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensations in the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told judges in his memory how he helped Gheorghe Stelian business in the case of damages from the ANRP, instead demanding that he be tried sooner and take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos has shown that he has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he has been in contact with him after several real estate businesses.
He said Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at the NRP.
Then I found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money I told him I'd give him in more trances.
I promised him political support, to stay in function.
"Diacomatu then told me that he was helping me, but he needed support," Dorin Cocos pointed out in the courtroom.
He also said that later, through a knowledge, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who then was head of the Central Compensation Commission, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacoma already had political support, I gave her five million euros.
To Dumitrean's hair a million euros, to Dragos Bogdan I gave 800,000 euros.
I need all this money in the trance to make sure the file's solved.
"So I told them, to solve the file, to repay," Cocos said.
Asked why he ended up doing these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also pointed out that "it was notoriety that all the members understood before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All functions were political in the NRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I would help him politically just to calm him down," Cocos concluded.
Bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was in the DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, when he filed new documents in the "Turkeys - Ruins".
Victor Ponta ran away from DNA with a European Court of Justice document
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file where he is researched for false in inscriptions under private signature, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents that could have been sent by counsel.
It wasn't like that, because the prosecutor didn't have time, the primer leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents on the record.
I wanted to file the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other at work, because as long as the taxes are paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said at the exit of DNA.
Ponta also said that, in either view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read out the decision of the European Court and call it back to the hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disqualification of the file.
Iohannis enjoys his non-television mandate
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own a device like that, because you pay your TV fee once you charge your energy.
But if you're the head of the state, things change dramatically.
Because, in practice, it is assumed that the title of the President of Romania is also included in the connection to everyday realities.
President Iohannis sinks daily in total silence in his office or at Cotroceni
Only to the surprise of his closest men at Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have a TV in the president's office.
And after not looking at TV - no programs, not even at German posts RTL or Pro Sieben -, the president doesn't listen to radio stations and does not read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" that, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Iohannis is pleased to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-sustainment, in which the only breach is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockade to which, through its passiveness, the head of the entire state pushes the activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although he's spent so much time since his installation, Iohannis hasn't yet signed the statements of loyalty of more than half of the employees of the President's Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both from a human point of view and legal.
Silence and peace
Those in the presidential entourage are already clear that no one and nothing can harm "feng shui" in the office of the head of state.
Where's quiet and peace.
What's right, only after nine hours without a minute (no more, no less!) in the morning, when the former building of Sibi asks for the presence of the officials.
A habit that probably didn't stand out from the time he was driving the city's primary town on Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in his office, there's already been no legends, being already people from Cotroceni Palace who have come to bow down to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have a radio device.
Only at this rate will he meditate as soon as he can in the dark, because the lighting machines can also hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just fine.
Also, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "positive monitoring" of the President's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of the state will receive on the bioru its content.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that he was banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night television broadcasts in which he was criticized, but he asked every morning, with priority, for negative news.
That doesn't mean the music as it helped him, but, that's what, the gesture matters!
And at least he can never have the excuse that he was not well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, after all, you love her and mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, under whatever formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the President's Administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in office and which must also bear and sign it.
Only since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed to confirm even half of these statements, although it must have happened in no more than 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of Cotroceni Palace staff now have an uncertain situation.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be thrown out.
Only that they all didn't get any negative opinion!
So, at one point, I mean, I can come anytime to the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, so many people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That until the president decides whether to kick him out or confirm him on the posts, the decision being strictly his.
Authorities said a teenager was launching an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia in August when the law enforcement authorities dismissed the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the president of Homeland Security during a Sunday interview, said a source for Fox News.
"We are paying close attention to threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francis was not referred to as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
the common information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, in which it is stated that the adolescent planned to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, having as target “a foreign denitar during a high-level event”.
The bulletin mentions that the minor has radicalised through social networks.
He may have suffered from mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man’s disease.
On Sunday, McCaul also acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" on the whole nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret allocation" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great security risk... but, as the date approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The Fae of Collooney, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, thus discovering a frightening story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest has wounds caused by the knife. It has such a trail in the left hand, which suggests that it tries to defend itself.
The skeleton is one of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was killed in battle or in a personal fight," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"He was probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents showing that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is still an unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"Has a meter of 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends 1.5 million dollars to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent almost $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and young children perceive food" is run by the University of Chicago and, until now, it has established that the young are not willing to eat smooth food from other people or that other people have sneezed.
According to the project's financier, "appropriate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets".
There is evidence to suggest that the first dietary models of babies and young children have long-term health consequences.
The premise for this study is that there is a lack of research on how babies look at food.
"Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have dedicated little attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food," said the financier.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in babies and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the food field".
Children between three and six years of age “know more about food than babies and young children,” but are “extremely mofturous consumers”.
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" television show was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, aged 41, who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the Roane County sheriff's office brought the arrest warrant to Lien's home in Harriman on 3 September, where they say they found it empty under a blanket on the couch.
Officers said that Lien refused their demands to dress.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien has been brought with him more charges, including the aggravated bodily injury incident in April in which he says that Lien has entered a police car with the personal car.
He still doesn't know if he's got a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose body in decomposition was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northeast London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and the detectives say his body has probably been in the Epping forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was well known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to learn from the Green Lanes community information that helps us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist spot, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat rides.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area in recent weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity, come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Join Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on paid maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo’s executive director, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but she was going to take a very short maternity leave and “work in” her spare time, the 40 - year - old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the super woman or nothing.
But is Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, to be to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Office for the Application of Work Standards, just got a government job in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss amazed her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, grab a break from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a day's maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he thought about it.
But he listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had completed three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel was unable to apply the same strategy.
The four months of vacation he took were completely missed.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone who tries to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not put any value on the fact that you will become a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice President of the Capital Group Assets Administration Company, says that any woman employed who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggle between the quality of mother and job as "a constant struggle".
The secret not to dive is to have "an incredible family with you" and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that aren't going to be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at the interior amenities") and just go through it.
Choi says she took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting and you stay up all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and stated that her investment portfolio performance had nothing to suffer.
When she entered the finance industry after the university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same way, she says.
Today, approximately 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up the job, then start again don't have the same chances at top-paid posts well, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move on is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know that their mother actually helps to save lives.
Posner, the founder and director of the Centre for Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most people don't allow themselves to believe that," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
He also helped with technology, she says, because he can stop the car and answer the phone after he takes his children or respond to an e-mail from the walk.
The Jonglat between maternity and a requesting career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to an end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as noodles, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning the very low wages, the poor health system and the lack of paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her baby while she was getting a scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the health care offered by the scholarship, the labor leader was able to take a maternity leave for just two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining the programmes set up by common agreement and accepting that effective work does not mean that you are out of programme.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, says Mosko, is the additional pressure to activate in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mother's clothes" is one of the most serious insults).
“The image is part of our job – it lifts you up or pulls you down,” she explains.
Moscow's "permanent trade" for its multiple roles to work harmoniously means keeping its appearance and a beautiful bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes to fall a toy-two.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, President and Executive Director of the New York Housing Authority, which handles over 400 000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career do not mean to talk about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little improper.
It looks more like a swing," she says.
Three-child mother, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a maternity leave of seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important time for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (“cheap as therapy”) still breast-feeds.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly for parents" environment, in which it is allowed to be late due to a child, and the response to e-mails should not necessarily be sent from the office.
"The concept and the notion of family have changed and changed very much," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russians say they tricked Elton John about a call from Putin.
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, Russian President, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss homosexual rights.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn't true: despite an exuberant Instagram post in which he thanked the Russian leader for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night certainly wasn't Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorous people admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became the spokesperson of President Dmitri Peskov.
"But it seems that Elton John was actually waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really a conversation with right-wing people that we gave," he said to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.”
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and charming of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements about speculation.
The story is based on the comments made by the singer on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridical" attitude toward homosexuals while the LGBT rights militia in Kiev, particularly criticising a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet [putin], let's talk," John said to the BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer sparked a lack of confidence in observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said that “he looked forward to meeting [the president] face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the joked phones of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played the role of Peskov and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked by the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but in Kremlin no such request was received from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English”.
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with similar grammatical errors.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public prank, local media outlets already suspected that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the pranks made to the telephone politicians they record and post them on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls joked to public people, then publishing recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to prank Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television by imitating Anton Gerashchenko, direct adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke with the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, over six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests after massive fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, then president's adviser Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the chairman of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, the former USSR President Mihail Gorbachev, Kiev Mayor and the Vitali Klitschko boxing champion and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who had tricked him into apologizing for his athletes' drunken behavior, were included among his victims.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukasenko, becoming the son of the outgoing Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovici.
It was so convincing, that the person at the other end, whose voice resembled Lukasenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, said for The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with such an "irelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain his position in Russia.
Moskovsky Komsomolets opened an online reader survey, in which 39% of respondents felt Putin and John should meet, and 22% felt that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people die prematurely each year because of air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for heating homes and cooking, but research shows that an equally alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, where they are the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should trigger an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory disease.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which is estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the journal Nature, was the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by these, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel power plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of fumes, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized dangers.
Consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, the research found that the agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of Germany's Max Planck Chemical Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of the global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from the excessive use of fertilizers.
The ammonia reacts with the exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main reason of the deaths due to pollution of the air from eastern America, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Leslieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing one fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has only caused 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
The pollution of air by the plant, especially by coal-operated people, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55 000 deaths per year, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid regions and with a lot of dust, caused almost a fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, being responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
“The overlap between the high pollution level and the large number of residents says their word on public health, but nothing is known about pollution sources responsible for premature deaths,” Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health globally.
All particles are currently supposed to be as toxic.
But if those caused by the burning of fuels are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and from policy makers."
Dr. Oliver Wild, atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “Study really stresses the need for air quality control, to avoid these deaths, especially in highly populated areas in Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tensions more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister talks about attitudes that remind us of Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after the border with the Serbs, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest of treating refugees "with bat and inserted".
Hungarian diplomacy reacted hard by talking about the "extremist and lying" claims, but Victor Ponta did not get any closer and accused government officials from the neighboring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
Note that it is not for the first time when Ponta tries to strain Roman-Hungarian relations through statements made at delicate times or with an electoral character.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is with our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with beatings and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has put himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but we're going to have the task of solving the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," Victor Ponta said months, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Czechia was recently at the centre of the critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that shook Victor Ponta's position make him make the statements "extremist and lying".
The Pregnant with Roman Business from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, Mediafax informaza, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian DFAIT, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-hungarian lies", stresses Budapest's diplomacy.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from Hungarian government representatives - but read the account below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a man and a European citizen, of the mentality and attitudes that Europe has seen only in the 1930s-40s!", Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He claims that, like other European policies, he has the "duty" to attract attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-Semit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all types, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Weapon, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries that run from those refugees!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in superiority of European values", and "what we see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with these goals and values."
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian soldiers grabbed and shot or killed some children or women in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
The dispute also took place UDMR President Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "feeling approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader states that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or Roman citizens, he showing that the fence could even help our country not become an intense transit route for migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, to say, that we don't have to hysteria, to take this whole thing as something against Romania and not to use it to worsen the relationships between the two governments anyway, because that's not the case.
I think any sentimental, visceral approach is not right.
"We have to see the rational side, see why we have come here and we have to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens and does not stop the free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer in 2012 to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has proposed for more than three years now that the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, be removed as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the Western countries and the Russian Federation, says The Guardian.
Former Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
From 2012 to now, tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also stated that during the talks, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the beginning of peace talks between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One -- we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we must look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, relating the position of the Russian ambassador.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," continued the former President of Finland.
Russia has officially firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the course of four and a half years of war, insisting that it cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize the Assad regime and to defeat the extremists of the Islamic State.
The live Internet programme of Ancient 3 will be available against cost
Antenna 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November the program or live will be able to be watched online against cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "writer to viewers", the news post of the Intact Trust states that "we do this with a tight heart, wanting to stay with us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antena 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort, which has assumed permanent re-engineering and focusing on quality".
We managed to support ourselves, under conditions where the online and offline distributors contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the TV news program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online platform Antena Play, where, moreover, they were most often accessible exclusively and the videos of the Antene.
Reports show that populations of marine animals and plants have halved in the last 40 years
The crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions to the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a challenge for almost all marine life, says the WWF Blue Living Planet report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, on which many other species depend, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercially valuable fish, such as macro and tuna, have fallen vertigo by three quarters compared to the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to worsen as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, which leads to a directly proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, Chief Marine Policy Advisor at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which degrades coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we resemble the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the Indices of the Living Planet, a database maintained by the London Zoo, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great diversity of marine species, from fish, marine turtles and sea peas - an animal similar to a worm, with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, CEO of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in commercial profit species.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macro, tuna and sardines - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without showing signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital source of food and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning of the problems we may face as a result.”
Seaweed: deep-sea "passions", which capture the rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, the coverage area has decreased by 30%.
Mangroves: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to worsen.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine change globally.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism he would have been brought by his former Liverpool teammate El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticises the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard's Senegalese radio station Grupo Futurs Medias, with quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked colored people."
Gerrard's lawyers have denied any charges of racism to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who has made himself public before and before his bad opinion of Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how I can go things backwards," he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and he doesn’t care about Liverpool,” he continued.
For example, the way he spawned a huge and viscous phlegm in a Celtic fan in a game of the Uefa Cup at Parkhead in March 2003 represents evidence of his contemptuous and spiteful behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most notorious night being Celtic Park.
The Senegalese expatriate was questioned by the police after the episode of the spit and amended with the equivalent of his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of £60,000 being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's former friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the league victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "zealous".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the football world, the biggest football experts put me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is fled whenever he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of Dancing With the Stars, Alek Skarlatos does not just play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, say producers.
"We use many categories and always look for the most popular of the moment," said Deena Katz, the executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his printer after that.
It's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he competed at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized an armed man with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what might have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
Afterwards, Skarlatos, 22-year-old, sentinel in the National Army, which grew up near Sacramento, received a call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although he may have anticipated some local appreciation - Friday in Sacramento, there was a parade in the honor of the young man - he did not expect so many positive reactions or invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Near in a million years I would have thought I would receive this offer," Skarlatos confessed Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show of Monday night he acknowledged that he was "excited" he acted as a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining scores that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said she offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said that they want to keep a place in the show for contestants invited on the last hundred meters, as is the case with Skarlatos, who grew up in the public eye.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who played a weapon attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When he appeared at Good Morning America to tell about the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC sister program to avoid crossing through all the media dams.
He supported his five-minute plea, then waited anxiously to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in the DWTS.
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago the fight in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he's in the mood for dancing.
Skarlatos, who is on a short vacation from the National Guard, didn't even see a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just him highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with their hands and legs amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, last season's favorite fan contestant and finalist, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's constant "follow-up" and "the insistent messages," she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will look and how the image of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up the rather rigid military position.
But Katz says he's confident that he'll adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To move on, he needs to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that until now he has had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program represented the hardest struggle, being forced to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was acclaimed in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Altogether, I've been home for four days.
There is a risk in the capture of a person who attracts media attention, but it is not customary to be in the light of the spotlights, Wade's executive producer said.
And the show wants to make sure the contestant handles and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"We would never want Alek to say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's hold his fists for fun.
McRib from McDonald's comes back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"At the McGib 2015 promotion, there are approximately 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb to The Times in an e-mail.
In the US there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu that they believe their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video showing the reality.
According to the video, the McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at the McDonald's restaurants that attend.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is located in Sevastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones recordings would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones band may join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - have recently met in London and made "clear recording plans," as he says.
On Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years there have been many tournaments on stadiums and they have played in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the last, they reinterpreted the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, collaborating with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a career of five decades.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in an interview with the guitarist: “As always, Richards’ harsh voice is a more kind than distinguished instrument....
But Richards stirs emotion in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards claims that the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any further details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already passed through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor on television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult has reaffirmed itself in the role of a typical inexpressive in the television series "Situation of crisis" and in films such as "Casmar Chiefs".
The first film he worked on as a director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems, play in the film.
The film has as its subject a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I never saw the book like that," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of the evening benefited from an introduction by the programme director of the festival, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm in particular for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" from the late '80s and the early '90s, which he worked on. "I didn't meet too many fans "Hogan Family" said Bateman sec when he climbed the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, who was 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has in the center a family named Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by setting up a bank robbery with the academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Baman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what is the story of the children who want to evolve into adult life has been directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very typical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story I feel attached to and I understand in depth," he added, "and although I did not try to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abair was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Treezing to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to record the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the premiere for months.
The author of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the film Bateman "a clever and caustic adaptation" that "makes the clichés of the much-exploited type of dysfunctional family too much and dissects the mission, sometimes for a lifetime, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet- bitter, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and said that Bateman "provides visible progress and greater maturity as a film director with this structured, but never too clever or mechanical adaptation".
After the screening for months, when Bateman and Walken went up to the stage for the question session, the audience long overrun the multi-stakeholder Walker.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walker said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which the film director's work changed, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scenes.
His concentration is truly amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the barn, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and becomes clearer.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to run movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting that... actor wants a close-up.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman confessed that, after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walker for Caleb's role, but also about Carter Burwell's composer for the soundtrack.
Primarily known for his long-standing friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell composed the soundtrack for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the British gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack and the film "Carol" by Todd Haynes.
"The things with elongated tones or obtuses seem very interesting to me," says Bateman, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
Sail through those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant public from one to the next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and as an actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished introducing his film to the world premiere for Monday, "Good, bad, he came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival looks like Oscars about the story of the Boston Globe investigation of pedophiles priests
Did you win $240,000 at the lottery?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15th.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 more winning tickets have been recorded throughout Australia, which have shared the unique prize fund estimated by the $4 million X-Lotto.
SA Lotteries asks everyone who bought tickets to X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers since the X-Lotto extraction 3555 of Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager of Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he looks forward to getting the good news that the winner of the big prize checked his ticket at X-Lotto.
"We have tried hard to spread the news, because one person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Detectives from the forensics are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the missing man Daniel Hind was last seen
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his life the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us believe he's alive somewhere, and the other half I think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and put an end to the stories.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17 000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina highways, all of which form part of the pan-European transport corridor, are among the priorities of the approved road infrastructure development plan Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure enhanced road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for trafficking in cultural goods from Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation had been restored to suit the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for Combating Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and selling illegal Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third place, after Italy and Greece, on top of the traffic of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Interior Minister has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria are a phenomenon that has become widespread, being described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the conference on Wednesday acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop illegal trafficking in cultural goods from the war-stricken country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rockedyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal shares for the launch of rockets of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the auction amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to defeat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine at Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts it.
Work on new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of American military or espionage satellites after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 missile of the ULA, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that develops the ULA and costs approximately $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a new engine and a completely new rocket, as ULA is currently planning.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet planned to start testing engines on a large scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in expected contracts at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which starts in October.
She further claims that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a financing of approximately 160 million USD among rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private engine financing options, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The brewing company AB InBev plans a merger worth $275 billion with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer-producing company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) on a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the world's total amount of beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' domination in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing fast-growing markets and their Asian beer factories.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland of the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer-producing companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the second-world company and the producer of more than 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday it was informed by AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing marketing costs, orchestrated prior to the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's going to do because they didn't get any offers.
"At this point, we are in the process of waiting and deciding," said the source.
Speculations of a merger, which would very likely raise concerns about the violation of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for several years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions made by AB InBev, follows a reduction of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller from August onwards.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," said analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, maybe even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would make it the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980.
The SAB shares came close to £19.9% at £36.14, giving it a foreign exchange capitalization of $90 billion.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could search for another merger as defence strategies, as happened in the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottle bottle bottle with the Coca-Cola (KO.N) and in recent weeks there has been suspicion of a combination with Diageo or Australian beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall market share of AB InBev, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to industry experts Plato Logic.
AB InBev intends to report net debt to gross profit (EBITDA) twice from 2.5 of the present.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the most realistic date at which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would be able to borrow to finance an acquisition.
When he bought Budweiser's manufacturing company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. he let the report grow more than 5 times.
An equally big climb would allow him to collect a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev own a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders at SABMiller are the producer of Altera (MO.N) cigarettes and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altera refused to give statements about AB InBev's approach, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that regularly evaluates investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interests of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, Head of European Investments Fair, at Allianz Global Investors, who holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues reaches some 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years," said Dwane.
In the case of any combination, there are significant costs related to the infringement of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made in distribution operations are large, and the stakes related to the violation of competition rules are even higher," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the holding company held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last bid for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment if the company is interested in an auction, but Molson’s shares increased by over 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger may also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the SABMiller’s SABMiller’s CR Snow share association with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have a 28% share of the global market after the drop.
AB InBev is counseled by Lazard, and SABMiller is counseled by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuses a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would later have donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
Suspect Syed Sheaba Ahmed was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in an attack in May on a bus with members of the Muslim minority based in Islam, after which 45 people died, said to journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for Combating Terrorism of the Province.
He will be charged with terrorist financing, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has already funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still doing research to see if he has provided financial aid through his business or behind him is someone else," said the officer.
"In addition, Ahmed has also provided financial aid for AQIS," he said, referring to the organization Al Qaeda on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, who face activism, corruption and murder.
After the Taliban in December massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to suppress activism.
Hard attacks have taken place, while the army has also moved more into tribal regions outside the law border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have supporters from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces prepared and insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in Sargodha and left the Pakistan Air Force in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
It subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York Rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO music group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published Tuesday by the federal court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' judgment weakens the process of infringement of the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet of Los Angeles, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous song in 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
The hip hop star said that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin' song".
He also sued Kia Motors for using the "Party Rock Anthem" song in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the slogan shufflin'.
In Tuesday's judgment, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a song, is protected by the copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared him to other famous lyrics in music from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying that it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared to be impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential survey of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary Republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into seven-point polls.
After Trump's 27% support in the most recent CBS/New York Times survey, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches the second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, TV star Mike Huckabee, senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6 percent.
The support of Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, in numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one leading the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% compared to 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in voters' preferences without university degree (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined which candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who they're going to vote for twice as much Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential Republican debate.
Carson's ascension to this poll reflects that of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for nominating the Democrats to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up to CBS's presidential nominations shows that Sanders rose by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively, in New Hampshire, among the democratic voters for preliminarys.
A leading ethics expert says that sex robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sexual robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models they are inspired by – the way they will show, what roles they will have – are very disturbing,” she said for the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to an increase in sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are now manufacturing are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we need to stop it from the front.
Surely, the industry seems to be gaining momentum.
A few years ago, the inflatable doll-producing company True Companion launched Roxxxy, the "first sex robot in the world".
However, concern about the possible high dangers of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of the industry.
Just this spring, Tesla Motors’ executive director, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that something really dangerous will happen in five years.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Britain welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the following days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced Interior Minister Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extended programme of re-installation of the government.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camp on the border with the country torn by war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government is "working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that they are already fully equipped with the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to learn more about the number of persons and the date on which they are estimated to be arriving.
May noted that the government must make further plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of enlargement requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington and I will continue to keep the camera on track.
But I am pleased to tell the House that we are waiting to welcome the first wave of refugees in the next few days and work quickly on planning several arrivals in the weeks to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew his anger to the MPs and militants when he unveiled the plan for government refugees, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron stated in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom “will rise to its high moral responsibility” and will receive 20,000 refugees from Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal Democratic MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "distances".
Also, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and figures have also condemned measures.
In a joint letter, big names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is referring to the fund of global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian rouble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for one dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble was due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by China's weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent rates increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching USD 48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.

"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by uncertainty in China and the time of the rise in the federal interest rate, which will continue to pay the ton for oil and rouble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys of Rabobank, expert in strategy for monetary policies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy ruble.
The global markets await the decision of the Federal Reserve on Thursday with the heart of the mouth, whether or not it will increase the interest rate.
The markets believe that what could be the first increase in the US interest rate in nine years will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
The collaboration comes as a result of a widespread concern about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high-density urban areas such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," says the research.
Without a common set of technology protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, a Baroness from the House of Lords, concern has grown on the background of reports on events at the limit of an accident and operation of drones above football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"Over the past two years, more than 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been related to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: the construction of a system to track all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As more and more small drones carry out commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even completely autonomous flights, some air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of parcels to cities," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, road planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules set for road traffic, such as signalling and belts.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union in the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative SME companies in the UK that use this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and the media," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike Button: Why Facebook Wants to Know What Hurts You
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the many users inside Facebook's virtual borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - approximately $240 billion after the last statistic - is due to the amount of unimaginable data about consumers it holds.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable image of complexity, located in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable primarily for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully which people to see ads on Facebook, by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “appreciate” a national football team, charitable organizations and promoters want to address those who, for example, “empathize” with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see on News.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast universe of content that you could see, in the smallest stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and especially on what you liked.
Undoubtedly, there is fear on Facebook that many interesting, but unhappy posts do not enter the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate them.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could make the decision to eliminate this kind of news posts.
Facebook has carried out in the past experiments to understand how what you see on News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Representatives of the academic environment call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt of Facebook (and published openly, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust the algorithms to distribute several elements.
What will happen with the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The truly exciting thing is how the decision of one company to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason why this is happening may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our lives in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and one that carries on a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions he makes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones considered most appropriate to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll also have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that the body's signals can anticipate these, sometimes violent, changes before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say his head hurts or "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is transmitting to us, and we need to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data from the bracelets can be collected over time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magical. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at Wirral Austistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology in Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring in their life assistive technology. Now, apps for iPad give, on their own, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic children learn to play by hiding.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organization for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria “in the following weeks”
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air strikes on targets Isis in Syria, announced the government only a few days after President François Hollande declared the intervention "necessary".
France will conduct the first air raids on the jihadist Islamic State group in Syria "in the following weeks," Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday.
The French air forces are carrying out reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow “in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for the French Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the town of the Great there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what is left of it," he said.
France is part of a coalition led by the United States, which has bombed Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Hollande changed the strategy last week to expand its actions in Syria, under conditions of political pressure it accumulates on the basis of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
The blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make your phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the mobile version of the Safari browser from Apple.
At the test, it was found that after blocking ads, news sites such as New York Times are loading twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Blocking ads also helps users to maintain the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several ad lock options, including 1Locker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop ad locking tool, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator plans to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software to block commercials meet a few constraints.
Ads are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their usage on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for the online media, which is mostly offered free to consumers and has been financially supported for many years by advertising.
A report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers almost 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
In order to enable blocking of ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for locking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which is already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in recent months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of Catalonia's Spanish territory voting in the elections that will take place this month.
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we have committed ourselves firmly to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
“We welcome you with open arms,” Felipe replied.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a talk at the tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States of America since the rise to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were about to make a visit to South Florida.

"Spectre" will be broadcast in cinemas in the United States in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen on Monday having dinner together, stirring up the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley cheerful and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken jeans, coats and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who broke up with and with whom she was constantly reconciled, actress Meg Ryan.
Melencamp praised the message star for you at NBC's Today show, saying he was "an angel who was sent to me and I'm very happy."
He added that "nothing is over until it's over".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen's magazine, trampling on her mother's tracks.
The kings of Arctic mosquitoes are big enough to take down a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proven a benefit to others.
One of these advantageous species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the mosquitoes here to appear earlier and grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for the Dartmouth International Understanding, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under a 2-degree increase in temperature.
They are small, but they are important members of the Arctic trophic chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Processings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists anticipate better how a growing population of mosquitoes could affect the karibu they feed with, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with laboratory experiments that investigated how the temperature influences the development of the insect and the readiness to be hunted by predators.
While increasing temperature makes bigger mosquitoes more vulnerable to colleopters, it also gives them an early start in the spring and makes their larvae develop faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
Several mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can develop but only to the extent that insect feed can support it.
The ability of the mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the use of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neural or behavioral development.
Studies have shown that selective inhibitors of serotonin recovery (SSRI) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even higher risk for women and their children, which is why it should be treated.
"These studies add to an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressant administration during pregnancy," said a press release John Thorp, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51,404 children in the Norwegian cohort study of the mother and child, researching the effects of SSRI use on the development of motor skills at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy and 159 of them had been treated with drugs for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not so significant as to give delay clinical importance”.
A group of researchers from Adelaide University in Australia conducted an examination of the data for 49 000 women in Danish national birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children's behaviour up to 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to post-birth bleeding if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that, although the study linked the administration of increased risk SSRIs, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information provided by researchers about women's specific medical conditions - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"Women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy may have been the ones with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Only on the basis of this study do we not recommend that women stop treating medicines against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding as much as possible.
Matthew is charged with murder in case of the murder of the student from Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham student from Virginia University was charged with qualifying murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University missing in 2009, announced Tuesday authorities.
The grand jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum life imprisonment penalty.
Harrington, 20-year-old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we've been working hard and unabashed for this," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the domino pieces of the consequences began to be laid down.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham cases and a 2005 Fairfax County sexual abuse.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for the latter and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with the death of a student at Virginia University
Harrington had gone to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, together with his friends at a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of the John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't come back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with Panthera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's purse and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
Family and friends started an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of educational studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a line of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, on a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period overlaps with the time Harrington disappeared.
Police say that a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said that these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not currently publicize the details of the new evidence that led Matthew to be charged with the murder of Harrington.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to give statements.
The announcement of the indictment comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center, near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for the qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the early days of Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and views organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says she endured for her daughter speculations and media critics who must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"During this time there have also been discussions like "Why was he wearing a short skirt?" and "And looking for it with the candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we are dealing with a predator on the tail of the hunt," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that one September evening, as she was walking home from the store, a stranger came after her.
He took her to a green area, beat her up and held her by the neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end had come to me, that I had to scream incessantly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly took her away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been scared by the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will be served in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today I've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.
Is Jon Snow dead or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue to the fate of the character or the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of the contract or HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked in a few more seasons, he said he couldn't talk about it.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for some time, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then will be the moment when I bury myself in film-length projects," said the actor.
The series comes back on small screens in the spring of next year.
The Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of season four, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched several theories, according to which he will be brought back to life somehow.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "Jon Snow's Pomana", 40 days after the end of the season, which took over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the programmes "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media", both interrupted early April 2015.
According to a communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this decision, approximately EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the immediate period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the chief of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" in Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desir, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "maintains a common European immigration strategy", while insisting that national borders need to be protected.
Romania wants to hit the World rugby
Romania's rugby national is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup that will begin Friday in Britain.
"Stejari" proposed to win two wins in Group D.
"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," Mihai Macovei, the captain of Romania, said.

Refugee Crisis: JHA without any solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that on Thursday he will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union Summit on Migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian or counterpart Werner Faymann called for a European Union summit on Tuesday to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed his support for the recent Berlin decision to impose border controls on the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure is intended to facilitate the registration of refugees.
In turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of binding quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal for the urgent redistribution of 120,000 refugees between the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency relocation mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provokes controversy, after the publication of cartoons that mock the answer of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries affected by the war.
In the most recent number, the publication has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, says the agency Reuters.
One of the drawings embroidered a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy, whose body reached one of the beaches of Turkey, after a successful attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's design shows a child in short pants and shirt, with face down on the grand stage, next to a billboard that offers two children's menus at the price of one.
"So close to succeeding," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "The Evidence that Europe Is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who walks on the water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up into the water, first saying "Christians go on the water", takes the second "Muslim kids drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats after the jeering of the Prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically amended in Russia
The French chain of Auchan supermarkets has been amended by over $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total over 25 million rubles, that is, $372,000, relates the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
The reasons for these fines were not specified, and Auchan made no comment.
The French supermarket chain is also the target of the Russian agricultural agency's accusations, which claim that some meat products have been detected as infested with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the issue of extending the sanctions of the European Union and the decision of France to annul an agreement on the provision of Mistral Russian ships.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefly informed of this decision and that it is not a political right gesture.
MAE shows, in a communication to Diare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
As a result, MAE informed Romania’s competent decision-making factors in relation to this situation in a timely and urgent manner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and who are strategic partners is not a fair political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it shows up in the communiqué.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary for the smugglers of people who are passing Serbia to change their routes, with the probability of moving towards Romania," the chief of the Hungarian diplomacy explained.
"The garden would start from the border point of Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moves to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants transiting Serbian territory on their way to the European Union attempted to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can walk away the fence through the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhasa (Hungary).
The government of Hungary has allocated 22.2 billion forks (71.8 million euros) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometers, and for special centres needed for immigrant homes.
The fence initiative is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The uninspired body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Romanian Senate, despite the desire in this sense expressed by the widow of the politician.
According to a statement submitted by Diare.com, the Permanent Senate Bureau discussed, Tuesday, a request by Mrs. Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the uninscrupulous body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter to the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninscrupulous body has already been deposited at a lacs of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciates that there is no need to be moved from there to the Romanian Senate," the Senate transmits.
Senator PNL Teodor Athanasius argued that this request "is not in accordance with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
It also sends Agerpres, the senators held a moment of recollection in memory of the former PRM leader, at the proposal of Senator UNPR Serb Michaelescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died on Monday night around 18:30.
The President of the PRM passed into the infirmary at the Army's Emergency Clinic.
The Eurorelament will be buried Thursday, from 12:00, at the Ghencea cemetery, and will have military honors.
Refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of the border localities, questions about accommodation places
Mayors in the border localities of Arad County are questioned by Police and Border Police, these days, about places of accommodation for any refugees that may arrive in Romania, but also for the gendarms, if they will be mobilized at the border.
The building of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this theme.
Discussions were also conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked the farmers, who have work at this time on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the editor said.
The immigration crisis in Hungary: Shields and water cannons at the border
He, like other mayors in the Hungarian border area, said that the police asked for information on the available accommodation places in the case of a refugee wave.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have refugee spaces in our village.
We believe that such special centres do not have to defend at the border, because they are harder to control here, migrants being tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in more remote areas of the border," said the mayor of the municipality of Iratosu, Papp Atila Joseph.
In his turn, Mayor of Doobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said he was asked about both places of accommodation for refugees and intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt and gendarmes.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"We've been asked about the length of the Hungarian border, probably working on an action plan," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, permanent establishment".
"There's always a police officer at the station, and the locals know they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," said the editor.
The Pilu Mayorial representatives said that at least a hundred people can be hunted on the Cultural Path, the information being offered to the police at their request.
Also, Mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, said there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but here are necessary accommodations.
A former Border Police barracks could also be arranged to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not offer a view on the questioning of mayors during this period, confirming that "in the border localities of Arad County, patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander Announces Radical Measures Against Becali's Star
Army Sports Club Commander, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although both sides have negotiated a package, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palmares of the "ros-blues".
The team that won the Champions Cup is in pause for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process by which he requests damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period to which we refer through the determination of ICCJ is very clear.
We have to recover the damage from the FC Star, the team that used the Star brand without the acceptance of the propeller - that is CSA Stara.
It appears very clear and the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumes it has so far in palm trees," says George Boroi.
The star of Becali and the Army Club have been in open war since the end of last year, when the supreme court has decided that the military are the ones holding the "Stea" mark.

The region where millions of people are "pocketing"
Millions in Asia-Pacific will form this year the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the assets accumulated in China and India, shows a study published Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated wealth of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the wealth of the millionaires in North America, which currently represents the richest people in the world, with a combined fortune of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study specifies that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, HNWI's wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets coming from emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," is shown in the study carried out by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India represent almost 10% of HNWI's global wealth and is responsible for 17% of the global increase in new assets after 2006.
China, the second economy of the world after the United States, had in 2014 an 890,000 millionaires with a combined fortune of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5%, and 19.3%, respectively, compared to 2013.

"Dorel" mounted the light inverse
In Suceava, the workers set up a light above the ground, so instead of being aware that they have to wait 4 seconds, the passers-by get the message "h", which I can't figure out.
It's not bad, everyone else goes red, informs the truth.
Each one passes the way he cuts his head.
Two boys were gonna be picked up by a car because they went red.
"Policies from Routera should be here, helping, until the world is used," said a woman for the quoted source.
The light was recently mounted in front of the Great Stone in the center of Sucevea, but the passers-by doesn't seem to care about it at all, with as much as the information received seems inconceivable.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job right and he found himself responsible enough to give his ok for the completion of the work, then he wouldn't have ended up in this absurd situation.
The head of the Road Administration and Route Systemization Service in Suceava Town Hall recognizes that it was from the front when the traffic lights started to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"I was actually the girl when they were put into operation," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem will be fixed in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be fixed, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Russian pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under Dunare, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, however, was not to be found, as even the minister of the economy, Mihai Totuse, supported.
Police put water cannons on immigrants
At the main border of Hungary with Serbia, Hungarian Granices used water and tear gas cannons against immigrants on Wednesday.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the Serbian-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water tunnels were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the barbed wire fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
The Hungarian police claim that cannons were a control measure of the crowd, which was throwing bottles of water.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people cry after the use of tear gas.
At the same time, Elena Enikos writes that two German companies refused to deliver Hungarian juniper sarma.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and the border with Romania, a strongly criticized initiative in Bucharest.
German companies claim that barbed wire is very dangerous and provoke cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military facilities, but should not be used against people seeking shelter, support companies.
In parallel with the confrontations at the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to put at the disposal of bus immigrants in order to transport those present at the country border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children also showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, on the drama of Greece - why agree with the third agreement with the EU
The stated purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the Syriza leader made part of a third loan agreement for this country in Greece, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to re-entrust his prime minister's mandate in elections that he claims will strengthen his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not to leave the euro area or break up the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," former Prime Minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Elen Government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "certainly needs reforms", specifying that it needs to start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, the period when a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.
He picked himself with his neck broken and degree one burns after he blew up in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered one-degree burns, fractures in the neck and a finger and a hole like a coin in the mouth sky, after an electronic cigarette that he smoked exploded in the face.
James Lauria had a short break to smoke at the job, when the incident occurred after her stay for a week in intensive therapy, says The Daily Mail.
Laurie, who was connected to a breathing machine, suffered and burned at her hands and horns and a tooth in her face got into her gum.
I was at work and things were quiet and I went out for a second, as I always did.
"On denial, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," Laurie told me.
Six weeks after the accident, Laurie still can't swallow solid food and follow a liquid diet as she recovers at her parents' home.
The electronic cigarette that caused man's injuries is in the custody of the authorities, which conducts an investigation of the incident.

Star Trek's actress, in jail for undressing in front of children
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, stepping on Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to jail, where she was from 3 September - the bail was fixed at 2,500 dollars - took place in front of her home in Tennessee.
The sight began to quarrel with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his children crying, informs Mirror.
At some point, during the argument, the actress lifted her shirt, showing her bust, so then, before entering the house, to take off her pants and pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forcibly driven to the car.
It's not the first time the 41-year-old actress has trouble with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then making herself guilty even of the attack.
Jennifer went into Kes's leather since 1995, after she appeared in "American History X", a film in which she also played Edward Norton.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She is married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're being taken into sight with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and of "vising" immigrants.
"The West cries for them and the West supports terrorism from the beginning of the crisis, when it said that this is a peaceful revolt," Assad said in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his western counterparts say of the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, they don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the entire refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the accusations against the Western States and in what regard to their treatment of refugees.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes them in sight with the second eye machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and murders and, secondly, because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and the destruction of the infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so that many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president, adding as political forces, either inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I want to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because this is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through political dialogue and action," Bashar al Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West once again of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppressed Russia's opposition and came to power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that it was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader in Damascus pointed out.
Not lastly, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, the President of Syria accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "Indeed, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide a cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, you'll notice - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, considering it's a real and not false coalition, who fought against terrorism," the leader in Damascus said.
Autumn?
Not at all.

Map of the country with the highest rates and how Romania lives
The collapse of the oil quota has caused great losses in the last year to workers in the extract of the title, the shareholders of the energy companies and the countries that depend very much on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has become hugely cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries considered, the price of fuel has fallen.
The most important price reduction in the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, changes in taxation, but also fluctuations in the currency rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg has turned the average price from every state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data shows that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
So, we were ranked 27th in the country with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this top position.
The last quarter girl in 2014, gasoline also got cheap in the Romans.
Then the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.
However, the surrounding countries are still better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Nemti set up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 lands of the federation in receiving and distributing the tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers from the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"These pivot points are needed," she pointed out.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
First of all, they called for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed upon by the federal government coalition more than a week ago.
Thuringia Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for the amount "the least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In his turn, the first of the Rhine-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy in the manipulation of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and Holland in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Land Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria is carrying the most heavy burden, with the most migrants arriving after the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual door policy open at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scandalizes after the humiliating defeat of Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the Real Madrid match, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach was totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because he was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I wish to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
They're two totally different ways.
We were given a yellow card right away, while the top teams didn't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any way!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
A game as well as a level should not be influenced by arbitration.
"I'm sorry that the arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here?"
They were pieces of cut-off husband
A murder of a sadism out of the community terrified the inhabitants of Targu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, markets in Targu Frumos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
Along with the three tortoises, the criminals "sembled" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
He was cut off, but his head, internal organs and genitals were missing.
In the end, it had to prove that it was the body of an ex-officer, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
"The Day of Iasi" was talking about even with the taxi driver who helped the murderer, without knowing, to the carrying of bags with the broken body.
His stories make you hairy.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman with three bags that were horrifying, after pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from Targu Beautiful.
As in American films, the man himself helped to transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but not knowing, the killer being a customer for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for the "Iași Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his handbags the pieces of body of the professor's husband of geography, which he had cut off.
She had come to Targu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe he's got lambs.
I didn't know.
Nea Mihai, as is known by her friends who practice taximetry in Targu Frumos, has become star over the night in the small town in which she lives.
He saw American films throughout his life, but he never thought he would ever be the one who would lay the foundation for the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he would see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells us that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually awaits the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and the Pacific.
The taxi driver tells us that the killer woman observed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the bags with the pieces of body supported by the indicator showing the nearby localities.
She came at night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters from the pedestrian crossing from the Pascani, right at the station where it displays the kilometer.
The bags were drawn from the signboard with the indicator.
After she left the bus, I gave her to the marshal ten meters, to her.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here?"
I saw that she's an elderly woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to dispossession, maybe he's got lambs, I didn't have to know.
I've been thinking maybe he wanted to bite someone with that stinking flesh.
She was trying to lift a bag by herself, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified to take her to the big market gate, when I took her from the bus," Mihai began to tell.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman didn't say anything at all, and therefore neither was he curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't talk at all, because I was nervous that he put my hoit in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I took two meters back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car over and over, to disappear the smell.
At the bus I didn't notice if someone was helped down the bags because we had lights in the back and we didn't see right in the mirrors.
"It was two plastic bags and one scratch," the man added.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says he began to touch her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she took her bags off, I went to the hospital, to the City Hall, and when I came back, I looked especially at what the woman with the luggage is doing.
She had in the meantime brought the luggage to the fence, where there are also the dumpsters inside the market.
Then I left again.
There was little agitation because a bus arrived from Italy and a bus.
I've seen how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very nervous, she walked over and over.
At some point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen her a while ago.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them there was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcesti," added Mihai.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after leaving the luggage at the dumpsters.
At me, the suspicion left from the fact that the luggage was missing, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I warned her she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the graveyards and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3 o'clock, when I gave statements to the police and the local prosecutors," the cab driver's report concluded.
The German prosecutors, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras of a gas station in Roman at 0.55, climbing with the three bags on the bus.
She arrived at Targu Fremos at 1.30.
According to investigators, she would have killed the husband, who had been married for four years, with a knife, then cut him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zacharia, and he was a reserve officer.
Sunday night, the woman put the pieces of body in two plastic bags, which she transported to the bus station, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iași.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the husband's internal organs and genitals hid.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a bar in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, as was her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason he killed his husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be a psychic expert, and the body will be examined by forensic doctors, to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The city took the national roads from the city after they had been taken by the Government years ago, in order to be able to be asphalted with money from the national budget in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be able to be implemented, a decision must be taken by the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condition for this to give the opinion for the General Banystic Ur Plan (PUG).
The city hall has taken over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that cross the city.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, government decisions will have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national highways that freeze the city are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Road 28 is beating the Iash on the arteries: the road Păcurari, rue Munteni (to be mafor), Moara de Foc, Straupungere Silvestru, rue Silvestru, Bd. Nicolae Iorga, Bd. Primaverii, Routea Chisinăului, the road Teuțăra until the exit of the municipality to Tomesti - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the road Bucium, Bd. Socola (up to traffic light), Bucium street (up to Base 3), Chisinau Road, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and exiting towards Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of the "file" of Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathies, which, however condensed, would be presented beyond the size of a daily article and must be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the actual debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", would have to spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing critical the various versions that spoke of the recording of Eliade in the Legion through the "Axe" and Radu Gyr, Florin Vourcanu brings to the discussion, in the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistolar contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "the balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a tracking note from 1938, Florin Quurcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legionary family" called Lumința, a group of "cuiburi" of intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
Since there is no verifiable data on the nest of the Light, those in exile considering the existence of this debatable "legionary family", what must be discussed is, after the context in which this information was recorded on the file.
Leaving it to a surprising part of the SRI's kindness to make these secret files available to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the pursuit of security was "commandant" Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade making himself, as noted on 21 March 1938, in the context that Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs had received free hand to take all necessary measures so that King Carol could impose his royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionaries who were beginning to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the country was the third party in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was carried out following this note, quoted by Kurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legion Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the 1938 repression and it is likely that such superficial notes were made on retaliation for the great majority of legionaries or supporters active in the public space who were to be arrested but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement mentioned above, given in the arrest, in February 1941, after the collapse of the legionate rebellion, only makes it retrospectively confirm the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police, authoritarian regime.
It would have been interesting if Kurcanu had offered more details about the contents of the listed directory.
Was it Eliade's file or Radu Gyr's?
Because it has to be a file built on the basis of safety documents anyway, but then processed by Security to be used either against or against each other.
It is here a misunderstanding, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only one who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he represents a pre-emptive stage, of proof, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, in the three-year trial period before becoming "camera" with acts all right.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or scenes, seizers, talking groups with peasants, youth organisations or students gravitated around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unaided reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which may be plausible) to be understood and used ad literam to designate political registration in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtle interpretations of this kind cannot conceal the public activity of the Guard's support and the clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether in the seat of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political reform itself said all the more so as, as a rule, intellectuals of this size retain a type of superiority in the face of the activists as such and only enters into politics when they are offered directly high privileges.
As long as I could form an opinion on Eliade's type of thinking at that time, when he was "the leader of the young generation," I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigour of a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention, except in the past, the fact that, in any legionary "file", what it receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Eliade, up to new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, a defender of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Úrcanu's claims (based however on some archival documents, even if it would have been well-deserved and contextualized more seriously) with an argument however debatable.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the volume of New glosses on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006), that "not a single line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any hints of this frame".
There was no way that in 1968, when he came out of some kind of live communist occams, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to highlight is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was respectful, admired and affection without any doubt about Eliade's ascendance.
There really is no even the palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would have been Eliade's boss.
Intelligently, the poet forced to write to the Glasul of the Land, dedicates himself to the place of the embarrassing condition by signaling to Elijah (who knew exactly what mission he had that publication that was constantly dealing with denigration of the right exile), in signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visible relieved and happy when he responds affectionately after nearly three decades of separation since the "violent time" estranged him.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been charged (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back quietly at least to see his mother and friends) and that, knowingly, he carries out dry and by short sentences, broken down by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows only interest in literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, refined political complicities suggested or any mention of the youth years in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legionary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Úrcanu, we have in this memory correspondents who confess a mutual appreciation of characters who have marked different, but stately, our culture and who, beyond the severe trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, role models for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the destiny "under the time" of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the health problems and catastrophic floods in the country, announced the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he had a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passports for his sister), that he could not pass the invitation to return to the country.
The next was predictable: it is put back on the index, mounted in Israel "Toladot's business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments d'un newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never seeing their mother again.
Among friends in the country only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence though, surprisingly, as a personal archive of Chicago attests, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr never received permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Elijah's second conviction operation (through official invitations, the steps of Noica, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicillina Iași tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The exits take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of Division A1 of female volleyball, Penicilina Iași kept her place in the first stage due to the withdrawal and then the disbanding of the Science of Miroslava, fresh promoted in the first stage following a parade tour disputed even in the village of Escia.
The news took little on the unprepared leadership of the exit group, which woke up without the principal coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, reached second to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studineanu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdila (the champion of Alba Blaj) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Faca.
Of course, until the scheduled 10 October championship was started, there was also time for the batch to be completed.
First a new coach was found in the person of Dan Gavril, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has been working on Penicilina in the last few years, it is humbling to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then two players were brought from the Science Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconită, and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to the transfer being the Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline group led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at the Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tour held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from September 23-25, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have an experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and that is why we will also call on volleyballists from abroad, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sportsmen from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year 5-6, even if it would be very hard," said ACS President Penicillina Iași, Vasile Left.
Exciting meeting.
Twins reunited after almost 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish mother had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers were so separated not only by the one who gave them life, but also by the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any trace that would lead him to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the program, Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters have surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iași brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze were won by children from the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Federation of Sport Dance and the World Federation of Sport Dance.
From Iași participated five teams training at the Dance Energy Club and dancing with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children from the country participated in five different categories (youth and amateur youth 1, youth 2, junior 2).
Those who returned home with the medals were pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other couples managed to occupy front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujba and not lastly Andrea Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionita.
As a coach, I wanted to reconfirm the results achieved in March this year, and this reconfirmation is necessary both for us and for sportsmen as well as for their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals, we enjoy enormous joys and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All these would only be possible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," Andreea Ramona Manolache, the coach of the kids at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country for 4 out of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 ways to get rid of stress in one minute
Too few of us are allowed to run a weekend to the mountains to get rid of stress.
Some keep our time, others - the finances, and others both obstacles.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to get rid of a little bit of stress.
These do not involve high costs and special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we face them and how we deal with them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep breath
Breath exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any man in part, and adjusting breathing in a tense moment helps release endorphins in the body, a process that leads to a state of relaxation, Livestrong informs.
Be a child
We know we've passed the age of childhood and we're no longer allowed to join when we're in a mood.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office headquarters or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not scream how much we have our lungs.
You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with a few shrieks.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of a replica of a psychotherapy session, but it's not just for psychologists to use it often.
Imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detachment of daily frenzy, can lead to the attenuation of nerves.
It is really self-sustainment, which can even change lives, both for good and for bad.
Everything depends on what we're self-sustaining.
The best thing is to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Drain your castles into your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might experience weights in relaxing.
Listen even to relaxation songs, which are lined and do not contain lyrics, to restore balance as soon as your fitil is lit.
Decojiti or orange
Does it sound strange to counsel you to uncook an orange on your nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasionally, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during peeling, stimulates its brain to produce endorphins, good-state hormone.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's the one at home, or the one who's sitting next to the job, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal handling may reduce blood pressure.
time and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, singing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining guitar violin.
The acoustic project belongs to Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe musicians and is titled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentine: "We found each other, and from that moment we were very happy to sing together, with an virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the time a violin met with a guitar.
Christi: "From the first date we realized that what we are singing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us learned from the other's repertoire, and what's very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a crash between classical music people and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, I was stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rocks and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music and rock, and those who listen only rock to get to like it and classical music.
And I had his surprise to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
Students from Iași have been in more traffic than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday morning in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The city hall announced that today the Mangeron boulevard (Bahlui left side) is closing between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The chiefs of the City Hall failed to keep their promises of carrying out work on smoothing traffic with the start of the school year.
One of the insurances that the municipality has provided, at least twice in the past few weeks, has seen in the re-establishment of the international war zone.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be assembled, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, the rotation was not realized yesterday.
The drivers' nerves were extended to no more than Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the City Hall was violated: the move of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the latest until the end of August", in the context that this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says that the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be done at the right time, we need to take account of the movement of trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on the tour, but we'll sort it out somehow," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to it, would be to stop the tram with a light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of Podu Roș.
The line of cars on St. Lazarus Street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited for good minutes to be able to get out in the Red Bridge," said a quitter.
By Podu Roș in September they were to circulate streetcars to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "Development and functional rehabilitation south" was completed in the original execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"I drew European funds for new works, for example overhaul, on the initial variant of the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica said.
The latest deadline for the reintroduction of trams is October.
During the day yesterday, exits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Easter, Central (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The queen could come back as head of the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Tribunal will decide tomorrow whether the President of the Judicial Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iași Tribunal resolved yesterday a new deadline in the "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to take a decision during the day tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Crown.
The latter wishes to house or revoke this measure, which keeps it away from the head of the JC for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained also by the superior court, Cristiana Amonita will be able to resume its role as President of the JC.
The Ampina was sued by the National Directorate of Anticoruption (DNA), being accused of favouring the creator and false intellectuals after, I say, trying to mask an audit control after which a number of irregularities were discovered regarding the receipt of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The governess would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more materials to promote Iași county, although scriptically these figures were received by the JC.
He was also referred to the court and three directors of the JC, but also to the manager of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote by 25 September
The City Hall is prepared to distribute further questions, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replantation of the curtains on the pedestrian Stephen the Great.
According to municipal officials, about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed to neighborhood centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good and Town Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of exits appeared on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iashu loves the tea", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast every minute.
On the other hand, over the course of the month, some 440 exits have come to the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits call for signaling and the public's lack of efficiency in public consultation.
Therefore, they made an appeal to Internet users yesterday to print a group information poster and stick it on the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that the last forms were supplemented by Sunday exits at the additional point in Copou Park.
We'll provide forms from the neighborhood centers, where it's not very complete.
"Perhaps additionals will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," the municipality's spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.
If the majority vote on the exits is in favour of replanting the trees, then the City Hall will plant your silver in this fall.
The exits can express their views at the neighborhood centres of Dacia, Beautifula, Tâtarași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The chiefs of the City Hall decided to cut Stephen the Great in early 2013, an action that attracted a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iashu loves you", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of tees was signed, until last night, by over 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students enrolled at USAMV Iași!
I'm 920 in year I
The University has 920 students this year in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" stated that this year were the most candidates ever admitted, from the history of the higher education institution, from the establishment.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of eligible candidates in the history of the university, almost 920 students in the year I. Never exceeded that number.
"We also had candidates with higher averages, we occupied the posts from budget to license and master," said Prof. Ioan Tenu, the pro-rector responsible for didactic activity.
It further indicated that the university also registered a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results were also published on the Romanian-language study lines, the further admission to the English-language study programme at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which brought 50 seats to the competition, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry on the confirmation of the student files and the necessary study visas.
At the fall session a total of 120 files were filed on the 14 budgeted places and 209 were presented to the "tax" competition at the license studies.
Most files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, number 75, at Horticulture were 23, and at Zootechnie, 22.
At the Master's meeting, 18 files were filed, on the 150 duty stations proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootechnie.
Drivers are afraid to get in with the wheels of the cars in the cracks on the bridge Tudor Vladimirescu
The bridge over the Bahlu on the Tudor Vladimirescu boulevard was as clumsy as when the "Jiaul de Iasi" wrote about the problems they presented, 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then pointed out that on the axis delimiting the two meanings of walking the asphalt was left, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge were seen.
Also, asphalt began to crack on one side and the other of the axis, pre-dentating signs that the depths will be accentuated.
At that time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to launching a five million euro bridge and tram rehabilitation project.
The Mayor of Chirica specified that the area affected by fissures and pits would be signalized, and the asphalt restoration work would be carried out quickly.
The only steps taken so far, however, have been the setting up of pops and a signaling tape, without even making a single lead.
During this period, we have focused more on opening up the school and the necessary work for this purpose.
"There is a point-of-point expertise for the bridge that we are waiting for in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'll enjoy it or let myself be swept away by melancholy; leaning, passively, towards the second variant.
First, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I first took him with emotion to the garden.
Although she reverberates, no normal parent is happy to raise her children.
Second, because I remember the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, the top, didn't end until today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But the school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend, even as a teacher.
When I decided this was what I wanted to do my whole life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like each of us, I've given up all kinds of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or right-handedly imbecile.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this breach.
I think they're toxic, because they damage enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, as long as I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptional ones.
These meetings can be decisive if they take place at the right time.
Whoever thinks that the role of the chair is trivial transmission of information is bitter.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, the student can be very well informed by himself, that we are only living in the time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, models the mind of students.
He's training them, he's paying for their thinking.
Being in the chair is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturious, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to seek hibels from those in front of them.
That dictates their age, their temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought that we knew everything, that we have clear assurances about anything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, they learn to doubt, ask questions.
Let's find out on their own the answers, either them or the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
To discreetly point him to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially since the student most often thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who hardly waits to catch the wrong foot to punish him.
Well, that's right for him, the pure, unintelligent, rebellious, for living his age's calls, for looking at the one at the cathedral with suspicion.
That he just can't accept his natural attempt to order him.
Teenagers do not get up to date, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if they seem to do it, they get revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a rigid person at the cathedral, who imposes himself by harshness and does not communicate, the students get revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a mix of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their mindless.
I always urge my students: if you get from a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him distance you from the literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puberty since then on his understanding.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened my door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with bookcases.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having one too.
Now maybe I have it, but if I hadn't taken my fate in the way, maybe I would have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in luck.
It is essential to give over the man who takes your hand and points you patiently to his own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me just talk about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be taught.
There is no literature teacher, as there is mathematics teacher.
How do you fix the ineffable concept?
You can at best approach him, without pretence that you transmit petrified truths.
The one at the cathedral can at most guide reading, that's completely different.
But most of all, he can have some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the one in the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can raise someone, the balances on his eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must first of all manage to make his students understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great seamstress, Al. Paleologu, said one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why a good lady prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, it repeats only from inertia a great truth: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student a apprentice.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure as many such separations.

If the FIFA investigation extends
Justice in the United States and Switzerland will bring new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new individuals and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced on Monday at a press conference held in Zurich that the area of investigations into global football corruption was enlarged.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will undertake further criminal prosecutions for new individuals and new organizations," Lynch said.
In May, more senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We have hopes that other people who are being prosecuted will get to the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had seized several goods, including homes and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the course of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first season," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
In the interest of investigators, the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil also entered into a contract for the surrender of media rights.
FIFA is faced with a major corruption scandal, after the U.S. justice has charged 14 people, including two FIFA Vice Presidents and seven Forge officials.
Detained persons are researched for taking bribes and receiving other benefits from the early 1990s and so far, totaling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced at the beginning of July that he was resigning from the position of president of FIFA, after being real for the fifth time.
Beats like in movies at the theater
At the Supekombat gala in Milan, the exit Cătalin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătalin Moroșanu will participate on October 2 at the Superkombat Gala from the Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the November Final, is shown in a communication delivered MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star gale.
While we've chosen an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters on the schedule of the event.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanian Cristi Speccu, Cristian Stancu and Amassio Paraschiv.
"The full program will soon be announced," promoter Eduard Irimia said.
Cătalin Moroșanu will fight in the Gale Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with American James Wilson, known after he participated in the last heavy-class pyramid in Japan and numerous prizes from bodybuilding contests in 2012.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the finals, so now I'm gonna get revenge on him.
"From the beast I turned him into a kitten," said Moroshanu.
Undefeated in 2015, the brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have in Italy the last confrontations before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to go back to Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there and promise them a new unforgettable show," Andrei Stoica said world champion.
In Milan he will fight Raul Catinaş with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she also argued in letter
A girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen on her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit her family.
The letter did not go without an echo, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but also apologized that she could not be present on 27 September, but even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before poet Adrian Paunescu died.
Both writers died heartily.
Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor's fate is similar.
Both were writers and politicians, and both were at close ages, of heart.
Adrian Paunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died on a TV reality show.
Full of caution, Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the minister of tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At some point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Paunescu with the smile on his jokes: "I am envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
Peascu, smiling and he, then answered him, "It's not too laudable what you said to me now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two Unknown People after an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident occurred Monday night around 7:00 p.m. in Dumbrava town of Iași county.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
Following the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of the transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on its way to give them medical assistance and transport them to the hospital.
The cops are on the spot.
Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a refugee version of the popular "Super Mario" game, which evokes the plight of his fellow countrymen on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Funerals, the modified video game has in the center on "Mario Refugee".
The character is trying to get past human traffickers and border police on his way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with Mario refugee after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova detention center, the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I.
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Prison Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to less well-known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in class I, and the oldest is 25 and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned about debating right now, we are all stressed by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Center offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said on Monday at the opening of the school year.
The Justice Minister drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have another chance to live if they could have taken any child's natural school course, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what it means to abide by the law and what consequences it may have had.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not to permanently isolate from society people who have broken the law, to shut them behind high walls, but to try to re-edit them and prepare them, so that when they return in the midst of the community they will have more chances of reintegration," added Cazanciuc.
The minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases conditions of detention are at the limit of humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we're not going to be able to change over the night what hasn't happened 25 years, but they're important steps we're making.
"In all these steps we need and support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
Justice Minister hated both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of everyone.
"And because today is the Feast of the Holy Cross, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Marăști and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
The doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be dissolved!
The petition of prestigious university students from Iași and the country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition by the Romanian Academic Society asking the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even disband doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic taxation".
Among the signatories of the petition launched on 10 September are teachers and teachers from Iași.
Among the signatory universities of the request in the Scottish academic environment is, for example, Professor Liviu Antonisei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to culture people who are also academic academic academics, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus making the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools which flagrantly violate the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance," the petition stated.
That petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarized schools have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility to IDEI grants.
Do you less respect a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence officer in the Middle East?
"Why do there not exist in Europe other academies to give doctorates organized by secret services, and the senior military who give the doctorate do it to the autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, who initiated the petition, originally from Iasi.
This can be supplemented by all the desires on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iași" party, founded by young IT managers who were not political affiliates, was launched earlier in Copou Park.
The president of the "For Iași" Initiative Group interviewed "Iași Day"
The Iash will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of political non-affiliated entrepreneurs and managers so far launched last week the Party for Iasi organization that will propose candidates to the 2016 local elections.
The party's core is currently made up of IT specialists, but the formation's initiators say that all people who want to be involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and more than 200 sympathizers participated in the event, almost all being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Bucharest Saved Association.
He was surprised by the 2012 local elections when, from the position of independent, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of the supporters for the function of mayor of the Capital.
"The people I saw at "For Iași" think they're very good to access the Iaş public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think he has chances, I think he may have more chances in a smaller community than in Bucharest.
"I will always be with "For Iași," said Nicusșor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company from abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've lived in Cluj for a year.
I came back every time, because I felt like this is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now that we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have been getting to know each other for some time.
We met in the professional context, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we became more timid, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organic and now it happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we had to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration business more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimal informationization of the city's activities so that the various departments, institutions and governments can work together as well.
But more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data on activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about informational organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to public consultation of the people affected.
If we talk about efficiency, we must not forget the common transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
We need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is extremely important.
How did you promote the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: Get on the plane and look for investors from this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and you know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iași.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a technology city in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go into medicine, go into the robotics area, go into the 3D printing area, go on in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here at the modern brand of the city.
Of course, the Iash already has a historic brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and running projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we'll not just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought with the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should the Mayor of Iash be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or is it necessary that the area of concerns be permanently of the edilitar nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without one does not work.
First you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't attract money in the city, at some point you're out of money and you won't be able to make, for example, streets.
They both need to be done at the same time and they need people with skills next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the mayor-father's model, which comes and beats the punch in the mass and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area to the party who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have an unsatisfied reputation, be clear and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was set up, after seven years of being the director of the Endava international issue (2008 - 2015), where it coordinated a team of 300 people.
Four more years (2003 - 2007) spent them at Synygy.
The company he set up with another IT specialist offers management consulting services.
The Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor park and agricultural machinery, initiated in 2011, also called Rabla for tractors, was a failure because of bureaucracy.
Related to the Rabla Program, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proven to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program he managed to sell somewhere to 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred annual tractors, the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those who come out, all the world's producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things I've told you, and they have special policies.
"At all fairs there is a great agglomeration, all producers exhibit, the entirely variant comes," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla programme for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could teach them and receive instead a voucher of 17,000 lei.
The red flag rose
The internal election of the workers seems more spectacular and more significant politically, as the new leader automatically becomes his peak in the upcoming elections.
Raise, therefore, the red-lit flag/ Under his skirts we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang in the London pub Sanctuary House yesterday.
He's witnessed many facts and oaths. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial anthem of the British and international left (The Red Flag/ Red Flag) can search the Internet and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear - that we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and those that float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining the left of yesterday with that of tomorrow, this love story between him and the base of the Labour Party will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think that's going to happen like this, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat of a leader chosen earlier.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive extent.
British Labour did not invent the voting system directly for the party leader in the western left.
French Socialists have been practicing for a few years a more complicated, motion-based system that allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have held a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate in 2012.
However, the internal election of the workers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new leader chooses automatically becomes his top lance in the upcoming elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of the political system, the customization of power being pronounced in Britain more than on the other side of the Channel of the Hand.
In addition, the participation in the vote was large in all three "searches": members of their own, members of the trade unions and other affiliated organisations of the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary of the registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of the left segments of British society, in particular those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to get even more involved, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this laburist 'external search', so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet enough attitudes similar to those of sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an anti-system vocation, it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a disguised form of the much-hout thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they did not delineate firmly from the Tony Blair era.
The second landmark - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Scotland's independence.
If we abstract the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations on other political issues, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments that are favourable to the social state and animated by the aspirations of equity, followers of disarmament and hostile military involvement everywhere, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish workers thus lost an electorate to which they should at least have a privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Such energies exist everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labourist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the anti-system left in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we'll learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the red flag will somehow rejuvenate in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader has occupied his place, first of the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unit - and in this regard he even has reason to be concerned.
Trap of manipulation with or without good science
As I wrote the article, I went through my mind to check on the story of the former fighter and "Syrian commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part two of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me out of the open circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel two pictures - that with little Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and that, in fact, the two showing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh I took it from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Wave of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handle pull from the friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a clarification. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate the groolana in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt sick.
Even more so while I wrote the article, I went through my mind to check on the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part two of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, in his journalists.
On the other hand, I didn't have another comment on Marius Cristian's hand-drawn hand than this: "I need this if I (have) trust in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story to cash and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest one we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader searches Europe - Syrian rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the Kos island of Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man who was trying to make order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian stork Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who is "normally in command" since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war."
We also learn that Al Saleh, a 30-year-old, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before he started a fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the Syrian population".
In the interview with Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells us that "everyone wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous Urbes in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me - I have fought against everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from the government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we find out that Laith (which means a lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, where he had a cousin - a former senior officer in the Syrian army and then became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly old with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this success, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the struggle for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
Crazy - who wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but the third!
I've gone over a Serbian material from 22 August, of which I didn't understand much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come with migrants: TERORISTS SE KRIJU MEÂU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news on http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which there's a picture of Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in his hand and the refugee flag in which he wears the THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7, then, on the BBC website itself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS fitter posing as a refuge - This viral picture claims wrong that it portrays an Islamic State fighter putting in refuge.
We find out that the photo (in fact: pictures - Laith with beard and gun and THANK YOU T-shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook who would have been and apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, just on his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been shared more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse had left!
In Romania, on 9 September, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took over the story with the manipulation of the BBC, while translating the wrong title: "A false photo became the virus shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, not photography is false, but interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulative.
21-year-old champion
Winner in the Iash rally, Simone Stormini assured his national title at the rally, becoming the youngest in the history of the championship
The 2015 Ias Cotnari rally ended with a result to the fans of the young driver Simone Stormini, Italian with Romanian citizenship, who at 21 years of age won all the new special evidence of the most difficult stages of the National Rally Championship.
