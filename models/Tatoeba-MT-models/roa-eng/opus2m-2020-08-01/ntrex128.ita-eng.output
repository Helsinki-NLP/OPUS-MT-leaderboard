Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned to "make the figure of clowns"
Some members of the House are dismayed at the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament of Wales).
This proposal comes as a result of the programmes to amend the name of the assembly in Parliament of Wales.
The members of the House of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it may be left with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means dick and pwp means cock.
One member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" towards the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (straw).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the Assembly will be called will of course be a matter of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided extensive support for the possibility of calling the Assembly of Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater agreement in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a grubbing-up for President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to referendum polls on the country name change
On Sunday the voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to put an end to a dispute that has been taking place for decades with bordering Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the change of the name, said that he would not take the result of the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shut up while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There's neither of us today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will go back where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternity before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the sellers of the 125th street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colored people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the charillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a bigger carillon at the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What was staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay officials of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese " attempted to download costs" on the parish assembly although the parish had not been involved in the assumption of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark hurts a thirteen-year-old lobster fishing dive in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in search of lobster in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him together with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was crying 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was lacered," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The beachguard Captain Larry Giles declared during a communication to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was traumatized in the upper chest area.
The authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a push towards beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to the beauty products of the great warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important push towards the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty product market, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decrease, the largest beauty products lanes will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in more stores next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of beauty items to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those present in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the seller of fragrances The Fragrance Shop will experience authorisations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will increasingly resemble large stores while the chain of supermarkets tries to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to return enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical department ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but synergy ended in a dispute over the distribution of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sales to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extensive range of luxury leather care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angerful" after Holly Willoughby takes off on an 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with her trend mark to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housekeepings and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter resorted to Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable trendy activity at the last minute to focus on his exceptional new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "angerous" when the gold girl on the TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - worth 1.5 million pounds - did not allow them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of homewives and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his Truly abandonment, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It must have been his long-term future that he would have committed for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the strong investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent together the holidays and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telelegor conductor".
"I have not given up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the USA to the first North Korea disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to keep pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 outside people trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," said Trump, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency was not declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumuk said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will be visiting Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
As a result, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although some tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo put at the centre of his electoral campaign the improvement of infrastructure to the brands of Indonesia and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressure from the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been driven away from their homes because of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who are fighting using machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool stands against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while located about 25 meters from the Chelsea door, with his team under for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he pulled the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and sat on the net.
"It was enough to try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I touched and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
Blue's centermen went by heels to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off near the half-field and taking off in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to midfield.
So he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a sinister goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round-up of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, declared the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were reported trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the country on Friday and which generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been swept away by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and to invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on Dashcam, so that they can contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of the rendezvous this morning.
The investigations are under way and the police have stated that they are currently informing the family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 1400 two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the delimited area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information on this subject is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating record 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the wave of "rewriting of history"
His departure would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer blows up a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a narrow artery, covered with blood near a pig in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pigs with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had broken the farmer, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and bruised," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to get rid of the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba breeder told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious .... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The rose hurricane straddling will bring heavy rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the south-west coast of the USA in the next days.
Rosa recorded twenty up to 138 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, at 5 ET Sunday hours and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a bag is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will start pushing a strong tropical humidity north, in the southwestern part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the surrounding bag will create heavy and vast rainfall in the south-west area in the next days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible debris in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at certain points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, especially on much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture in the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the canyons of rivers full and the storms will bring wind to dust and raise dust.
The approaching bag will cause heavy rain at the local level on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of slippery debris and lanes.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the humid season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become wider at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will descend on Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperature on the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to important changes in temperature over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the central USA will be seen on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer's remaining heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected a warm beginning of October for much of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our forecasts for the long-term climate indicate strong temperatures above average for the eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday six television networks the successful deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute event on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had beaten her in a state of drunkenness and tried to strip her up during a superior party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to count the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience throughout the day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican's office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken back by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes while being reproached and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the hearing of the committee.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the appointment of Kavanaugh to the whole Senate for one vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
The choice of Flake was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his programs of letting the European Union "political face" with the future of Britain and jeopardised national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU have to collect their duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Homicide of Wayde Sims: Police Arrests Suspected Killer of LSU Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect of death by gun by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on a second-degree murder charge, declared Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge's Office of the Legal Physician issued a preliminary report on Friday, in which it states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the State of Louisiana police, the police scientist's laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked the local order forces for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The attacker of 198 cm grew up in Baton Rouge, where also his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds at the game.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade stated that the team is "convoluted" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Vulcan ash cosparge Mexico City
The ash that comes out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was checking the different waves and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in connection with the volcano that is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters met with police anti-sommous teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-sommous police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
Further clashes occurred during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with the demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx had been low, and the Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop the referendum that was taking place in the entire region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had gathered on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no more hopes on the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry of joy for the chance to vote, but now it's all blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory, although of measure at the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have made it difficult to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fuelled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the evolution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after spooking a house with cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a bullet at a certain point.
The Menga attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers astonished by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the club of Hebox.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore without an out-of-home victory in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first Hearts class next Sunday, from which they separate 8 points.
Thursday the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile the Livingston continues his series of wins in the division remaining unbeatable for six matches, with Coach Holt who has yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage long before the goal, with their immediateity that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson collapsed but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he joined to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put the visitors in trouble with high heels.
And that is how the crucial goal has been achieved.
The Rangers gave a penalty kick and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to move on to Menga, which could mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession of a ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the doorman Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal shot stopped by the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's goalkeeper's feet shot out of another Livingston gaming scheme.
Crosses happened in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two rigorous requests, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand failure, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and the collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he knew how to spring the team from his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, led by a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall into trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below those standards.
It was missing the last step - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
There have been discussions on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have for security reasons motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accidents in Deptford: cyclist dies in conflict with a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficked road in Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the Saturday accident occurred.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum-security male prison, reported the prison office.
The tumult exploded at Long Lartin's maximum-security male prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still underway.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were used to manage the tumult, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on site for slight facial injuries.
A prison officer said: "Personal prison specifically trained has been deployed to contain an accident currently taking place at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sommous agents were called to intervene in the prison to heal a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Sudden Floods (of which the drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but this is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already released sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for hurricanes predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls will probably be positive because the South-West region is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the drought monitoring centre, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead to the mainland through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will emerge with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico may be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and towards South Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or by her straddlings are intense rainfall in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert area of the USA," said the National Center for Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains can generate potentially lethal flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as debris on mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 p.m. BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remained in "steady" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities appealed to anyone who could have taken back what happened with the telephone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decided the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against her decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed a defense against the prosecution.
The President declared on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced minds of the law of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented precedents in public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh by discussing the importance of republican influx to midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really have to do it," he said.
"That's why I fight hard for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first basic procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, as stated to CNN a senior assistant to the GOP management.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many being washed away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, washing away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't just come, dragged with itself cars, logs, houses, hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, rounded and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shocks of harassment continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extesi" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed, with no information" by Donggala said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on a top floor of a building shouting agitated way to warn of the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The airport of the city was reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami victims' balance sheet in Indonesia goes up to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where the employees took refuge under canvas shelters locked in their office yard, during the trip they met scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"I've been told I've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while rescue groups began the difficult start-up operations of rescue gears, there were some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations provide that funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared an area of national catastrophe.
And that has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family members of the missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the preparation of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray output instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealing thieves $26,750 during an ATM supply at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was resupplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, based on a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver another money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While busy, another man "got off behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, as reported, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name in Ye · Global Voices
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced on Saturday the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before his participation in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
Replaces in the program the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our badness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator from West, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking their toll across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by increasing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funds in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow the announcements by different groups of the US government about AI, although in the USA there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its programme last year: it looks forward to being the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
"To double the budget in the search for AI would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the USA and we need a new revolution in the AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next great success in the AI sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the U.S. player of Otello with the highest score and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous U.S. government technological competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you will be holding the next one, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking leaders away in academics, it's multinationals," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken on luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its AI efforts.
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Sciences and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defence of the USA set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial partners and universities and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the US order to create a National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and placed the veto at the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments have signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents believe that change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority-slave population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the possibility of the influx reaching the minimum of 50% necessary for the referendum's validity.
The request on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with accession to NATO and the EU and with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that it will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a two-thirds majority.
The State Electoral Commission has stated that there have been no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change in the name of the country that would open the door to accession to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarvarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up, not for the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO will bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the philo-Western government since it settled in May last year.
Guarda: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 win match from Manchester City Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point marked at 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentine attacker received a half-field passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green meshes.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming several others at the limit of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat the doorman of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right in the network.
"He's having problems at his feet," Pep Guardiola told the journalists the coach of the City.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to score at the time."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of the Sky Blues in the struggle for the Premier League.
The goal came to the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filtering ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball in the net just before he left the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a catch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play aimlessly, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to race?"
Nationals still need to announce a first launcher on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first pitcher for the 34th time, performed a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump at a gathering in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the influx of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into question in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really trying to do this because I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Let's see this awful group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, it is possible to see evil, meanness.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to stumble in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it's been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angered, mean, mean and lying."
He referred to the Justice Commission of the Senate with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong cracks between the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the document?
Um, uh, what.
No, erm no, look one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "most kind and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of trend on my part and to take positions I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - they follow insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of insults to a sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have been fine".
But it is not to do this that I have entered into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the intrigue of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally fall apart, I tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way puzzled by my political positions and by points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing to a Brexit that will damage the family nuclei, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defence of those I think are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeated Ayr scale the classification
Two late attempts might somehow have unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennant's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the ranking, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their daringness, who pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still beaten, so I have to be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "We must recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grasped an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, in half time, to score and therefore to convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted from Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was caused to stretch, and upon restarting, the Ayr was rocked again to the advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The alternate captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay more with an unconverted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
But the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advance mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star Still Game looks for a new career in catering
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move on to the hotel sector after the discovery of being appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, who writes and plays together with the long-standing Greg Hemphill partner.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a Scottish Sun source made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosper food trade" of Glasgow.
''The sea is ours': Bolivia has no outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered in sartia in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without a mouth over the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to rock once again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a lot to do with the Monday ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrives just six months after the final elections indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years might have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric broke any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations to a certain extent, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly timely.
On Monday Bolivia will be able to "joy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with each other," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political scandal.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong I said that his nation will never commit nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington before.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to uphold the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be planning to restart diplomatic negotiations in a state of stagnation after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is "an illusion" that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the USA to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea to its knees.
Washington refuses to issue the statement without first making important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge covers that soon will be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to expand your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look beyond.
Valentino and Thom Browne stylists have unveiled a series of crazy oversized covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their captivating creations on the walkway.
The main piece of Valentino was an exaggerated hat of beige color decorated with a wide edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled corners, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have a sewn lip and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than a high-couture.
One creation looked like a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a loose ice-cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the tail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide tie over a meter that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat very little practical that invaded the social media sent another huge creation in the walkway: a beach bag in large straw almost as the model in costume that carries it.
The burnt orange ray bag, finished with scratched fringes and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags will arrive in the luxury stores next summer, as the designer has achieved such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent Scottish schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results to the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, career choices and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a field of education able to develop and adopt a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and required within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only English if we want to create trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the highest vote.
Data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will certainly need them in the future.
At present, languages, such as choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
With increasing job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will lead a multilingual person automatically to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to be able to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason investing in language teaching is so important to children today.
Knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the specialized teaching staff in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative competences."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do this right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entrance with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday pre-champed opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be established for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six Lakers' pre-champion games program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The time of the Trump West Virginia gathering, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally.
This is the first of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress at the November elections.
At what time will Trump's start and how is it possible to follow it online?
Trump's conference in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's West Virginia online game via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense because of the charges of sexual violence with a vote of early confirmation of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings next week are aimed at "to give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel in as many states as possible as we are entering the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesperson of Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for Wheeling's Wesbank Arena, tonight's committee could call back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh's media coverage," based on West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he had won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician, based in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday individuals
After three unique sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the swing pendulum is a totally invented sport concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, for the benefit of four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not since last the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three out of four points.
Spieth was spied from tee to green and he's setting the example.
The guestural shouts of celebration became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts at Game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the game at the 15 hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmisputable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That journey, and the way in which their energy seems to flow from and to the noisy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon arrived at Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have smothered the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they have not even managed to get back.
However, there's no one on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Statesside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the fourball and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National so far to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. endured mostly in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 matches of Sunday individuals to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European leader to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat down a fallen Woods and the American scholar Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged for two games on Saturday, showed occasional explosions of genius but lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and forsomes and sevens of a row.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's fourballs, went back to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the forssomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results on a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a sharp 2&1 victory on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point discount passing to individuals, although as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday deal seems to be out of reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea declared to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's confidence in the USA, which in these circumstances would absolutely refuse to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time."
Although Ri re-uses the lamentation notes concerning Washington's resistance to a "in-phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end-to-end agreement to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have denuclearization first" and to increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even oppose the "war-end declaration," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our confidence."
Ri did not refer to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader announced at the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart to this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target the US territory with North Korea's missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage to undertake the course of disarmament, but said that much has to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The respect of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and determined denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He went from Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of having filed "gangster demands."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the USA had adopted "conform measures."
He said that Kim had explained to him that the "conformity measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to Singapore and actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all its students to sleep more in the attempt to counter the growing virile culture of studying for entire nights fueled by caffeine.
One university scholar found that college students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this type in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"In the end a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this told only now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe sleeplessness during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gymnastics shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a constantly growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain in mode of inedia, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year in his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set a wake-up for when they need to go to bed, as well as for when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm to tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticolated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Hemox was looking for the first win out of the house from February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games by leaving his team eight points away from the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Ranger training never seemed able to match.
As the Ranger now descends to the sixth place, the Livingston climbs to the third place, and only behind the Hibernian by difference of goal.
And there could be additional problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently launched from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly passed the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that ripped a dot at Hearts last week and would be satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered for possession of ball but Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filter passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door, but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment football by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his companion in defense Alan Lithgow was only able to pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took over but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to see to assign a rigor to the expiration of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the door in the first time but the former carrier of Ibrox Liam Kelly did not get worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opening goal of Livingston at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it only because of his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed in Jacobs depth.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing pushed a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw herself off the doorline to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who picked one long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton filed a final request for rigour after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTENGIO continues... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of atoms released from radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "It's going off a little bit now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can therefore "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then reinjected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovary cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and so these cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumor", including that of the breast, the ovaries, the lungs and the colon-right, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumour cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws into a pro-Trump diatra wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was flogged in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an inconclusive performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would apply in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the recording of West's Filippica was loaded on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to play West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public about having spent a bad time in the backstage because of its cover.
"I got bullied in the backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd be in Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try the love."
His comments generated fisces at least twice from the audience and the members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, said Variety, with a person who told the magazine: "In the studio there has been a deadly silence."
West was invited as a replacement for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has bewildered many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised by Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO HAVE TEXT TO MASS."
But the conductor of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West was just "what it is and that's just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing a repulsive ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the music legend disappeared Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and therefore in the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast east Friday.

The accused must present himself at the pretature of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
Sword Throne Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Sword Throne.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the male hero's stereotype, stating that such on-screen soils often make kids believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of the Sword Throne, 31 years old, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
'Personally I worry, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think that they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel of Tron of Sword after finishing the series the next summer, stating that "have finished with battlefields and horses'.
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this way my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winner of Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, according to what the Chinese health authorities said during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Due to the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has leaked the data from the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous bogies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. deputy denounced the charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles stated that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the "extreme right wing".
"Bugies, lies and still despicable lies" said the Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Public information would include addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a panel of experts on charges of sexual violence against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts has been associated with the Waters office and have issued information concerning a member of the Waters staff.
"This false accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been jeopardised as a result of these false and biased accusations, has in no way been responsible for the escape of such information.
This false accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone gets accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It must not be provocative.
You must not question the reasons of the accuser.
It must remain calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of looking too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office has alerted "the competent authorities and the law enforcement forces of these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English review still hits - the parody of the spy with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veil of self-reliance on how much rubbish we do be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for countries of non-English cinema producers.
Obviously it is the foolish secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme Gloria's moments of the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony.
This is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveller who once Atkinson played in Barclaycard's forgotten television ads, which left chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English to approach the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers squirm briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "seri" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comity as an ingredient.
Humour seems directed to children rather than to adults and for me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not so original and targeted as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he plays Mr Bean.
The immutable headline now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with disappointment of the officer in charge, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that brings the pot to pieces for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering from a breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school manager at a chic establishment, but also teaches official lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a spying course like School of Rock.
English is rebaptized to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of the disasters for His Majesty's secret services are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised by waiters, they put the fire in a French restaurant; they trigger hell by smuggled into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take dimestics with the inside of Volta's house.
All of the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but however neat and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although being paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the Party's economic programme and with plans to tilt the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a four-day day was endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a revision of the political line is expected."
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from "faceless" and "speculators" managers in public services companies.
The shadow chancellor plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviors considered illegal.
It has also confirmed the plans to include employees in business boards and to create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10% of the private sector's net assets to employees, which end up in annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raised doubts as to whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will go on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI will bring to light something that could induce them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it while I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I see nothing new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the display of a remarkable star cart and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that helped to raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now been to 12 years to achieve the stated goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to request an appeal to action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktimism"- people who feel they really make the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, operated for a variety of purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than 37 billion dollars, intended to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads arising from their actions, of which they have already been paid out or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far the protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to appeal to the United Kingdom for better nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favour of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website, which asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we frame and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, "if necessary", use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's southern core," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so as to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Moscow's "prisoner" Berlin.
Moscow has shown several times that the North Stream 2, gasted from 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Cremlin objects that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary for Energy of the United States.
The US position triggered Germany's negative reaction, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to remain outside the EU's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of running for the Presidency in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will take "serious consideration" of becoming president following the mid-term elections.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he had the opportunity to apply.
"It's time that women go to Washington and set up our clumsy government, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy as President."
During the Warren City Assembly he said his on President Donald Trump, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticising Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by him appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It is natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters themselves do not believe that they should run in 2020.
58 percent "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32 per cent supported such an application.
The survey received greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% to support potential candidacy and 48% to the contrary.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What's happening to my son, what's going on after his return, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," he told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "turn a bit different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia Friday presented an amicus curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the call Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been put in a state of arrest in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing gang problems and domestic violence.
The new United States asylum policy overturned a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without documents fleeing from domestic violence.
Friday the Attorney General of Columbia District Karl Racine declared that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular events and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says amicus curiae in his memory.
In memory the prosecutors also objected that the policy that bans the entry of immigrants damages the economy of the United States, asserting the clear probability that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop securing asylum for victims on the run from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Holiday is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or to a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought to mitigate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts at recovery in Palu while the dead budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little feverish child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At all times there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen back to their destroyed homes, wandering among their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, were filled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a broken shoulder and back, were resting outside Palu's military hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of the constant shocks of harassment.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the feeling given by the violent earthquake that shook the room that he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed among the debris of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "making prepowers" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a US newspaper, advertising the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional Elections of November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation made by Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to get involved in the US elections, pointed out what U.S. officials reported to Reuters to be a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While for foreign governments it is normal to advertise trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war that saw them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war had been designed to hit exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, as the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and formerly Governor of Iowa, the great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those prepowers by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceful, in the street editorial here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the differing views that the Chinese population might have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm hold of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the greatest newspapers in China has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although it did not state what newspaper it is.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the half term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various charges for sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that there will be a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, in the future mid-term elections.
The agitation in this respect has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You cannot withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that the insistence of Senator Jeff Flake's last minute (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it neither tomorrow nor November," said Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already tall; that's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians of the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts had assumed that a negative reaction might have occurred if the Republicans had continued with confirmation.
"For the GOP it became a confusing set," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote for the committee, about the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put in the panel, it's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably lied or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh attacked him in the state of Judaism when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez submits that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals during a party during studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that comes from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "on-line personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to choose who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers from all over the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not say to "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely thrown out from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiast of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only churchman in England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was granted recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had obtained the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial slab.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under the heavy fire of the field and war machines".
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest galanteria" moved the line forward before he ran with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that he will be given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose programme included 13 combats, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, viewers in the UK were stucco when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some of them remained basic after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the move to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government's regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig", "yes."
"The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six on Sunday mornings and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages arrived and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he has grown feeling less than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to high school, the fact that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking in the first Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months free for disease.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else while growing up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both boys and girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The twice bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used its face in this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice hear because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "I was struck by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said that age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so many at this young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be around here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized it was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew that was what I had dreamed for my whole life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out form Mickelson put in the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an infallible milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time as a record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has often been the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what torments him.
Since he has never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected path regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the careful champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, with four points below the beginning of their 12 single games, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect to play two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went, and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never even far reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
"It's fun, sarcasm, witty, he likes to play with people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that younger players have had a good time to sit down against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did much more than play"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable resort.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captain of Sive Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep repeating that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but very little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"So it will be the story to prove to me and to my team that it is not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
We need to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the canvas.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on my team's 12 players, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy the way his men competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have overcome myself.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then, forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look for in its players the best individual performance more than on a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself was found by both sides at those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to leave immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in intermediate matches.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that we seem appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterfensitive and confronting Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the route to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last strike of the German military Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be until next year because of defective systems and a heavy cost.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the admiral ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the military Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuous delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will already become obsolete when they come into service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 type wrecked reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the boat yard Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noticed a number of crucial "flawful software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has emerged that the ship weighs heavily too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the military Navy's ability to add future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached the 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "carses ships capable of being employed".
The official stated that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret was that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the military Navy.
The National Trust spies the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Highland estate in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the view to get food.
It is confident that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, in addition to the brown ears and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The sound analyses recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
They will then produce a habitat map and a report to create a detailed framework on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for nature protection for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The bats are at risk because of construction and development works that affect trespoles and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as mossicide paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect trespolies and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland for bats only in the estate of Three, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, states that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Three we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
Stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal trespolus can kill up to 400 females and small, perhaps by sweeping away a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trebles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations pass it."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled the charges of rape against him as "false news", stating that people "wanted to advertise themselves" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made known on Friday the charge of the payment of $375,000 to maintain silence on the event.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, slammed the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five times Golden Ball pointing to the camera.
"They want to be advertised through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by doing my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the charges, called "an inadmissible report of suspicions about the private sphere".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will claim compensation for "moral damages to the extent that the violation of privacy is serious, considered, probably, one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a disco, Ronaldo and Majorga would be back in the footballer's room, where he had been subjected to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga contends that Ronaldo would kneel after the event saying that he was for the "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by the "one percent".
From the documents it appears that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Majorga also states that she went to the police and the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but that she later agreed to a conciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "coming publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the agreement, arguing that it is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United to the time of the event, and this summer he will join the Italian Juventus with a €100 million contract.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "may regret forever" the loss of its position as world leader in car construction following Brexit," said Greg Clark Industry Minister.
He also added to be "anxious" for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC on the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent temporary blockade of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car company claims that delays to borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are building, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases concern in other British car manufacturers for exit from the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, argues that after Brexit it will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for cars on order.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, there could be inconveniences at the borders which would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, said the company, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these inconveniences at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The test, not only by Toyota but also by other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what was a successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long run it warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaton for 24 years and is responsible for the union representatives of the plant, declares that the workers are deeply concerned: "According to my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated".
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Vice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "recommendated for a week," while continuing the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh, declared the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with the elections, links between Trump's councillors and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby putting Mueller's independence at risk, fuelled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a monkey to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and spoke of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced by Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's education of questions from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be a week later considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might dispute this statement: Sanders does not hold a press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings is not due to an aversion to television journalists "that show up", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show up".
So it made me think that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The President holds more questions and answers than any President before him," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have checked the figures".
The briefings will still be there, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this, as in recent weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has perhaps shown the reason for this, making a free-wheeled speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance from the United Kingdom's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of requests for settled status (stable resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "We have continued negotiations throughout the summer between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31 to 27, as reported Mike Organ of the newspaper The Tennessee.
The Technical Manager Rod Reed told the journalists that the accident that caused the wound occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached on board the field and passed out," Reed said.
First aid staff and medical staff administered oxygen Abercrombie on board camp before placing it in a barrel and taking it away for further verifications.
A manager of the Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no news yet about the type and size of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with the Tennessee State after moving to Illinois.
He had made a total of five plates before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the workers
The maneuver will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce today Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide accommodation at a higher affordable price and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the homeless.
The overhead, which adds to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and properties buy to lets (purchase to be rented), could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry expects the maneuver to collect up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house into the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy came a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a stamp tax cut to help younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking over land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up allowances on affordable housing to fix the British 'real estate misfortune'.
Mr Corbyn has announced a bright set of proposals for reforming the housing market, including controls on rents and the elimination of innocent waste.
He also wants to give the council more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, that is, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the dignity of homeless people remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland's Technical Director, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become a Scottish manager sooner or later.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of raising the North-East team that is currently in third place in the League One, three points from the summit.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a soccer player.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician claims to feel no anxiety in following up on such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now is measured with the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the club's structure and facilities, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I get the team back."
The start of Ross's manager career dates back to three years ago, after a period as a coach assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement heart coach.
He then helped Alloa to save herself from the retrocession to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the edge of the retrocession to the title of champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really thought the role of manager was right for me, more than the role of player.
Seems strange because I worked well, I made a living and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with every week.
I still face them in terms of work stress and pressure, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has brought more cash to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to the catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales from 2.7 percent in July, while the incs of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the World Cup led to July following a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you mostly drink were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase above the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not in an excessive way as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In the pubs and in the bars managed the sales of drinks have risen by 6.6 percent in the month, while the consumption of food has decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreation and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of the main social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly heavy in addition to continuous pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, of which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce".
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-outs of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for UK pubs, bars and restaurants combines and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's reference company.
One in five child owns secret social network accounts that hides parents
A survey reveals that one child in five, some in only 11 years, owns secret social network accounts that hides from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
20% of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One child in five, some in only 11 years, creates accounts of social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of the "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said that they manage a "principal" account that is clean to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who discovered by chance the secret site of the 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "buy me".
The research, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference of private schools (HMC), showed that 40% of boys between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted by creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Council of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a profound respect in the community of Scottish, British and World athletics and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could get a huge advantage by bringing it into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I can't wait to act as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can contribute and help drive sports in Scotland."
The American winner of the 1996 Atlanta Games of 200 and 400 metres and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as the BBC's current opinionist, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could have said if I had recovered and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, learned again to walk and today I move in agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!".
The advertising of a tyrillatte compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company that produces a tyrillatte has divided the opinion in network with an advertisement that compares the nursing mothers and the cows that come up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable tyrillattes of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tyrillatte.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm taking my milk but I don't have one thing" and, "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't moms but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Put him out, throw him out, feed the kids, throw him out, throw him out, throw the milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among the viewers, many of which claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the fact that their little ones are stolen from them a few days from birth," wrote someone.
The Elvie t-shirt is worn discreetly under a mother's bra
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the little one.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a tyranny for mothers who will continue to keep their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a nonsense advertisement."
Others have defended her and a woman has even admitted to finding the "fun" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used the t-shirt, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn't go far away from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use tyrlattes (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the household industry."
Finally, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tyrillatte stuck in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use tyralatte feel like cows.
However, Elvie's t-shirt is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck in a breast-feeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold the children in their arms and even get out while they are milking.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's tyralatte is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing women who use tyrillattes to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyrillatte is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie's t-raffle ever made news.
During the fashion week of London, the mother of two children presented herself on the walkway of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tentoples at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of the Trump administration made it more difficult to rely on these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardise the possibility of staying in the country by offering to make such a move.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who offered to take on their own children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to take children into custody or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt down these people," Albence said.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for which some of them will have to appear in court within one month from the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to what says who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, in order to bring their case of legal status to an immigration court.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work at the reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo where, due to its size, it is easier for the signs of distress of children to be ignored.
They add that the movement of children into the tendons without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could make the trauma that many are already facing worse.
Syria Intimates US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war has now arrived in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are occupying Syrian soil illegally on the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must retire immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted on the fact that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from the terrorist groups and from "any foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, which primarily train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable upon their return and accused "some Western countries" of "infected fears" that drive the refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be provided in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a bearing zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "needed deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who "will be uprooted".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene a new committee of members of the government and opposition soon to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee stating that the group's work must be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should not end prematurely because of impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of bending of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first night, definitely increasing from 1.7 million in four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire people are attracted to because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the television series of ABC "Designed Survival" that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the story of the events in Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Peara", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("a garment full of tracotance" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, won't be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what looks like a reality show is in the fact that every night there is news" says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the approval of actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. who praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He failed to get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was dealing with the Senate's judicial committee and facing the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when once we did all those stupid programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the narrowest half-term election race
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a flow of money due to the re-alignment of a Congressional District which has made two members now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the Pittsburg suburban district sparked the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania that overlaps to the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January deliberated that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favour of the republicans.
The 17th district race triggered a campaign characterized by a fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their mind
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather friendly meeting was held between Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's governing group to leave.
The officials of the State Department decided to bring the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama in response to the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," said the spokesman for the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was only taken against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading in the United States.
But in mid-September the senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thereby definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, say the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously of internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an outside analyst near the administration who still wanted to maintain anonymity.
Study history
In the report to be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now appears to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to turn to Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his peers as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the case with its counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to hold a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed by allowing ourselves to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the moment have to deal with it differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
The position of Rosenstein has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year it has secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to interceptions questioning his ability to fill the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the news on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, at the mid-term elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these trials, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to turn on the Sabbath candles with svastics.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over Austrians, after the convincing match obtained against Villareal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on his knees, the midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season right on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, believes that this result can enable the Rangers to do great things.
"For us, it was a positive result because Villareal is a good team," said 30-year-old player.
"We dealt with the game convinced of doing well and we brought home a point.
Perhaps we could have won at extremis, but, in short, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level itself, but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the kind of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the interviewees by Nationwide said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% claims to have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Involve a financial advisor: you can recommend how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of a procurator for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your old parent will be brought urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."

The victim didn't see his assailant.
He's not in any danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
The communications were interrupted and the rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Centrale province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had some 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and above all the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit western Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the Pacific fire belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a very strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226,000 people, of which more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke down against the southern coast by killing almost 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the Regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: a strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia by killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and for resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her hand phone off.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and his security was set at $500, as reported by the KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is likely to be accused of three crimes of first degree, namely holding up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also committed a second-degree offence punishable by a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan's Court of Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of having hindered the complaint of crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the accident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks do not work and the victims' budget is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, located to the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media shows videos showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors call for extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks at NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to dive on a cycling track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" also "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court's document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued charges to Saipov 22 counts that included eight charges of murder with association with crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation", said the prosecutors describing the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York pursued the last case of capital punishment.
The man quoted in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple both died in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, native to Uzbekistan, has shown no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that they were proud of what they did in front of the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With regard to the 22 heads of imputation, it was found to be not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept an acknowledgement of guilt and the condemnation of the hangman without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov group of defenders had previously begged the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be already out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party were emphasized by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the beginning of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"At this point we would already be outside Europe," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament added: "I am for Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would be changed from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Ms. Tory Andrea Jenkyns, supporter of Brexit, also participated in the procession and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote on it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who turn on the streets for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises".
At the beginning, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they intend to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe have marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour conference in the centre of the city.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit's flags after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labourer laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues they had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the boundless borders and for the boundless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a hoax.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren's seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren states that after the November elections he will seriously consider applying for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the democratic senator of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that could challenge Trump in 2020 was already in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled down.
One participant asked her if she would apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government and this implies that a woman is in the highest position."
Arrest for the murder of the player of the LSU Sims
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reportedly arrested a suspect for the murder of the basketball player Wayde Sims of the LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years, at 11:00 on ETNews.
Friday he had broadcast a video of the murder asking for help for the identification of a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to his head that caused his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and having hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in a state of detention at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
A junior player of almost two meters grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 meetings of which 10 were to be held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of comrade Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas went well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the tail traffic of the group, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes stops the next ride back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton however surpasses it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent it from going inside risking to finish off after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the gearboxes and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
At the end of the day, however, the pit stops at the 44th turn and in the remaining 8 laps it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and it was really nice to get me through.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of attempted rape of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by the Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "male, bad and lying".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being spread and those responsible say "oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't," she added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were disclosed in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is being breached by his office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his lie is not credible to the president, who, during the Saturday evening's start, commented: "I say, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the evilness. They don't care who harms, who they have to go over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately went to the advantage of two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the elite league season for the men of Adam Keefe who on Friday evening in Belfast had rebounded and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal at 3:35 a.m. on Kendall McFaull's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a fairly lively first time, Sullivan brought the home team back to match at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt provided the team assistant at Cownie at 15:16 a.m..
Dwyer has decreed the advantage for Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team has returned and Bouchard has regained the draw after a strategic maneuver at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundee to the advantage for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controllers die to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after being killed to allow a plane that carried hundreds of people to take off and put them out safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are dispersed due to a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong shocks of harassment continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the twenty-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande remained in his place in the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu, which was fearfully oscillating.
He wanted to make sure that the flight Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, stated that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's a very sad news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national agency for countermeasures for disasters reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," says the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
High waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by the CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now claims that there is a scatter after the lagoon incident
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people aboard passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a scatter.
According to the news of Air Niugini, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger misses the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, for example age or nationality.
The local boats allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the accident while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the United States Navy claim that the plane is precipitated into the lagoon because it has not reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low altitude.
"Ed was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the aircraft's emergency exits.
He added that flight attendants were panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit to the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a bridge have provided help using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the plane went into an altitude of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people died in aircraft accidents of the aircraft lines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burnt woman alive
Saturday the presentation of the evidence of the charge in the new trial against a man accused of having burned a woman from the Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst of the Department of Justice of the United States of America Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell data to rebuild the movement of the twenty-ninth accused Quinton Tellis and the victim of the 19th year Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data of several cell phones demonstrating that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth saying that that night was in the Sanford truck, he confirmed that he was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, cell data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis deleted from his phone the messages, calls and contact information of the Chambers.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the court to pass judgment later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop aware?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of this genre by inserting positive messages into its tracks.
The High Breed Group in Bristol argues that the hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
They want to go back to their origins and make again a kind of hip-hop aware.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK with characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny quotes a couple in court for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York a nanny cited a couple in court for having dismissed her discriminatoryly after she had received a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist comparing the request to a true "storage".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER NERA," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "pregnant" fired Miss Maurice saying she was not satisfied with their previous nanny, an African American, and expected a Filipino.
She paid Miss Maurice for her day at work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to have been dismissed, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, although without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like that," he said Friday at the Post adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the charge of racism by stating that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her a message saying something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said her husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you were stocked, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "distortion", Plasco said that the wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get along with a person like that.
It is not a very kind behaviour," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has repeatedly denounced the spouses on social media by harshly criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter as follows: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success from Paddington."
I would argue that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, which you describe as "a very important member of our family," he adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a calm man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted as if he had a son who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not your credit.
I think he would interpret Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, it attributed the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter's phone that she was dying.
At the landing the daughter was transported urgently to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then he called me to tell me she'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly becoming more reliable.
She died a while before and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, grieved for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other unknown passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"All the time I've done nothing but crying low-headedly.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Tickets of two women who are pained to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide committed themselves to preventing others from making the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, tells that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said he lit every room he came into."
But before he died he left the job because the depression had brought him "into a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to be isolated, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost his 15-year-old boyfriend Mark not long after his mother's death.
"You never said you felt down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day touched the background. When the children opened the gifts, they avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He has torn the family apart.
He broke us.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI began its investigations
"I think that if we could proceed as requested, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission was "losing calm" because of the blockade of the root supporters.
Why doesn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left at the mid-term elections, on 6 November. If the Republicans as planned will achieve a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man who has chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators in pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data of the Ministry of South Korean unification, states that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates asked by those who illegally bring these people out.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of refugees in North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the negotiations on denuclearisation that are in a standstill situation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and in these circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament for the first time," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "steric" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate for the "steric" Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and states that it is not characteristically suitable to fulfill this assignment.
Pelosi delivered this opinion on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called it hysterical," Pelosi said about the statement made by Kavanaugh on Thursday before the Senate's judicial committee.
In a visibly excited way, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in emotional distress, so much so that he could almost scream and with his throat narrowed from the cry as he spoke of his family and of the years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democrats who defined the charges against him as a "absured and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has been warned against democrats.
"I think he's self-exclusion with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh on charges in case it was confirmed and whether democrats should reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court that now presides," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is at the moment a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for its confirmation, Kavanaugh elucidated questions about his intention to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said that "You cannot send a hysterical person and a member of the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive manner".
And women must use it.
It's a fair diatra, months and years of anger attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere. She told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought his was a brilliant idea."
Tears are tolerated as a source of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories that I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying for anger access. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified caught me for the collar and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever show you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they have you in their fists."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital relationship was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business that had to give up the race, the very disappointed Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't really a well-considered decision," he told me laughing at us over 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and certainly did not need another one.
Someone called them "Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and he swore he would not apply if he had not collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause on the way out.
She discovered that some of the supporters who had given men $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he gave the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (free for the people who had supported him, disappointment to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was the victim of), that he was moved.
"He seemed to be in a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder thinking about the press reaction.
"Someone might have thought that Kleinex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "Pise a lot."
How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening strikes of the US-China trade war have been fragile and, while the battle is still over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on articles for over 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted with similar measures each time by recently applying duties from five to ten percent of US$60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US coup and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon move back.
For Washington to resign, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US can positively influence China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is indeed much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Research Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of the refugees and is looking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid conditional on conditions or on the part of those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score from 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, in France.
The USA has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and do not win a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The USA Phil Mickelson champion, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole in par 3 by giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his tournaments becoming one of the four players who has always recorded a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his fellow John Ram who beat the legend of the U.S. Tiger Woods golf with the score of 2&1 in Sunday singulars.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said the twenty-first Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in the Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk declared after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the team Europe.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all in.
But they played better than we did."
