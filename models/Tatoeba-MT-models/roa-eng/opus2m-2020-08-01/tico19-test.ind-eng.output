The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that grew rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and Britain Raya, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed similar trends in the European Union/Eurasian Economic Territory that confirmed that, although its different stages depend on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly across the country.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units, the COVID-19 patient will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of unknown cases of pneumonia reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiongkok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported a kausative agent of this disease is the new coronavirus that is now called heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers suffer from mild disease, that is, infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients being cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and required hospital care, while another 6% experienced critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital because of COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we studied the cumulative COVID-19 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it to the incident in Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a more geographical and dynamic spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world at this time following the dynamics of the pandemic in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed based on the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases first reported by the French on January 24, 2020 to those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected throughout 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date included, there are 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and the cumulative incident COVID-19 case
At the European Disease Prevention and Control Center (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported to every country in the world is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. This amount is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Ministry, the national and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it to the train in Italy.
As the prevalence of active COVID-19, we calculated the 14-day cumulative incident, so we calculated the COVID-19 natural journey, in every EU/EEA and UK country, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases that were reported by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. compared to Italy during the period 31 January–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The cumulative train incident is 14 days in the COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA and the UK generally follows the train in the Province of Hubei (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to increase about 21 February, and then increased sharply by 28 February 2020.
This train is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar COVID-19 cumulative increase trend.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared with the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlights that, until March 15 at 8:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The train that is observed on the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic is increasing at a speed comparable to that of all countries.
It goes without saying that it's a step in the process of countries, a variation in the response to public health, and a possible difference in the definition of a case between the country and the protocol to choose a patient to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes the testing of solutions.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy explained the situation about 10% COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 admission data at the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and health care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds of intensive care and care of the country per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to the capacity-building of health care, with prevalence estimates of COVID-19 cases treated inap for each EU/EEA and UK countries related to risk >90% exceeded the capacity of intensive care bed, provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of ECDC on COVID-19.
Since so far the case has been established in a particular region in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional services, information on cases and beds intensive care should be provided at the level of Unit Supply Area for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current train in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-COV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent rapid risk assessment, rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approaches are essential to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the approach to mitigating approaches, because an increase in the number of fast cases, as anticipated, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if that does not apply before.
The rapid risk assessment also sets out the social health steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short chance window available when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health care system may face a patient’s surge that requires intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster to humans.
Similar to the homologous virus SARS-COV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower level of mortality and severity than SARS, but more contagious and more about age than young people, as well as more on men than women.
In response to a rapid increase in the number of publications about this new disease, this article attempts to provide timely and comprehensive reviews of the subject of rapid research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Summer Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all the Tionghoa people who are ordered to stay at home for the holidays and a few weeks after that because of the new virus disease.
This virus is very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease caused by it was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics started in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread across the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has led to 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "enemy of number 1" and potentially destroys more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 establishing a virus that is isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to build research into this rapidly growing new subject.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-related diseases, namely Middle Eastern breathing syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and disease prognosis and some other unanswered but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered nonlethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, each causing the outbreak of the outbreak in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
So, now, COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, an unknown cluster of pneumonia was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, health care infections were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, the area quarantine was treated in Wuhan and the entire public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan marine food market that was considered the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague an emergency in global health.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world (Gbr. 2).
Because situations develop very rapidly, the final coverage and plagues still need to be established.
On 11 February 2020, multi-centre studies on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated epidemic picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people over the age of 50, only a few under the age of 20, and only 14 infected persons under the age of 10.
SARS-COV-2 is more infecting men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the awitian to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from awitian to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected rose exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to the time of mass transportation before the Summer Festival in Tyeongkok.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality of all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are the gender type, age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large clustered subfamily virus that contains a single RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-coV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonsils or spikes (S) are bonded to their cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzyme exchangers and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptidyls each for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The gene RNA virus is released into the siteplasma; after replication of the gene virus, the genome RNA is accompanied by the glycoprotein capule and the nucleopapsid protein form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first generic sequence SARS-COV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new-type beta-COV with a genetic similarity of over 99.98% among 10 consecutive samples; the sample is taken from the site of the outbreak, the Juanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through electron transmission microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium section of very thin human breaths.
ACE2 humans were found to be receptors for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, S SARS-COV-2 protein binds to ACE2 humans weaker than to S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes infections that do not separate SARS-COV infection to patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short protein encoded with orf3b and protein secreted with orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of viruses and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known pattern.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported complete human cryo-EM structure ACE2 in resolution 2.9 and in complex with the transporter of B0AT1 amino acid.
They found that complex, which has open and closed behaviour, is set up to form dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug suppression to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
The original and the middle
SARS-COV and the known MERS-COV are derived from bats and each is transmitted to humans through musks and camels.
By comparing the phylogenetic SARS-COV-2 to the other CoV, bats are considered as the original SARS-COV-2 inang because this new virus is 96% identical with two similar CoV-SARS of bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermittent swimming that helps the virus cross species’ barriers to infecting humans is not yet known, and the transmission route has yet to be explained.
Ji, et al. propose snakes as carriers of bats to humans that involve homologous recombination within S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggest that schilling, mammals are long eating ants that are often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potential to swim between SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homologies on CoV found in scaffolding and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference throughout the genome is still a great difference; hence, the result is conclusive as concrete evidence that has not yet been obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physical chemistry of SARS-COV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and moisture 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar character.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat rays at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfection containing chlorine, acidate, chloroform, and other fat pellets, but not chlorhexidine, effective to deactivate the virus.
Generally speaking, the entire human population has no immunity from SARS-COV-2 and therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on immunological responses to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV research before, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Gbr. 4.4).
Generally, after invading the inang, the virus is known by the underlying immune system through the pattern receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses induce inflammatory expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that restrict the spread of viruses and accelerate antigen virus phagositosis by macrophages.
However, N protein in SARS-COV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in the battle against this virus.
Lymphosite T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
Help T-cells make sitekin proinflammators to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can hinder T-cell function by inducing apoptosis T-cell.
Humoral immunity, which includes a complex, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating viral infections.
For example, antibodies that are isolated from patients who have cured are neutralizing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenarios, failure of mammoth organs and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, marked by the awitan cluster, is more about age with the disease of parturition and pregnant women.
Usually, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune functions are disturbed have opportunities that are infected higher than others.
Estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, shows that the period of incubation 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day based on demographics 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are infected or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended for 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, breathlessness, muscle pain, membranes, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the awitan disease.
In severe cases, patient disease develops rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who suffer from fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without lung imaging, should be covered against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that the percentage of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% for patients require fan support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family groups and clusters that cause the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
In comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that patients MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat disease (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%), reported as major symptoms and ventilation support required for about 14%-20% patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 mortality is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In contrast, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the confirmed 8,096 cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality is 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-COV-2 reached 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-COV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
Those figures indicate that SARS-COV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but not even deactivate MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV pandemic.
Christmas clastera is often found in one family or from a group or a vehicle like a yacht.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the morning.
However, it is reported that a person can carry a virus without showing a symptom of more than two weeks and a patient returned from the hospital can bring another virus, which leads to caution in increasing quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have a periferous white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes) or decreases.
For example, lymphopenia with the count of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the count of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and the aminotransferase aspartate and increased viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood flow rate increased in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer levels increase, that is, the product of fibrin depletion in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Photothoraks flaws were found in the huge COVID-19 patient and marked with a bilateral cloud shadow or the ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbates the gas exchange disturbance.
Pneumocyte dysfunction type I and type II lowers surface levels and increases surface pressure to lower lung capacity to develop and increase risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst finding in the thoracic photos is often parallel with the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumositis desquamation, hyalin membrane formation, and interstisial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as sensitial cells in patients' lungs who died of this disease, according to the pathology of virus and ARDS infections and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-COV-2 RNA detection through a back transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of its false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of medical records, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is vital and a necessity for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang group explained the technical use protocol SHERLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a valve within less than one hour without requiring a complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified in a clinical sample.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors mainly offer supportive care to patients COVID-19, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients who have been cured, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a cured patient is proposed for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical companies compete to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacked the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, breathing function and failure is a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is vital for easing symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease severity.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by oxygenation of the Extracorporeum membrane (ECMO), which is a short thermodified cardiopulmoner technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions result in a site-based storm in SARS and MERS patients.
The sitekin storm is a systemic inflammatory response form marked by the release of the sitekin series, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that become the main cause of ARDS and fail to mastic organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in managing a sitokin storm, especially in severe patients.
Kortikosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to handle web storms.
Other immunosuppression handling for sitokin storms includes modulation of immune responses directed to T cells; transfer of IFN-Δ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; signalling of sitokin 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is often used in SARS treatment to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, high - dose steroids are useless to severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in heavy side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which greatly influence prognosis.
However, short corticosteroids give at low doses until being advised to be given carefully to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous redesivir, an analogue of nucleotide, was found to be active in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, once again for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of another single-united RNA virus, which includes the MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for Tiongkok to perform a series of trials on infected SARS-COV-2, and results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs that patients use should be monitored closely.
Plasma of patients who have recovered and made antibodies
There is a long history of the collection of blood patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent the disease from being cured.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high antibody level in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphositis to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecule on pathogens, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to submit the method for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma - related deficiencies should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune responses and cause sitekin release syndrome, which is potentially life threatening toxicity.
Antibodies in blood are usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to treat critical patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight global epidemics is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that signal effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on the combination of different components in the formula. This formula depends on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because they are difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Right now, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 are not yet available, CCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms to date or for people who are recovering from heavy illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are available for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest degree of recovery in patient therapy COVID-19 observed in some TCM province in 87% of TCM, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest level of healing (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends published a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) alone with the combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it takes for the recovery of body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the inap treatment is much shorter on the WM+TCM group than on the WM group alone.
What's more impressive, the rate of symptom (light to weight) poisoning is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared with the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of the TCM still await better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to describe the working mechanism and clarify the effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very afraid of a highly contagious and even lethal disease, and people with quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects therapy such as insomnia due to corticoid can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early stages of SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Tracking the history of contact and quarantine, as part of the community's health response to COVID-19 disease, can make people feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, expected people, and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general society in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidiscipliner mental health team, clear communication with a routine and accurate update of SARS-CoV-2 disease, and plans for therapy and the use of professional devices and electronics to avoid close contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is essential to break the transmission chain from the animal and human reservoirs infected by vulnerable angels and often is a complement to antivirus therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines, which are long-term and effective in creating penetration and/or immune antibodies that protect against SARS-COV.
For SARS, live-combat vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, the in vivo effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in age and model lethal challenges and its protection against zoonotic virus infections must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
It's probably because SARS decreased 17 years ago and there's no new case reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic case and the MERS cluster continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of vaccines against safe and effective SARS-COV-2 for non-imune people is a very urgent and important task of controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to cope with because it is a long time to develop vaccines (over 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical travel to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without a sequel.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognostic models is vital for the health care system to prioritize its services, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with the patient prognosis COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in studies of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have an increased participation and complications and significantly older patients than patients who do not require intensive care (meaning 66 years over 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: SARS-COV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 over 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidities and complications: A COVID-19 patient who needs intensive care is more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events also undermine the primary cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 reported can also bind to colangiosis with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart failure in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are highly interrelated and can influence one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue damage and is suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP's levels and the ravages and COVID-19's prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Photo of thoraks and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict final results and COVID-19 complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are a widely used immunosuppression as support therapy for infection to reduce inflammatory damage.
Because high - dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors eventually suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with life - threatening disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term periods in patients with COVID-19.
Mental Pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological picture different from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory channel, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory channel and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other CoV causing pills.
Therefore, in the early stages of or incubation, infected patients can produce large amounts of virus during daily activity, which causes great difficulty in controlling epidemics.
However, SARS-COV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tiongkok, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan and surrounding cities and the surrounding quarantine continue almost all populations with the hope that SARS-COV-2 transmission will be terminated.
Even though this has been very damaging to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has declined, which indicates the slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate that the epidemic will end in March and the decline phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts were not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-COV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian research group reported that SARS-COV-2 was detected in mid-conka taps and patients' throats that had been cured and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the reidentified virus could be a repeat episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, the signs of the promise happen in Tyeongkok, if seen based on the decrease in the number of new cases, which shows that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as well as death.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
It may also, like SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2's weak ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that can be associated with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-COV-2 is very easily transmitted through cough or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with the substance contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the faeces so that it revealed the possibility of a new transmission, that is, the transmission of feses-to-mouth.
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosokomyal infections, which include 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, proper precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health - care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even people who are incidentally in contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series number 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgeon’s shop keeps the spit out of those infected with potential air or attaching it to the surface of the material, where the spitting material can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 (series number 1860-years) mask can protect against virion inhalation with a smaller size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely energize; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because particles can implant even five surgical masks that are stacked into one, health care providers that are directly in contact with patients should wear N95 (series number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear a suitable insulated garment to reduce contact with the virus.
A virus can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus might enter his body through the eyebrow.
Therefore, health - care providers also need to wear eye - opening shields or glasses while working with patients.
For public communities in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for independent quarantine, and avoid contact with potential infected people.
Three feet apart is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a great warning to Tiongk who has strong memories of SARS outbreaks in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus had low levels of spread and the limited reproductive capacity of humans to humans and the prevention and preservation of this disease was not an issue.
This message is very soothing to the public, especially when the whole country is preparing the Festival of the Weeks, so that this critical time has passed to protect the disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The body of disease control in Tiongkok should learn from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from the doctor or officer in authority; (3) more limited to curbing the potential of epidemics at the early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often giving targeted and effective training to raise public awareness about disease epidemics and testing and improving public response systems periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus that began to develop at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread to all of Tiongkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, the COVID-19 disease gives an impression of a repeat SARS disease.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is very important to prevent epidemics and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and death levels are also higher in age than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
A COVID-19 patient transmits viruses even when they have no symptoms, while a SARS patient usually transmits viruses when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to block the COVID-19 spread than a SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-COV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-COV.
The routine RNA assay to check the SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has been healed can also have a positive effect on virus testing.
These findings have greatly increased the risk of viral spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still have to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homologies were found between SARS-COV-2 and two bat-like CoV-SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species to feed the virus from the original swimming, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers number 1 and 2, we can't break the transmission effectively and the plague can retrace at all times.
Although molecular and biochemistry models indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is bonded to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cell and lead to the next pathological change?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does a virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Is this pandemic going to be global pandemics, ending up like SARS, or repeated periodically like flu?
Answers to the above questions and many other statements are vital, but it may take time to find them.
Still, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Zoonotic human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved co-evolutions of the co-functions of the co-induced virus (COV) and its inang, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two known human CoVs (HCOVs) caused mild disease, such as seisma.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCOV infection can greatly damage and threaten the soul.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a re-emerged and startled us with a high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-COV.
HCOV infection is a zoonosis, so understanding of HCOV zoonotic origin will be beneficial to us.
Most HCOV comes from bats, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
The Inang reservoir between some HCOVs is also known.
Animal identification has direct implications for the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of CoV-inang interactions on animals can also give important insights about CoV pathogenesis on humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of the current seven HCOV, focusing on the history of its discovery and zoonotic origin and transmission of its interspecies.
What is important, we compare and contrast the HCOV with the perspective of evolution and genome recombination.
CoV disease epidemics 2019 (COVID-19) are currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of a successful swimsuit and the implications of the evolution of the virus in disease damage are also ignored.
The Corona virus (CoV) is part of the Coronaviridae family, which is composed of a group of secreted RNA viruses, positive indria, and single incommunicado.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobasa in the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is similar to the crown under electron microscope.
According to its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar determination.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-reading sequences (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined, both of which are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bouncing or spike (S), lining or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific completion proteins for certain lineages are also intertwined by CoV progeny.
Based on the difference in the protein sequence, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-coV, beta-coV, gamma-coV, and delta-coV); among the four genes, the beta-coV gene has the most HCOV and is divided further into four lines of descent (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are the sources of most of the alpha-coV and beta-coV genes, while the birds are the main gamma-coV and delta-coV reservoirs.
For thousands of years, CoV has been constantly crossing species barriers and some CoV has become an important pathogen in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-COV.
Five other beta-coVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the virus corona acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus corona central eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing an infection of the low respiratory tract in relatively more patients and has a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestation outside the lung organ.
Strain HCOV-229E the first, B814, isolated from a patient's ingestion in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which have caused the symptoms to heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most destructive epidemics in today’s history, which infects more than 8,000 people with a severe death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused a continuing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-COV-2, is a kaustif agent epidemic of the virus corona 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3,120 people's lives and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCOVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
A lot of evidence supports the origin of all HCOVs from bats. In bats, CoV is well adapted and nonpathogenic, but shows a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created a major medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for Tionkok and the whole world.
Observing HCOV zoonotics provides a working framework for understanding natural history, driving power, and the limiting factor of interspecies displacement.
This study can also drive or facilitate search for reservoir animals, midwayers, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications for prevention of spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCOV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general subject that HCOV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but became pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to the new swimming pool.
We also outlined the HCOV evolution trend that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final outcome of SARS-COV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCOV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from a sedated patient ingus, various CoVs had been isolated from infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last few days, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A brief overview of the history of HCOV in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCOV-229E was first isolated from a patient's respiratory line that had upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was then adapted to be implanted in WI-38 lung lines.
Infected HCOV-229E patients show a seismic symptom, which includes headaches, sneezing, sneezing, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough that is seen in 10~20% cases.
In 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial pathways in the narrow brain that are still feeding.
The clinical picture of HCOV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to that caused by HCOV-229E, which can barely be distinguished by the pathogen infection of other respiratory channels such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are most likely to be transmitted during the winter in the surrounding climate.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by pain for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E have had a slight sequencing.
Only a few patients with a weak immune system that shows an infection of low respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first HCOV pandemic documented well in human history and its etiological agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
SARS epidemics led to 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
Despite the supersede, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with four to seven days incubation and the top of the virus load on the tenth day of the disease.
Infected SARS-CoV patients first experienced myalgia, headache, fever, vomiting, and shivering, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory disorders as further symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and kinase creatine enhancement is a common laboratory disorder in SARS.
The damage to alveolar diffusion, the proliferation of epithel cells, and the increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney can also be infected in a severe case, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can be lethal, especially in patients with weak immune status.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of zero-patient relatives traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been dedicated to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 is isolated from the seven-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially very common to young, elderly, and helpless patients who suffered from respiratory diseases.
Drawings of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and common bronchiolitis are found in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from 8-month-old nasal specimens of men who suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and the peak event occurs at the beginning of the summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called krup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated inapt because of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exaserbation.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
The four HCOV communities have all adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases, although this is an extraordinary case for unknown reasons, as in the case of the recently reported subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulent causes an infection of low respiratory tract in Tyeongkok.
Generally, when the ability to move efficiently and to maintain itself within humans, this HCOV virulence and pathogenicity are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient's lung with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, sometimes secondary import cases to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which refers to progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients MERS also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs on MERS among HCOV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-to late December 2019, a patient cluster of retrospective pneumonia was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the disease of the ongoing low respiratory tract infection is caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and names the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death toll of 3.4%.
It needs to be noted, the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections like SARS-COV and MERS-COV with fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Diares were also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of the high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, both clustering into a different phylogenetic tree branch.
SARS-COV-2 pathogonism is clearly lower, but more contagious than with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
The infected subject SARS-COV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-COV-2 around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-COV-2 with six other HCOVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, times of incubation and duration of HCOV disease travel are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed another six HCOV public train.
Second, COVID-19 damage lies between SARS-COV and four other HCOV communities (Yakni HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of community HCOV infection, which includes a picture of mild or even no symptoms of nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, some severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-COV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2's transmission also shows an interesting pattern, a similarity with both HCOV community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2's transmission capacity is at least equal to the community HCOV.
On the other hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after several human pathways still needs to be verified, such as SARS-COV and MERS-CoV.
Last, just like the other HCOV, SARS-COV-2 can be detected from a faeces sample.
"Is SARS-COV-2 transmission fecal-oral important, as in the case of SARS-COV transmission, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonally like the HCOV community case.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the transmission capacity, pathogenicity, and continuous spread across some pathways in humans, would have a powerful effect on the fate of the ongoing end of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCOV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be a species of ancient HCOV instigator.
HCOVs that cause heavy disease in humans and humans who suffer from heavy HCOV diseases have disappeared.
In order for this to happen, HCOV has to replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to be used against the factors of water suppression.
Thus, the longer SARS-COV-2 disease survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood of this virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four community CoVs have flown into the human population and triggered a sequencing on people who are immunocompetent.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV are highly pathogenicly unadapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
Both have to defend themselves and engage in breeding in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more mid-ranges and amplifications.
SARS-COV-2 has a similar image to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-COV-2 is very easily transmitted like HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV community and is not a SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV pathogenic.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully with humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal or an intermediary.
Before discussing HCOV animals, we need to discuss definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as an evolutionary innate HCOV if they have close relatives and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and is nonpathogenic in this swimmer.
Similarly, the water of the reservoir carries HCOV on a continuous and long - term basis.
In these two cases, the swim is naturally infected and is a natural swimmer for HCOV or a mother virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the midlife ring just before or about the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not been adapted to the new and often is pathogenic.
The midlife can function as a source of zoonotic human infection and act as an amplification vessel by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to enhance the scale of human infection.
HCOV may have a dead end infection if it cannot maintain transmission in the middle of the wave.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to the midwives and even cause long - term endemics.
In this case, the midwives become the natural reservoirs.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that the zero SARS case has a history of contact with predators.
The subsequent study of seroprevalence indicates that the animal seller has a higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the general population.
The Moon Musang (Paguma larvata) and larvata dogs in the live animal market are the first identified to carry similar SARS-COV viruses that are almost identical with SARS-COV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the musks on the market were killed.
In spite of this, it is reported that the moon moss of the wild or the unscathed farm in the living animal market mostly produces negative testing for SARS-COV, which means that the moon moss may only act as an intermediate amplification vessel, but not a natural SARS-COV resource.
It needs to be noted, because 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, cannot be sidelined that many small mammal species may also function as an amplification vessel between SARS-CoV.
All these birds seem to be the final ones of SARS-COV.
The search for a natural animal for the next SARS-CoV reveals a close-up bat CoV, known as the Rhinolopus bat-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the bat of the Tiongkok horse.
This bat gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This coV and the other coV bat share the nucleotide-sequent homologies 88-92% with SARS-COV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are the angels for new human pathogens.
Some similar CoV-SARS (SL-COV) is also identified by bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from samples of bat strips is shown using bat ACE2, musk, and human as a receptor to enter the cell.
What's interesting is that patients' sars convalesen serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest kinsman to SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the height of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-COV and bat not a direct SARS-COV inang reservoir.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same water receptor, namely peptide 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends on the RNA MERS-CoV phylogenetically closer to its beta-coV bat identification from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living MERS-COV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-COV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87% of nucleotide-sequent homologies.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct Mers-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that the Arab camel gives positive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like the Middle East camel in some African countries.
MERS-CoV is an identical living virus that is found in humans is isolated from the rubble of the Arab camel, which indicates further that the camel is the actual inang reservoir for the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that the entire massive virus with symptoms that are usually mildly observed in an experimental camel infected with MERS-COV.
It needs to be recorded, camels infected with the entire virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the entire virus of bats.
However, the question is still unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the warning of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homologies with RATG13 bat CoV that are isolated from Rhinolophus finis bats.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 is too large to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be the direct SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, unless almost identical coV bats are found in later days.
Probably, the mid-SAR-COV-2 animal is one of the species of wild animals that are sold and killed at the John Sea Food Grosir Market, and many early cases of COVID-19 are linked to this market, which indicates that the transmission of animals is likely to occur.
Some recent studies based on a metagenomic sequence show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as trengiling (Javanica Manis), may also bring beta-coV ancestors related to SARS-COV-2.
The new trengiling CoV genome shares 85-92% of the nucleotide-sequent homologies with SARS-COV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to the RATG13 with the ratio of 90% to the nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two subgaris-derived viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of the most similar areas of receptor binding (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of amino acid of 97.4%.
What's striking, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 is even more different, although the same level of homology is the same as the whole genome.
Previous study of the diseased trenchling also reported contiguous viral detection of lung samples, which also appeared to be related to SARS-COV-2.
This study adopted a different method of grafting and manual curation to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% complete virus genomes.
We can't sidetrack the possibility of trengiling as one of the inter SARS-CoV-2's pet swimmers.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 is directly from treggling due to the consequent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 dating.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2.
Evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 path in bats, trengiling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest secondary homologies in RBD were found between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 trengiling, SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 share the highest homologous levels in the whole genome sequence.
It's too speculative to say that the level of similarity between beta-CoV RBD relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenchling and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the selective convergence evolution of the mediated.
Hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenchling and RatG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a factor of the evolution drive, recombination occurs many times between beta-coV.
Researchers still can't decide on the origin of SARS-COV-2 zoonotics.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotic origin HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 has also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may have come from bat CoV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 stem viruses have been found in rodents.
It is reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the three-coloured North American bat shows close proximity to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoV, named after Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae suspected to be an interweaving.
To make it more clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCOV animals that are known to be summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the interspecies transmission of HCOV in history.
By about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of animal animals to infect humans, the pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of HCOV-229E interspecies transmission is unclear.
The bat's alpha-coV that's related to HCOV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-coV alpaka.
Some evidence supports direct virus transmission from bats to humans.
First of all, humans, not apacas, may be exposed to bats in the long ecological background together.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, bat alpha-coVs that are related to HCOV-229E have various kinds and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coV causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, alkah's chances of getting the alpha-CoV relatives-HCOV-229E from humans cannot be sidelined.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-coV functioned as HCOV-229E gene release, alpaca and arab camel may function as an intermittent bird that transmits viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of transmitting interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of the MERS-CoV of bats is known to identify the early virus and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
Clearly, bats are a rich species of virus for the exchange of genetic fragments of interspecies and interspecies transmission.
Long age, organized colonies, strong social interaction, and strong flying skills, all are conditions that support bats to be the ideal 'virus spread'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been entering the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to a camel that has changed from the midwive to a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and man remains the final ring for the MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the camel's role in the MERS-COV transmission, the trengiling role, if any, in the different SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Especially, beta-coV trengiling is highly pathogenic in trengiling.
Tengiling may be a final ring for beta-COV relatives SARS-COV-2, similar to musks in SARS-COV case.
In future studies, some potential interspecies SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans should be calculated or sidelined.
First, bats could be the inang reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 relatives who are almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecologically long with bats by slaughter or coal mining.
Second, treggling could have been one of the interneutral amplifications for the newly entered SARS-COV-2 kin virus.
Humans get viruses through slaughter and consumption of meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, which include pets, vulnerable to SARS-COV-2.
Antibodies surveillance on pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that interacts well with bats and trengiling.
SARS-COV-2 animal origin search is still ongoing.
Despite various types of animal swimming, three main factors on the side of the virus are also important to make it easier to cross the species barrier.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-beam RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutations can be considered "during" up to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per path, depending on the CoV adaptation phase against the new ring.
CoV has exoribonukleasing corrections, removals that result in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inferibilities.
Interestingly, the analog nucleotide Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunuklease and RNA polymerase dependent on RN.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of the inhalation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoV is not adapted to the swim.
Compared to SARS-COV with a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-COV-2 mutation is actually lower, meaning a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-COV-2 has adapted to another vessel that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-COV-2, this also applies to the MERS-COV that has adapted to the Arab camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic hygienic hygienics will quickly create vaccines and anti-virus agents against SARS-COV-2 become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, so it increases the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoV when conditions fit.
This is supported by a lot of unique open-reading frames and protein functions bound towards the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replications through unique "chosen-salin" mechanisms.
In the swimming that functioned as a mixing vessel, the transformation of camels often occurred during the CoV RNA transcription.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgeneomics can be recombined to form new CoV.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs like bat SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the inang receptor is another major factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-COV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human-coV SARS isolate and musang, SARS-coV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various swims, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, the CoV S protein RBD interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target response of the inhaled antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is 318 to 510 amino acid in S1, which is bonded to human ACE2 and its correceptor as a virus entry.
RBD SARS-COV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, musks, rats, and raccoon dogs, allowing interspecies virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differently between human and musang virus isolates in RBD and 4 of which are located on receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonsil protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acid may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein S units involves the affinity of binding S proteins with ACE2 humans are likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding affinity and S protein SARS-COV-2 10 to 20 times higher than human ACE2 binding affinity and S protein SARS-COV.
What's also important to know is whether there's another co-receptor that might be needed for SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 is also bonding with ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There's a lot of other HCOV receptors, like an aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-terasethylated acid for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after transmission interspecies from the animal's swimming.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of interspecies HCOV transmission is also regulated by other factors of dependence and control of the angels.
The difference between these water proteins between humans and natural water reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV must take over the factors of water dependence and break down the factors of water restriction in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in the field of interaction of these important viruses still need to be identified and identified.
The complete lining of the genome is not sufficient to see the factor of dependence and the limitations of the SARS-CoV-2 by using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be useful.
The rise of the new HCOV: back to the beginning of the plague
The bat CoV diversity gives you a great chance to show up the new HCOV.
In this case, the bat CoV works as a HCOV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also motivates HCOV evolution and functions as two important steps in this process.
For example, leaking or losing new protein receptors potential to dramatically modify the phenotype virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV bat virus was found to contain a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-COV with a characteristic feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotide found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports water diversion.
In addition, SARS-COV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-COV line and gamma-COV, with a large number of smaller breeding areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and some nsp14.
In the same way, the occurrence of recombination between various lines of descent occurred in the Mers-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination has also been observed in other HCOVs where HCOV has been recombined with other CoV animals in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes to the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of viruses from the pressure of the selection, such as by the inhalation immune system.
This example of effect is the complete ORF4 loss in HCOV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While the entire ORF4 can be observed in bat viruses and camels that are related to HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows the single nucleotide lining that results in the movement of the range.
Finally, the new HCOV evolution was also moved by the pressure of the selection in its reservoir.
A mild or undetected symptom when a bat is infected with CoV, which shows an adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems bats adapt well with CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, the deficiency in the activation of the proinflammation response on bats will effectively lower the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells on bats is stressed because of the increased regulation of the natural killer cell restraint NKG2/CD94 and the level of molecular expression complexes histocompatibilities of the primary class I.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can pressure CoV replication and influence exoribonuklease corrections to give the selection pressure for highly pathogenic strains when entering the new flood.
The more pathogenic strain of CoV may also develop through recombination, which leads to the release of proteins or new protein features for the adaptation of the swim.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two days.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the water of the reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering strong immune response.
This is where the secret lies that there is a bearing without symptoms and the cause of a heavy case of human infection.
Heavy symptoms, especially due to excessive immune response and sitekin storms, with increased lung damage if immune response increases.
On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, the immune response has escaped the CoV replication.
The same strategy to determine the connection of immune responses may benefit in anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, interferon type I, at least at the early stage of SARS-COV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may benefit in COVID-19 management.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the general flow of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While bat beta-coVs that share 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV have been found, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV-2.
Although the musks and other animals on the market were found to carry identical viruses with SARS-COV, the direct intervenor for SARS-COV-2 has not been found.
The highly homologous beta-coV with SARS-COV-2 has been found, indicating that trenchling may play a role as one of the midwayer or beta-coV trenchling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was created by either a good man on purpose or unintentionally.
CoV's back into the center of attention because of the recent SARS-COV-2 plague.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCOV on human transmission.
Very much evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are from bats and are transmitted to humans through the interweaving.
Considering that SARS-COV infection comes from contact between human and wet moss in the wet market, perhaps the closure of the wet market and the murder of all musks in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trengiling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, considering the discovery of some closely related beta-coV line trengiling closely with SARS-COV-2.
Nevertheless, truth and mechanism SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through trengiling and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
This camel acts as an important transport tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local society.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all the camels to control the MERS, as done in the wildlife market in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-COV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause the disease.
Some zoonotic CoVs travel in the wild.
Especially, the bat CoV with zoonotic potential is very varied.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in a new CoV that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
Cultures eat wild animals in some places in Tiongkok should be left to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 experiences, better preparation and action plans must be implemented.
Actually, a lot of viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in the natural reservoir until there's an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, humans’ chances of dealing with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Continuing surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural swimming, which will prove beneficial in preventing transmission of animals and future plagues.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonosis of the virus is to keep the distance from the relative ecological reservoir of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 puzzle have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to trenchling, the condition when bats and trenchlings share the long ecology is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, the way humans deal with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays the role of an actual midwive, the mammal’s way of interacting with other species, which includes humans, bats, and trengiling must be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental and surveillance infections have to be done.
Whether bats, trengilings, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or her almost identical parent virus can be identified in its natural swim in the future.
Continuing research in this field will outline the evolutionary SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update diagnostic criteria "expected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published rapid guidance for diagnosis and treatment of new 2019 coronavirus infections (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combating pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are growing based on current research findings and clinical practical experience; hence, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnostic and Control Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of China.
In December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused the disease, which is now formally referred to as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and the virus is named coronavirus heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid guidance and guidance has been published online at Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guide has been very interesting since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on current research findings and clinical practice; hence, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has released a total of seven editions with some contexts have changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced the proposal for a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guidance and becomes valuable references to this pandemic throughout the world.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also required updates based on the Diagnostic and Control Guide for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, it is necessary to combine one of the epidemiological narratives with two clinical manifestations to create comprehensive analysis, or to establish three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or living in and around Wuhan, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the warning; (2) history of contact with the SARS-CoV-2 case (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported within the last 14 days before the warning; (4) history of contact with confirmed cluster case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in the small area, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts show normal lymphocyte count, decreases, or decreases in the early awitan stage.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on one of the expected pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) Real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire virus genome sequence shows high homogeneity for known new coronavir; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or IgG specific-SARS-CoV-2 antibody changes from negative to positive, or titer increases ≥4 fold at the recovery phase above the levels at the acute phase.
We can see that the actual-time nuclear PCR test in a sample of breathing or blood lines added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence added in the seventh).
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to search for optimal nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory channels including blood intake, which enhances the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us to warn patients with a typical symptom and no symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s ally have to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
As a cover, we hope that more evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the "expected case" and "confirmed case" diagnosis, we suggest that we follow and obey the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on a number of occasions as help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death count
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based cases of cure.
Totally 17 dead.
In a online press release, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death involves four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the people who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladeshi Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Father Quader said public transportation would be stopped longer than the planned ones, until next Saturday.
This public transport stop has started since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first incident of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two people who had just returned from Italy and also their wife.
On March 19, the three were cured.
SARS-COV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia experienced its first death related to the coronary virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the infection of the virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of corona are reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which quotes Johns Hopkins University data, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by a virus infection.
Around the world, countries announce stricter measures to hinder the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow’s mayor, extended quarantine to May 1.
Nationalally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament took a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes supported, ten abstain votes, and one voice rejected.
Saudi Arabia extended the hours of the night in the holy city Mecca and Madinah until all day long; before, it was only between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand plans to apply the nighttime between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.

Shops in Australia lower the purchase limits of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles stores each lowered the limits of the purchase of toilet tissue to two and one pack per transaction at all shops at the national level.
ALDI also applies the one sir's limit, on Monday.
This was announced as a message in the cashier and on the Facebook page of his network.
The buyers were reportedly gathering supplies due to fear of COVID-19 if the public had to do isolation on its own.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricts the purchase of toilet tissue for shipping home to one pack of orders.
This change followed the four-stakeholder restriction per transaction previously applied to Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the limitation of those four packs, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery," and he said that the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sale of the sharp rise last week, according to one of Woolworths' spokespersons.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid misappropriation, Coles ordered more packaging than the buyer and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made provision for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the paper was trying to increase supplies, but the limits of local government agencies for the delivery of trucks made it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while the storekeepers try to meet demands, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early withdrawal of supplies, some stores could not hold special Wednesdays.
In a report News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritual expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills supplies every night.
He stresses that the toilet tissue is a large volume so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of space on the shelf so that the shortages of goods are increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths think that if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet tissue and treatment can [buy] and there's a large amount, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman will go through the ABC News Office.
The production of a back-up toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleinex Toilet fabric, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressured them to work 24/7 to keep supply, reports News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet tissue to the first auction broker in Melbourne, while fewer auctions are held because the buyer takes a break for the long-term holiday weekend of Labor Day.
Thursday's NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, includes eight pages of sides that are meant to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Shops are actually refusing to apply limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, they say that they're not planning on applying the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, treatment, dry food, laundry, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres' toilet tissue to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that COVID-19 disease was occurring—a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very worried about the extent of the preaching and suffering and the degree of fearlessness.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a record published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no virus that has ever been traced from its onset to a continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus said similar views, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of the pandemic followed WHO's decision in January that described this plague as a disillusionment of the world's society.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this outbreak, "the disease is going to get worse."
By Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is a continuation and coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) due to heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a Public Health Distinguished World on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tiongkok, while worldwide it is estimated from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and wheezing.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
Time from date to date is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
No known vaccines or specific antivirus treatment.
The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, shutting your mouth while coughing, keeping your distance from others, and monitoring and self-sustaining for those who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded through travel, quarantine, nighttime, workplace hazard control, and closure.
This pandemic has caused severe global economic social disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the extent of the supply gap that has been severed by the purchase of panic.
Schools and universities have been closed both at national and local levels in 193 countries, which affect about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The misinformation on this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with East Asian and Southeast appearances, and people from the area with a significant case of virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decrease.
The health authority in Wuhan, Tiongkok (the capital of Hubei province), reports the cluster case of pneumonia with unknown causes in December 31, 2019 and the investigation carried out early in January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Gresir Market of Juan Sea Food and therefore the virus is suspected to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus that has just been discovered and is related to bats, coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms was then reportedly ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds found had something to do with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimates that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from the Province of Hubei, is likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of the Province of Tibongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below forming 2.4% cases worldwide, and British scientific advisor Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before immunity could be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people tested by COVID-19 and the results of the tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 predicts that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported case.
Initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center concluded that the figure is probably 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who do not recover, time from the onset of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, until 5 February, about 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% of the previous health disorders include cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and the official death count of the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual mortality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official numbers probably do not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in the nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations by factor 4-5 fold.
A female spokesperson for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention admits, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by a non-illegal report on too low counts in the U.S.. Too low estimates often appear in pandemics, such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.
The first death outside the mainland occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By 28 February, beyond the coast, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13th, more than forty countries and territories have reported death on every continent, except Antarctica; in general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the management options, the time from the first outbreak, and the population character such as age, gender, and health as a whole. The death ratio of the cases reflects the number of deaths is divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall death ratio for cases is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In Tiongkok, the death ratio estimate of the case decreased by 17.3% (for people with 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with 1-February 2020).Other admissions include fatalities of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a particular disease, and the fatality of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who died of a particular disease.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the mortality rate of infection for the overall pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit to this estimate is based on the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyses the impact of the CFR assessment.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of this epidemic are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University stated: "Without being controlled, the outbreak usually spreads and then begins to decrease when the disease is running out of available water.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time about when it will happen."
Senior government medical advisor Thongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, probably up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical limitations and other steps will be necessary "so that vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's very easily transmitted, could disappear entirely" and this disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The repeat virulence will depend on the immunity of the group and the level of mutation.
The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecified and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), the loss of smell, assemblage, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhoea, or hanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has a difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) contains emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, severe chest or chest pain settles, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and bouts on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms occur. Further disease development can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, suksy, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with the results that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are in close contact with those who are confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate an asymptomatic ratio of some to 44%.
The period of incubation (the time between infection and emorrhage) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost breast-feeding at the beginning of 30%, then dropped to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The COVID-19 ministry is believed primarily to occur at close contact time and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that unsealed cough can cause a droplet to be pushed 4.5 feet (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when speaking. A breath droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or nose of someone close to it or maybe be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP), can cause the secret of breathing to turn into aerosols and spread through the air.
The ministry can also happen when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the cracks, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the warning, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the stage of further disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the warning, which means that transmission may occur before a significant symptom occurs.
Only a few asymptomatic reports confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries during the investigation of contacts.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others, and it can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days in plastics (polypropylen) and 304 carbon steel, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature, and pets and other animals have been tested positively COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Koronavirus acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the cluster acute respiratory disease case in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-COV-2 virus characteristics are related to the coronavirus in the natural world, outside of the human body, it can be destroyed if it's exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope, SARS-COV-2 is closely connected to the early SARS-COV.
The virus is expected to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the genetically-clasterated coronavirus with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B-seed) together with the two gallus of bats.
This virus has 96% in the whole genome level with other bats (BatCov RatG13) coronavirus samples.
In February 2020, research found that there was only one difference in amino acid in certain parts of the genome between the Tengthiling virus and the human virus.
Up to now, the comparison of the entire genome found most is 92% of the genetic similarity between the coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, not enough to prove that the schilling is the angel between SARS-COV-2.
Virus infections can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmations are ultimately made by the reaction of the polymerase back transcription chain (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or CT imaging.
A study that compares PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a lot of imaging features that tend to be mixed with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-COV-2, which was first released on January 17.
Tests use polymerase chain reaction transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal taps, but throat taps can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its extensive use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by a certified laboratory.
Characteristics of X-ray imaging and computed tomography (CT) features in people who are symptomatic of the environment include asymmetrical surface glass and no pleura effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international network database for the findings of the confirmed case.
Because it is related to other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tiongkok compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although not specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive and is suggested to be considered as a supplement in the epidemic area.
The neural network of artificial intelligence-based convolution has been developed to detect viral imaging features with X-ray and CT.
The strategy to prevent the transmission of this disease includes keeping good personal cleanliness comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue while coughing or sneezing and directly throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
It is also recommended that the government of the various regions restrict or urge it to stop all non-essential journeys to and from the countries and regions affected by the plague.
However, the virus has reached the level of population spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected, the health care provider who handles people who may be infected is advised to perform standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection, and tracking contact is an important step for the health authority to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy problem, with the release of a statement from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations calling for surveillance restrictions of this kind.
Cellular applications have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of the user's distance to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing your hands was recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after spraying noses, coughs, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged the protective layer.
In addition, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based hand treatment with at least 60% alcohol based on the volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, noses, or mouth before washing hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of laruts (in one minute disinfectant for carbon-resistant steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glukonate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as the office or child care facility, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machine used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows held or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately throw away tissue.
The surgical mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and time range of spiral droplets that are spread while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with hands that are not clean enough, which is the primary source of transmission."Masker also recommended to use those who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. specifically recommended that medical masks be used for healthy people, especially when they are close by (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended surgical masking when using public transportation or living in a large area.
Thailand’s health - care agent encouraged people to make cloth masks at home and wash it every day.
Czech Republic and Slovakia forbid its people from going out in public without wearing masks or covering noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the towel to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, obliges train passengers and intercity buses to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time out of the house, as well as recommending the manufacture of facial masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
The face mask is also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restraint (also referred to as physical restraint) is an infection control action that is meant to slow disease spread by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restraint methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restraint by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding large areas, using uncontacted greetings, and keeping the physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or seek social restrictions in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered who were recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations quickly reduced, from 250 people (if unknown as COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Older people and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and an immune system that is at risk of serious disease and higher complications are suggested by the CDC for as long as possible in areas where there is a disease at the level of society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health services began to replace the use of the term "social restraint" as "physical limitations", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relationships, either virtual or from a distance.
The use of the term "social restraint" suggests that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes an incentive to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Isolation alone at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Indeed, many governments have forced or recommended quarantines for the entire population who live in the affected area.
The strictest independent quarantine instruction is issued for people who are high-risk groups.
A person who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and recently traveled to the country or region with a wide spread of COVID-19 is advised to do quarantine independently for 14 days since the last possible date.
Strategy in the control of the plague is restraint or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Detention is done at the early stage of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infections and vaccines aimed at stopping the spread of disease throughout the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, the next attempt is to shift to the level of mitigation: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and society.
The combination of restraining actions and mitigating can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.The purpose of managing infectious disease outbreaks is to try to lower the peak of epidemics, which are known as the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of inadequate health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonfarmasi intervention to deal with the disease involves the prevention of individual actions, such as hand-cleaning, wearing face masks, and independent quarantine; the steps at the level of society aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and canceling mass meeting events; the involvement of the public to encourage reception and participation in this kind of intervention; and the steps at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning; and the other drastic actions intended to prevent the outbreak of the outbreaks being carried out in Tiongk as the outbreaks of the outbreaks become more real, such as the tyrannical of the entire city and the conduct of strict travel bans.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces mass massages and local quarantines, and warns of the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do quarantine and wear huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punishes medical supplies. Simulations for England and the United States show that mitigating (slow, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimal mitigating policies can reduce the peak of demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and inadequate health systems.
Depression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained while the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), because if not, the transmission will jump back quickly when the suppression steps are slowed down.
Long-term intervention to pressure pandemics has an impact on social and economics.
No specific anti-virus drugs were approved for COVID-19, but development efforts were under way, including existing drug testing.
Taking free - selling flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can make the patient worse.
Some of the compounds previously approved for treatment of another virus disease are being studied to treat COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home-based treatment" can ease symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of patients COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the disease.
ECDC and the regional WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, if it is possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive patients COVID-19, and improve the capacity of intensive care by training personnel and increasing the number of fans and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In a month, the number of coronary cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Gresir Market of the Sea of John, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals, or, in other words, has zoonotic origin, a cluster of pneumonia with unknown causes observed on December 26th and handled by Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Hospital, which told CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about the "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by their superiors for warning.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued a public announcement on December 31st and told WHO.
Quite a lot of unknown pneumonia cases were reported to the health authority in Wuhan that then triggered an investigation early in January, and at the early stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spreads to other Provinces, supported by migration during the New Illek Year and because Wuhan is the transportation center and main railway transit site.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States has exceeded the Chinese and Italian levels of confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died in the world and over 364,000 have been cured.

Public announcements issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was told the same day.
When this notification was carried out, a doctor in Wuhan was warned by the police because of "preaching the rumors" about the plague.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of the transmission of humans to humans.
At the end of January, the government launched a radical campaign that was then explained by the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to defend the spread of the virus.
In quarantine called "the greatest quarantine in human history", health cordon or cleaning barrier was announced on January 23 to stop the way in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, which affected a total of 57 million people.

The flight schedules are also affected and modified. South Korea introduces programs that are considered the largest and most organized program in the world to suppress viruses in the population, isolate each infected person, and track and maintain contact with them.
The methods of coating include reporting symptoms independently by new people from abroad through cellular applications, resurgence or drive-thru tests with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to over 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's program is considered successful in controlling the disease even though it doesn't predate the entire city, and at first, the view of South Korea's people is shared about the response of President Moon Jae-in to this crisis.

On the other hand, Tiongkok's assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa, and on April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
WHO commends the efforts of the government of Tiongkok in managing and building epidemics.
WHO noted the difference between SARS outbreaks in 2002-2004 when the Tiongkok authority was accused of closing down so as to hinder the prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving a routine update to avoid panic approaching the New Year's Eve."
On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to apply the ban on transportation in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea said that although it was "clearly not recommended by WHO," but it was also "a very important indication for committing epidemics in the most concentrated place of the disease" and he called it "never happened before in the history of society's health."On January 30, after the confirmation of human transmission to people outside of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared this outbreak as World-Realigned Public Health (PHEIC), the PHEIC sixth since that step was first treated during the 2009 Babylonian flu pandemic.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom says that PHEIC is declared "the risk of global spread, especially to low and middle-income countries that do not yet have a complex health system.
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take steps to disrupt international travel and trade unnecessarily" and "WHO does not recommend trade and movement restrictions."

In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health-care program, warned that, "It's time every government on this planet faces reality: stay awake.
This virus may come to your place and you have to be ready," and insists that the right step can help the world avoid "the worst."
Further, Ryan states that the current data does not allow the public health official to declare a global pandemic, and says that such statements mean " basically we accept that every human on this planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus disease a pandemic.
Director General WHO said that WHO "very concerned about the level of spread and the distress, as well as the level of fearlessness, and the level of the action that worries us." WHO accepts the harsh criticism of the inadequate judgment of handling pandemics, which includes delay in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as pandemics.

The Tiongkok government receives criticism from the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, for the early management of the pandemic in Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
A number of provincial administrators of the Communist Party Tiongkok (CPC) have been discontinued in connection with quarantine management in the Central East, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political response of the institution in dealing with the epidemics in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to the disease of coronavirus.
Some Tiongkok officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the earlier admission of the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 from the United States or Italy.
The U.S. government of Donald Trump calls coronavirus "Tingkok virus" or "Whan virus" and says that "Tingkok action that closes the lid gives power to the virus that is now turned into a global pandemic."
The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that outlined the communication strategy and clearly came from the National Security Council, with a strategy quoted as "All about Tiongkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including a press conference and a TV show."Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that the attempt to send aid to the affected countries was part of the campaign to influence the world.
The Head of Foreign Policy of the European Union Josep Borrell warned that there was "geo-political groups, which included fighting to gain influence through the reversal of the fact and 'political generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "Things aggressively push messages that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners."
Thiongkok also called for the US to revoke the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and to send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation is 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

In addition, Turkey took hundreds of fans intended for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, which had an impact on the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only the Chinese respond bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin directed the Russian army to send medical forces, vehicles with special disinfection, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" which says that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or of little use for Italy."
The source accuses Russia of a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Foreign Minister Luigi in May ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
The Russians also sent cargo planes with medical aid to the United States.
The Kremlin Dmitry Peskov spokesperson said that "when offering help to fellow Americans in the United States, [Putin] assume that if U.S. equipment and medical equipment producers get a chance, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war drill since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General for the Campaign Kate Hudson's Nuclear Weapon fighting criticizes the Defence 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of the US and many participating European countries, but also the people of the country where they operate."The Iranian rule is heavily affected by this virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected with five political figures today or before.
On March 14, 2020, President Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country was struggling to fight the plague because of its lack of access to the international market as a result of the United States' sanctions against Iran. This plague has prompted the United States to adopt a common social policy in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher funding for the health of society.
Political analysts suspected it could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 election of President, and diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are deteriorating due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticises the "ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that everyone who comes from South Korea will be placed in quarantine two weeks at the government's designated location.
At first, a shared view of the South Korean society is related to President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans have signed a petition, either calling for Moon's conviction, on the basis of their claims about the government's misdemeanours in dealing with the plague, or praising its response.
Some commentators express concern that it can enable the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule through timeless decrees, to delay parliament and the public elections, and to punish people who are believed to spread false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus outbreaks are due to lack of supply, which stems from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the plague, the purchase due to panic, and the disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Supervisory Body warns about the lack of drugs and medical equipment because of increasing consumer demands and disruptions.
Some areas also suffer from panic resulting in a lack of basic needs, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, which triggers a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to general director WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for safety devices increases by 100 times.
The demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also causes a lack of self - protection around the world, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, pandemics provide a new opportunity for customs buyers to sell Australia’s products in Taiwan.
This has led to a lack of milk in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products, these two areas are avoided by lack of food.
Steps by Tyeongkok and Italy in fighting against the enrichment and illegal trade of important products succeed so that the anticipated lack of acute food will occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet experienced a significant decline, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
The empty food racks were found only temporarily, even in Wuhan City, along with the government officials of the Tingkok to remove pork stocks to ensure that the population's diet was adequate.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep backups for such an emergency.
The global economic decline has been felt in China: according to the media report on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 by the government's steps to curb the spread of the virus, and the sale of an allotment of 20.5%.
Because Tiongkok is a major economic center and manufacture, the virus epidemic is estimated to pose a major threat of destabilization of the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will continue to fluctuate until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemics on global growth could exceed the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004.
An estimate from Washington University at St. Louis states that the plague has impacted more than $300 billion on the global supply chain, which can last for up to two years.
The Earth's Oil Exporter Organization (OPEC) reported "pokers" after the price of oil suffered a sharp decline due to the reduced demand from Tiongkok.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside the land.
On 27 February, as concerns about coronavirus outbreaks increased, various U.S. stock indexes, which include NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, noted the sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the one-day decline largest since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed Tiongkok government credit rating, but maintained Outlook Negative.
Stocks are further caused by anxiety about the coronavirus, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people think that economic recession may occur.
Econom Mohamed El-Erian praised the urgent step of central banks and the state of the state that was right on time.
Central banks react faster than they did at the time of the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severe sectors affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including places of tourism, and government actions that limit travel worldwide.
As a result, many companies cancel out flights because of few requests, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is on levels that have never been seen before.
Several railway and ferry stations have also been closed.
Epidemics coincided with Chunyun, the main travel season related to the New Irish New Year's Eve.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by central and regional governments, including New Irish New Year's Festival, and private companies also separately closed shops and tourist venues, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Irish New Year's events and tourist sites were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the forbidden city of Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 out of 31 provinces, the city of Madya, and the territory of Tiongkok, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until 10 February and ordered most jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the incidence of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency, closed school until March, and canceled New Year's celebration.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle East leaders experienced 50–60% decline.
This also led to a decline in 33-43% of traffic on foot to the shopping mall in March compared to February.
The world-wide shopping center operator is taking extra steps, such as the increase in health, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and the cancellation of events.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus outbreaks could cause 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment levels to reach 32%. The region’s quarantine in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages) to retire. Angus Reid Institute’s survey found that 44% of Canadian households have been unemployed. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the treatment of quarantine in the region in the mid-March 2020.
During the two-month period of March, as many as 4 million French workers filed a temporary unemployment allowance and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme, and almost half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term work plans to their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the arts and cultural heritage sector is greatly influenced by pandemics, which affect the functioning of organizations and individuals, both employed and self - involved.
The arts and culture organizations strive to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to provide cultural heritage to the public, to safeguard the safety of employees and the public, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, entertainment venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The impact of another recent and very fast-growing disease is the cessation of religious services, large sports, and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technological conferences, and dressmaking.
The film industry was also disturbed, and the Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the early Christian era of repentance, was cancelled.
Many confessions encourage the elderly to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, live broadcast or television, while others offer drive-in or wake-up worship.
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic diocese and the release of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancel the service and restrict public meetings in the church, the mosque, the synagogue, the temples, and the gurdwara.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Mass Friday in areas affected by plagues and places of worship then closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to holy places at Mecca and Madinah.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events are cancelled or postponed, including UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA 2019-2020, and NHL 2019-2020.
This outbreak disrupts the 2020 Winter Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympics Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than the summer 2021."In the whole world, casinos and other places of play are closed and live poker tournament broadcasts are either delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites to report significant new registration upgrades, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling the concert tour.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway are also delaying all the shows.
Artists explore various ways of continuing to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative for a traditional live show, such as live online concert or making web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many Internet memorabilia have been published online by the masses of people who switch to humor and distract in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the children of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports of February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Tiongkok) recorded racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa deserved to receive the virus or receive what they claim as a reward.
Some countries in Africa have also increased anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people report discrimination because of their region’s origin.
There's already been support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the affected areas of the virus.
Following the outbreak of the new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first in Europe who experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. People in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first signed a petition to prevent the people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan tagar became a Twitter train.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported increasing levels of racial abuse and assault.
The president of the U.S. Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Tingkok Virus", a term that critics considered racist and anti-Tingkok.
The sense-finders in Ukraine attacked the buses that brought Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East Sea India, bordering with Tiongkok, and studying in large cities of India are reported to have suffered from the disease of coronary disease.
President Bharatiya Janata State unit in Western Bangladesh Dilip Ghosh states that Tiongk has destroyed nature and "that is why God avenges them."
The statement was later threatened by the Consulate Tiongkok in Kolkata, calling it "misleading", in Tiongkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa's inhabitants engaged in pandemi, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "dealing".
Many newspapers using payline have deleted them for some or all of their coronaviruses.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to epidemics available with open access.
Some scientists choose to quickly share the results on the print server, such as bioRxiv.
New infectious disease – New pathogen infection disease, often new in the range of disease or its transmission method
Globalization and disease - Globalization and disease transmission
List of epidemics and pandemics - List of fatalities for infectious diseases

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the existence of viruses and detect antibodies that are produced as a response to infection.
The existence of viruses in samples confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronary RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-COV-2 virus only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibodies show the number of people who have been infected, including those who are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
An accurate mortality rate and the level of immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of the limited testing, until March 2020, no country has any reliable data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a great variation in the number of tests carried out by countries.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported fatality rate, which is probably too high in some countries.
Using the real-time transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat straps can only be trusted in the first week of the disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested on the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep ventilating channel by using the sucker catheter or the material released through the cough (sputum).
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Britain also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-COV-2 detection device (PowerCheck Coronavirus) that was a client-friendly on January 28, 2020.
This device searches for "E" genes that have all beta-coronavirus, and RdRp genes that are specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies to accept the emergency use of the Tionkok National Medical Product Administration for the PCR-COV-2 SARS detection device. In the United States, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory through the International Resource Reagent.
One of three genetic tests in the old version test yield unconvincing results due to reactional errors, and the number of CDC tests in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and shortly thereafter the state labs and local laboratories were allowed to perform tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Supervisory Board based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation. The U.S. Trade Laboratory began testing early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing was available based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no quantity limits announced; the collection and processing of specimens must be carried out according to the CDC requirement.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a 3.5-hour high-volume test so that a machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted US authorization to Abbott Laboratories for testing the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hollogic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests using non-PCR isothermal nuclear amplification technology.
Because there is no need for a series of changing temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind new nucleopapsid (N-protein) proteins are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that they can produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photo thoraks have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as CT's [computed tomography] findings may already exist before the awitgan symptoms."
Special features in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distributions.
Subpleura domination, cry paving, and consolidation formed as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the point of origin of the present pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a large number of mild imaging features lined with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."On March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for early coating.
Part of the immune response to infection is the development of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after the onset of a warning, to determine immunity from disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be performed in the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The high-performance automatic system in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, a periferous blood specimen obtained through a skin bite is usually used.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to the check. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notification to agencies as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their testing devices that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The ability to test up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing against RNA viruses.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the weekly infection.
Hong Kong draws up a scheme to allow the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will give specimen tubes to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results some time later. The English NHS announces that NHS is pioneering the expected case-test scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of the patient reaching someone else if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect the ambulance if used. In the survey of the anticipated COVID-19 case, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate preventive action.
On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had the capacity of some 12,000 tests per day in the road care system and 10,700 tests were carried out the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, the electorate test was offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including week 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital develop and test methods to test samples of 64 patients at the same time, by combining samples and only further testing if the samples were found positive. In Wuhan, the 2,000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (the Mandarin language: , or "Firemate" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples daily.
With its construction monitored by the founder BGI Wang Jian and taking five days, the modeling shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the associated cost for quarantine management can double if this test capacity does not exist.
The Wuhan Laboratory was soon followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout the city of Tiongkok.
On March 4, 2020, total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. Multiplex open source designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid supply.
Until March, the shortage and insufficient amount of reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers are trying to explore sample sampling protocols involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirates was reported to do more coronavirus testing per capita population than any country, and ready to increase the scale of testing to reach most populations.
This is achieved through the combination of surveying and the purchase of mass-scale laboratory results from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of Tyeongkok.
A number of screening recipes targeting various parts of the Coronavirus genetic profile were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of testing devices that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Center was not available until 28 January to slow down the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the epidemic, Tiongkok and the United States were having problems with the failure of the testing device; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing tools to meet the request and recommendations of the health expert.
On the other hand, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
The ability to test, mostly in the private sector lab, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the expansion of the testing program to be the best way to slow down the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.
By March 2020, Tiongkok reported a problem of accuracy on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC have "deformed"; the government then eliminates the bureaucratic obstacles that prevent private testing. Spain buys testing tools from the company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the result is not accurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish minister said that they would attract equipment that would not work properly, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tool purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from the Chinese that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test tool be discarded in the Danube River. The Kara Athest of the Turkish Ministry of Health says the Turkish-buying test tool has "high quality" and they don't "use it". English Raya buys 3.5 million test tools from Tiongkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of a positive and tracking person who contacts a positive SARS-COV-2, results in a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of testing on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the tested positives have no symptoms, and all cases found in quarantine.
By limiting travel to this community, the new infection was completely eliminated.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other advanced countries, although without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and restaurants.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on time after the holidays on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics through aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantines that are less aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower fatality rate, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people who had mild symptoms or had no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples COVID-19 first and ten negative samples first to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 were in Europe, 2 were in Africa, 1 were in North America, and 1 were in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "%Result positive testing" is influenced by the policy of the country's testing.
A country that only tests those who are treated in hospitals will have % higher positive results than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factor.
Washing hands, which is also referred to as cleaning hands, is the act of cleaning the hands of someone who aims to eliminate dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently on certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or seisma, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucosal membrane).
Five critical moments throughout a very important day to wash hands with soap are: before and after a large wash, after cleaning the ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or eating meat, fish, or raw oats.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes. World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning the kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand cleaning refers to the practice of cleaning that relates to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical goal of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce infant mortality rates at home.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that handwashing practical growth can slightly increase the growth of children.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children from respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
A handwashing intervention can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - income areas.
48% reduction of diarrhea can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute breathing channels (ISPAs), as an underconscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one child deaths; this disease causes the death of some 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and using toilets into a cultured habit can save more lives than vaccines or medical actions, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea to almost half and death from acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleaning (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The minor side effect of washing hands is the washing of hands that is often done can cause skin damage as a result of drying skin.
A study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive washing of hands can lead to a condition of itching and cystic skin, known as extreme hands or dermatitis, which is especially prevalent among health workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal illness, that is: before and after using toilets, after cleaning asses, before feeding children, before eating and before eating or eating meat, fish, or raw oats.
Another important time to apply the right hand washing technique to prevent the transmission of disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing noses; after touching animal shit or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that the average 38.7% households practiced handwashing with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level of 23 percent. There are now some methodologies for changing behavior to improve the habits of hand washing with soap at critical times. Washing hands group for students at the time specified is one of the options in the developing countries to adapt handwash in children's behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of the right action on a scale to support the health and education of the child.
The donation of worms twice a year, plus washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
This program has also been implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing from the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the fluctuations and increase the power of the latent.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, it is not easy to slow down in water.
However, the cleansing of fat and protein is supported by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, because of its re-use, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfer could not be possible because bacteria are thinned by foam.
Even so, the CDC still states "the liquid soap that comes out of the container without touch of hands is preferred."
Anti-bacterial soap strongly encourages conscious people.
Until now, there is no evidence that antiseptic or disinfection use is recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichosan, which have a wide list of resistant organisms.
So, even though a strain that holds antibiotics is not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
A comprehensive analysis of the Faculty of Health of the University of Oregon University of Health shows that ordinary soap is as effective as common soap with consumer level antibacterial soaps that contain consumables in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hands.
Warm water that's comfortable to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in eliminating natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria.
However, in contrast with the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand or antiseptic hand care is a waterless cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-cleaning agent was a non-water-based drinker (also known as an alcohol-based handwasher, an antiseptic handwasher, or hand-washing).
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is formulated along with such basic substances as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as gels or with moisture such as glycerin as fluid or foam to be easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide incer enhances antimicrobial activity further, hand care that contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
The fungal alcohol service kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol service that contains 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log conversion 3.5, similar to reduction 35 desibles) bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log extension 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minutes after use. The most effective hand care against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand care is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics or alcohol-twisting in a sufficient amount should be used to embalm or cover two hands overall.
The front and back two hands and in the saddles and ends of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to fluid, foam, or dry gel.
The fingertips should also be washed well by scrubbing them on two palms. The US Disease Control and Prevention Center is more likely to recommend handwashing instead of handwashing, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increases the use of the treatment agent due to the ease of use and rapid homicide activity against microorganisms; however, the treatment agent should not be used as a correct handwash replacement, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand treatment can often cause dry skin, unless emolyen and/or skin softener is added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolynia to the formula.
In clinical trials, the use of alcohol - based hands that contain hemoliens causes irritation and skin droughts far lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substance in the handwashing of alcohol rarely occurs.
The lower trend causes the dermatitis of contact that interferes with the attractiveness of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean hands off organic materials, but just disinfect them.
For this reason, cleaners are not as good as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
The honesty of the free hand treatment of alcohol depends heavily on its material and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation using benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have ongoing and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been reduced since repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects.
Many in the low - income community are unable to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Abu or earth may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a deinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline cortex.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique based on the recommendation of the US Disease Control Center for disease prevention includes the following steps:
Hands with warm or cold water flowing.
Water flows are recommended because the silent baskom may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Use your hands to rub it with plenty of soap, including your back, in your fingernails, and under your fingernails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates a wrinkle, which helps eliminate germs from the skin, and rubs longer to eliminate more germs.
Talk exactly under the water.
Sneaking in a bathtub can restore the contaminated hands.
Dry with a dry blanket or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easier to recontaminate, the area that is often crossed is thumbs, wrists, the area between fingers, and under nails.
The forged nails and the missing nail paints can store microorganisms.
Severe lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission infections.
Low-cost options can be made to make it easier to wash hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, e.g., flowing water from the giraffe or bottle hanging and hollowed and/or using ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-heat solutions, such as "typpy-tap", and other low-cost options.
Because the tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hanging with a rope, a lever operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand-holding is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-drying in the public toilet.
The more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study carried out by Westminster University, London, and arranged by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry, to compare the cleaning levels of paper sheets, warm air dryers, and more moderate jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in the finger books and 254% in the palms of the hands.
Gleaning with jet air dryers caused a 42% increase in total bacteria in the fingers and 15% in the palms of hands.
After washing and drying hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palms.
The jet airbender, which sprays air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially polluting other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spreads the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in the study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various hand-drying methods were evaluated.
After drying the hands, the following bacteria have been observed:
There are many hand - driers, and the hand - drier has been compared to the drying by using paper sheets.
Washing hands using the hand weavers is an alternative during travel without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand servicers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was required far after the physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreases with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing is performed for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large amount or gel to fertilize and rub each part of the hand.
Hands have to rub each other with fingers sticking together.
If there's dirt under the nails, the brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water that is in hand, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with clean sheets.
Once dry, paper sheets are used to turn off the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This action avoids hand-to-hand recontamination from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in the health care setting is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("comment") and avoid the transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so as to transmit microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hand and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flow infection related to catheters up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the standards of handwashing and handful movements in the health care sector.
The WHO concept of handcleaning can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate handcleaning if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Five Time" to wash hands:
after exposed to blood/body fluids
before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (a "drug" or "antimicrobe" soap) works to kill the handwashing material.
The killing function may be desired before surgery or in a situation when an antibiotic-resistant organism is very common; to 'clean' hands before the surgery, it is necessary to turn the switch on and off without touching, to wash chlorhexidin or iodium, to dry hands after washing, and to wash sterile scarves and other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry has to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long scrub time (10 minutes) is not required.
When spraying, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgeon’s robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand treatment before and after treating the sick.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of the washing, and that the additional benefit obtained was very little when the hand cleaning frequency was increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the spread of infection to food than washing with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashing to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and spore Clostridium difficult from hand. Intervention to improve the hygiene of hands in healthcare settings can involve education for staff about washing hands, improving the availability of alcohol-based handbrushes, and written reminders and lilies to staff.
More research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps near private toilets or public toilets rarely exist, although options are available to make the laundry cheap.
In any case, low levels of hand washing may also occur because of habits that have been planted and not because of lack of soap or water.
The desire and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and lead to changes in long - term population behavior.
In order to be effective, monitoring and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to increasing handwashing at LMIC, while a less effective social marketing campaign. One example of handwashing at school was "Third Stars Approach" by UNICEF that encouraged the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students washed their hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to the end of the three stars.
Building a laundry can be part of the handwashing campaign to reduce the disease and death of children.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of changing behavior. Due to the 2019-2020 virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages handwashing emoji.
Some studies examine the cost-effectiveness of washing hands globally in developing countries in relation to disability-adjusted life year (DALY) avoidance or the size of a year lost as a result of the disease.
One survey showed that encouraging handwashing with soap significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as new birth mothers or wounded soldiers in the hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care providers" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection is caused by the rotten smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, diseases transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active to encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such contagious diseases.
For example, the poster "technologically wash the right hand" hung next to the wash sink in the public toilet and in the toilets of the offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring a person's refusal to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression came from the Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but it had become a widely used expression in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continually to clean up the imaginary stain; an act that showed her guilt for the crimes she did and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate handwashing equipment.
Further, those who are allowed to wash their hands after that meditation have a smaller profile involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual part of the washing of hands in many religions, including the Faith of Bahá'í, Hindus, and Jewish Jewish Jews, the Lavabos in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam, and the cleansing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions are obliged to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands before and after eating.
Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Controlling workplace hazards for COVID-19 is a methodology of safety and health work for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on workplace location and job, which is based on risk assessment of the sources of exposure, disease severity in society, and the risk factors of each worker that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and other partners; for this work, recommended basic infection prevention steps, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and routinely clean and disinfect the work environment.
Work risk exposure is involving jobs that require close contact or often with unknown or suspected people suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by transmission in the current society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high - volume restaurants.
Risk control for this group, other than the basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air sachets, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection devices when confronted with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and morgue of the known or suspected person to be at high risk of high exposure, which increases the risk of high exposure if workers perform aerosol cost procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, the known or suspected COVID-19.
The appropriate risk control for this worker involves technical control, such as negative pressure ventilating room, and self - protective device that meets the task of work.
COVID-19 disease can have some impact at work.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, either in the type of goods requested or how to obtain these items (like shopping outside the busy hour, through delivery, or lifting).
Finally, shipments from a geographical area that is highly affected by COVID-19 could be disturbed.
The plan considers levels of risk related to various workplaces and jobs, including sources of care, risk factors arising from home and society settings, and risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also describes the control that is needed to address the risk and the emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the disease.
Perceptuality and plans for the spread of disease may be submitted to national or subnational recommendations.
The aim of the outbreak involves reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at greater risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease damage in the community where business is affecting the action taken.
Hirarchy of hazard control is a working space used extensively in safety and health at work to group risk control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, administrative oversight, and the last protective device.
Technical control involves insulating employees from work-related dangers without relying on worker behavior and can be the most costly solution to be applied.
Administrative oversight is a change in policy or procedure that requires action by the worker or the worker.
Self - protection (APD) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but may help prevent some of the biases.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazard to workers, properly installed as they occur (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly worn, checked, cared for, and replaced on a number of occasions, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and kept correctly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - income jobs have minimal contact with the public and other employees.
Steps to prevent basic infections recommended for all workplaces include often washing hands thoroughly, pushing workers to stay at home if the disease, breathing ethics include covering cough and sneezing, providing networks and garbage vessels, preparing jobs from a distance or working shifts with time of arrival/return, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routinely cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
A quick identification and isolation of potentially transmitted individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever-lowering drug or other symptoms-modifying medication, and that sick leave policy be flexible so that they allow employees to stay at home to take care of sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, employment risk exposure is involving jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) of unknown or expected people with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of transmission in the community around the business location, or because someone has just made an international trip to the location with a large COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as school, work environment with high population density, and high-volume rituals settings. Technical controls for this group and high risk groups include installing high efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical obstacles such as sneezing plastic bingeers, and installing non-essential journeys to the location that are experiencing COVID-19 disease, developing an open communication plan for workers, equipping workers with the face-to-face with virtual communication, setting up a meeting with a virtual communication, making work with a time-to-time COVID-19 disease, interrupting non-essential journeys to the location that are undergoing COVID-19 disease, developing an open-to-work communication plan covering forums to respond to workers' concerns, equiping workers with education and updated training on the risk factors COVID-19 and possibly requiring protective treatment, training of workers who need to use their clothing and help to respond to workers' attention, equip workers with their education and training methods of living habits, and helping their neighbors and helping them to observe their work, helping them to work, helping them through work.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers involves separating the sick from others by 6 feet, pointing out one cabin crew to care for the sick, and offering face masks to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear medical gloves once and for all when caring for passengers who are ill or touch the body fluids or surfaces that are potentially contaminated and may have other protective tools if the passengers who are ill suffer from fever, ongoing cough, or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other items should be disposed of in life-threatening bags, and the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected after them; for commercial voyages, including yachts and other passenger ships, danger control includes delaying travel if it is ill, isolating itself, and informing the medical center on the ship immediately if someone suffers from a fever or other symptoms while on the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabins of people who are isolated, except in society, for schools and children's dating facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if infected people have ever been in the school building.
If there is a minimal to-date transmission in society, social restraint strategies can be implemented, including: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, classrooms, or cafeteria meals, increasing the distance between table, arrival time and gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local society, in addition to the social restraint strategy, the extension of school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of direct health risk is considered lower by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who must contact the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same guidelines as the emergency medical technician, including using appropriate protective devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and job equipment before being used back using sprays or household cleaners and follow standard operating procedures to control and remove old APDs and to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers the health and the individual morgue to be at high risk or very high.
Work risk of high exposure includes the provision of health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation that is exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This job is at very high risk if the workers perform aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, coughing procedures, bronkoscopes, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimens.
The work of the high-risk morgue includes workers involved in preparing the body of a known or suspected COVID-19 case at the time of death; this job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform an autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol cost procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
The specimen must be handled with the biological safety level 3 prevention.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are expected to have a COVID-19 case. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those who do aerosol cost procedure.
In the United States, N95 filter face coverings approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive breathing protection programs that include matching tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the workers. WHO does not recommend closed clothing entirely or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through the body fluid.
WHO only recommended a surgical mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
For those taking respiratory specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, a surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the APD supply is not enough worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of APD through long-distance medical services, physical limitations such as visual window openings, with only those involved in direct treatment can enter the room containing the COVID-19 patient, use only the APD required for certain tasks, continue using the same respirator without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and does not encourage the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUBJEK BARIS: [Covid-19] lightens the load and prepares for the future
THE COURT/WHERE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is the thing that makes the global human bond and the responsibility that we have for each other clear.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we've witnessed among all the coworkers through e-mails, calls, and talks is an extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, whom we're lucky enough to work with.
Thank you and my pride are infinitely bound to call you colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, helps pay our partners, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it will make a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to preserve the survival of the organization during this time.
We really want to eliminate pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and somehow you need to care for loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should not have been told, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO not required, enough to let your manager know and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed with positive COVID-19, please tell Bryan in the T&C Ops that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention from management.)
Companions with hours-based pay will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we've said it again, to respect our commitment to fellow contractors and staff based on hours.
All will be paid in line with the average hours they work when circumstances change.
This includes if you get sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to bring stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust and Security, as well as the Fund Building Team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess the current goals and distract our focus from supporting the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning to "work overtime after it's gone" after this pandemic.
You won't be expected to work late to meet the unrealistic deadlines at this time.
We realized that the situation changed and would try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and expectation of the day’s work, we meant to adjust the timeline for the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones as they accommodate their needs or want to work with less schedule for the next few weeks.
The expansion of this timeline greatly reduces the workload and pressures of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and the team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, display, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on the SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired the anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use hospital-grade anti-virus fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own safety screening protocols by using products that support the safety of the tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed COVID-19 protocols to us and all the staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a long-range, full-range service, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based on NYC know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a long distance for the first time.
Our long-working associates realize that it may need to be adjusted and they would like to advise you:
The maximum meeting duration limit is one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to split it into a few days.
Define a close relationship, make an agenda, and send out previous publications.
Make video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
A leading guide to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the speaker's list, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do collaborative records).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to a colleague about the shared work
The SDM Operations team is looking for a webinary-based ergonomics approach to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients to take the community to cancel a public event funded by Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved short-term activity and that no one would be given a pintal because they had to delay or modify the target.
Next week we will follow up with an additional guide on Wikimania and regional community and other topics.
In general, feelings from the entire global community seem to be a sadness over this disturbance, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare the Meta-Wiki page to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other key information related to COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also try to maintain routine communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly impacted.
If you have questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or difficulties about the contours, or other things that may need help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be the linker to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operation International SDM.
None of this change is seen as a relief from work and our responsibilities.
On the other hand, this change is a confirmation that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and provide the service world that they rely on.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other Leadership Team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of the cell (the membrane of the cell) in the lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has an activity that is opposed to angiotensin (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a dot into the cell for some coronary artery.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reversal enzyme is a metaloenzym containing a narrowness of the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has domain M2 peptide terminal-N and domain transporter amino renal acid colectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single I-type membrane membrane protein, with an enzyme active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extra-extruder domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting latent protein is released into the bloodstream and is eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II alveolar cells, small intestinal enterositis, arterial and vena endotel cells, and pure muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as the equivalent of ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin hormone I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino phenylalanine terminal carboxyl acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, enamel, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranged traffic flow membrane transporter Amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the primary entry point into the cell for some coronary artery, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins on the spike or tip of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface causes endositosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosome that lies inside the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the basic S protein by the serum protease inang TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesis that the decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with reduced mortality related to pneumonia, although the results are less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant humans (rhACE2) are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplasakarida.
The period of time in man is about 10 hours with a 30-minute workbook other than the 24-hour effect length.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin (RAS inhibitor) inhibitors or disease with angiotensin II in blood circulation increases. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'Application COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to resume the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contact") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or proposed, receiving official government support in a number of areas and jurisdictions.
Some workframes for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
The privacy issue is questioned, especially with regard to the system based on tracking the geographical location of the application user.
Alternatives that do not involve too much privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, the government of the Tiongkok, along with Alipay, has been distributing applications that allow citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used as TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the display against potentially infected people and quickly respond to the health care authority.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By 14 April 2020, the app is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in the development stage and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security technology at Cambridge University, points to a number of practical problems that may occur in the application-based system, which includes false positives and the likelihood of a lack of effectiveness if data that are taken from the limited application is limited to only a small part of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add the most coronavirus-related application to the App Store, which is limited only to "resmi" organizations or who have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Privatists express their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure made to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations make statements calling for limitations on such surveillance.
This organization sets out eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance must be "as per law, necessary, and proportionate";
The monitoring and surveillance must have a sunset clausa;
data use should be restricted to COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid the more severe discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all "my relevant interests" required, which includes social health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to deal with surveillance problems continuously by removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based, rather than application-based tracking to eliminate the need for downloading applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potential significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and used the central server only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cell phone tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notification through text messages to potential infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted by a wide change in the privacy laws after the Mers has been lifted in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using both the central system and the privacy protection system.
By 6 April 2020, the details have not been released.
The privacy-protective contact tracking is a clear concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Monitoring Approach that protects the Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform for using techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using the location or data intersecting the range to track the COVID-19 spread.
It is based on the study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was initially set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share locations and sensitive health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups with basically the same approach and is a multifaceted protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is the main aspect of achieving broad reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had created the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application as an open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of low energy Bluetooth technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specification of core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
Launching tools to enable government to make official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to address data collection issues and surveillances continue to continue to distribute the system by updating the operating system, and then delete it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition of drugs (also referred to as the gift of new goals, new profiles, or new tasks on drugs or therapeutic alternatives) is a drug that has been approved for the purpose of new treatment, that is, for disease or medical conditions that are different from the original purpose of drug development.
This path is the current scientific research path to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
The other direction of research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several ligan binding sites.
Analysis of these ligan binding sites can be the basis for an effective anti-virus drug development project on COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA polymerase depends on RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphase.
Hussein A A, et al investigated some of the potential potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Klorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune disease.
On March 18, WHO announced that the related chloroconium and hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidaritas clinical test.
Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin tests in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of sulphate hydroxyxicokuin and phosphate chlorokuin based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation.
This treatment is not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized by the United States only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients treated inap, but cannot accept treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxyxicokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" is not established.
The doctor said they used that medicine when "no other choice."
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with sorghum, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Great studies are underway at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU The Langone Medical School is conducting safety and honesty tests on the use of hydroxychorokuin preventives.
The Tiongkok clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved to be "effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in median 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days on 45 patients who did not accept the medication.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given faviravir and half received humifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Body reminds the public that there is evidence to support the drug in a relatively small and early way.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use by the military to send drugs to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump government about the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in the case of a serious disease with a multiplier virus.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant mothers or people who try to contain.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirus lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit is observed".
This drug is designed to hinder HIV replication by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will be bonded with SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is a critique in scientific society about resource guidance to position a drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into the international Solidaritas trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection, and then Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against some phylo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early pre-test studies indicate that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and some ongoing clinical trials include two clinical trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with an ongoing disease and one for those with a serious illness.
There are three clinical trials currently under way for intravenous C vitamins for those treated inhaled and seriously ill COVID-19, two controlled plasebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The New York State started testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japanese National Health and Medical Center (NCGM) is planning clinical trials for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, cortikosteroid inhalation for asthma, for treatment of new presymptomatic coronary infection patients.
For a form of an enzyme angiotensin reversal 2, Phase II trial is under way with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe inhaled case in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to know the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of collimin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require inhalation.
Women who are pregnant or pregnant or do not use effective methods of contraception do not qualify.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular boulevards is often used to treat patients so that it encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients studying the use of enozaparin sodium at prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment to the approved and developed anti-virus drugs for the previous outbreak, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the published Guide to the 7th edition of Tiongkok
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the published Thiongkok guide 7
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs that can be given a new target for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): approved by Tiongkok.
In addition, tests were also carried out in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trial, there is a lot of work being done to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-COV-2, the virus yousatif this disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are currently in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread worldwide in 2020, which led to massive investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genome to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-COV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the thing to be noticed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, spread on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Target platform advanced to Phase I security study, including:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with little public information available (reputed in planning or planning).
Phase I-II trials performed early immunogenicity and safety tests, usually performed randomly, controlled plasebo, and at some locations, while determining the most effective dose.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment (still in the "praclinis" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular graft vaccines that would genetically modify virus proteins to stimulate immune reactions.

On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were starting to develop vaccines.
Janssen works with his biotech partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, the Emergency Biosolutions announced a partnership of production with Vaxart to develop vaccines.
In February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design similar to the technology used for neoantigen cancer vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed vaccine synthesis and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's son, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they started the vaccine project to make peptide vaccines Ii-Key against COVID-19.
They want to produce vaccine candidates that can be tested on humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop vaccines.
On March 5, 2020, the Medical Research Command and the United States Army Army at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were developing vaccines.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Bisolutions announced that they were working together with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
In addition, this partnership announced a plan for clinical testing and clinical trials of Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development at least took about a year to two.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of particles similar to coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump, has offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccines" to CureVac, which was protected by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced partnership with the German company BioNTech, to develop the mRNA-based vaccine together.
Currently, candidates for vaccines based on mRNA, BNT162, are in pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would get the results of the preclinical testing in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who were at the final stage could start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Pediapsian Innovation Coalition Epidemi (ECI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to US$29 million.
Another ECI investment partner for COVID-19 vaccine development is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health official announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates for animals.
Imperial College London research announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could be self-implemented for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days after receiving a sequel from Tiongkok.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced a C$275 million fund for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million special fund to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronary disease occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical Faculty reported PittCoVacc, candidate for COVID-19 vaccines on rats; they stated that "MNA that gives subunit vaccine S1 SARS-CoV-2 causes potential antibodies specific antigen responses [on rats] that begin to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmaceutical Faculty announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit outside of the disease that is prevented.
Further testing in Australia is being carried out by 4,170 health - care workers.
There's a possibility that vaccines in development won't be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine honesty using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-humanized primates, indicates the need for screening steps to reach the level of biological safety 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on non-humanized animal models.
By 2020, no protective medicine or vaccine for SARS has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and the community health institutions around the world, and a proven vaccine for MERS is not yet available.
When the MERS became prevalent, the suspected SARS research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against the MERS-COV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed phase I clinical tests on humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, which were all virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media outlets are creating conspiracy theory that claims that the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The patents cited by various social media outlets refer to patents that exist for genetic and vaccines for other coronary galleries, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and wheezing.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of the ability to kiss, and stomach pain.
Time from date to date is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and fail to cooperate with masticoust organs.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. This virus mainly spreads human beings during close contact, often through small sparks or droplets produced through cough, sneezing, or talking.
Despite the results of breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious up to a long distance.
A person can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very contagious for the first three days after the warning symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the polymerase chain real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) to the nasopharyngeal valve.
The use of masks is encouraged for those suspected of being infected with viruses and for those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by public communities differ; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some recommend their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six areas of WHO.
People who are infected with the virus may not have symptoms or symptoms such as flu, fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or asses in the chests that are constantly, confused, hard to wake up, and face or lips; medical seizures are immediately suggested if these symptoms appear.
The upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, ingestion, or throat pain, can be found, but rarely occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in Tiongkok were initially only with a clinical image of chest failure and palpitation.
In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the organ, and death.
This time is called incubation.
Incubation times for COVID-19 are usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who have had a stroke will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all those who have been infected will experience symptoms.
The role of the unnamed bearer in the transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain unrecognized while being treated in the hospital.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its day-to-day case on April 1st; out of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a virus load on a large scale.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that unsealed cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collector placed in the hallway outside the room produces positive samples for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP), can cause the secret of breathing to turn into aerosols and spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the stools, this risk is believed to be low, the most contagious virus when people are rushed; even though the spread may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/card, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and rubber-holding steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly; soap products describe the layers of the virus’s protective fat, activate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin glukonate (disinfection of the surgeon), is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of saliva was taken in a median of two days after treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day test.
Koronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute breathing syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to acute breathing disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are on the coronavirus that is related to nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which damaged the protective bubble, the SARS-COV-2 close to the first SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected organ of COVID-19 because the virus accesses the inang cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most abundant in alveolar cells type II.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or pelvis" to connect to ACE2 and enter the swimming cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of the infected people treated in the Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miocardial injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in heart function.
The thrombosis (31%) and venereal thromboembolism (25%) were found in the COVID-19 patient in the ICU and may be associated with a bad prognosis. Autopsy in people who died of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammation infiltrates that contain lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithel cell of the airway that expresses ACE2, a heavy COVID-19 patient has symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the T-cell that secretes the pathogenic GM-CSF has been associated with monositis recruitment that secretes inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphostic infiltrates were also reported on autopsy.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
Standard testing method is the reaction of polymerase chain transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained by nasopharyngeal taps; however, the nasal or sputum tap samples can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken within two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Tionkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain (PCR) reaction testing to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) are developing, but not used much.
The experience of Tiongkok with the test shows that it is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the World University of Crowd Disease Hospital suggest a method of detecting infection based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral multilobar floor-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions was found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, craziy paving (lobular septum fertilization with varying alveolar fillings), and consolidation can occur as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopy and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathological finding on autopsy is:
Macroscopes: pleurisity, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of damage caused by virus pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumositis hyperplasia, large atypical pneumositis, interstisial inflammation with lymphosytic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells with many
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudity.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing stages: exudation in alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis lunger
Blood: administered intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouths with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the part in the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene is a suitable hand after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends that the use of the front cover of cloth in public places, partly to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social restraint strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, in order to close schools and workplaces, restrict travel, and cancel large-scale meetings in public.
Limitations also include keeping a distance of at least six feet or six feet [1.8 m].
There has been no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19.Because vaccines are not anticipated until the beginning of 2021, the main part of handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of epidemics, known as "curving".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after spraying noses, coughs, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based handcare treatment that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial handcare treatment is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active for antisepsis hand".
Glycerol is added as moisture.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommended that people who thought they were carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extrecorporum membrane (ECMO) oxygenation has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle and healthy eating patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for people who have mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of Tyeongkok have issued recommendations to deal with COVID-19 sufferers who are treated inap.
Intensive care and lung experts in the United States have made recommendations for treatment from various institutions to be free of charge, i.e., the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical forces recommended parasetamol (asetaminofen) more than ibuprofen for the first line use.
Prevention must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of viruses, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health power that treats COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Outer Air Infection Area (UIR) other than using standard preventive action, contact prevention, and prevention action. CDC describes guidelines for the use of self-protection devices (APDs) during pandemics.
The recommended equipment is: APD coat, respirators or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industry, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation.
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not listed in the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last resort, make masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are.
The type of respiratory support for those who experienced a COVID-19 related respiratory failure is currently being studied for those who are treated inhaled, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow pods or bipositive air supply pressure.
Whether one of these two methods results in the same benefit to those who are ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow canals, and the heavy case occurs more in the elderly (a person over 60 years of age, and especially a person over 80 years of age).
Many advanced countries don't have adequate hospital beds per capita, which restricts the capacity of the health system to deal with sudden surges in the number of cases of COVID-19 that are quite severe so that it requires inhalation.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% COVID-19 sufferers who were treated in pain eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of performing pressure control and high PEEP mode is required to maximize both oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoraks.
High PEEP may not be available on old fans.
Research on the potential for treatment began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are under clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or have been in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried on people with severe disease.
Volunteers who are recommended to WHO are also taking an effective and safe treatment test. The FDA has given temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in the life of a highly or at risk.
Plasma convalescent has not undergone the clinical study required to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tyeongkok launched a mobile app to handle this disease.
The user is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application is capable of detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantine, but also informs the local health officer. Advanced analysis of cell data, facial detection technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track the cell phone data of the suspected coronavirus.
It is taken to treat quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed the telephone location data aggregate to the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russians use facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told that "40% of the citizens are still moving around."
The German government is hacking at the end of 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Higher social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the welfare of society."
This disease can occur mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other general upper respiratory tract disease, such as pills.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less, and in some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In the worst-impact people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of majematical organs.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood flow, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clots, especially increases in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% COVID-19 patients treated inhaled, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture showed an increase in heart enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the epithet and death is ten days, with five days spent in in inhalation.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median of seven days between inhalation and death.
In a study of early cases, median time from early to death symptoms is 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have 2.8% deaths, while women have 1.7% deaths.
Histopathological testing of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudity in both lungs.
Change of siteopathic virus observed on pneumositis.
Image of the lungs is like acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission, observed heart damage, with an increase in troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March's data from the United States, 89% of the people who are treated in pain have an underlying condition, and the availability of medical and social economic resources in one area can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary because of the differences in the region, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Fewer reckonings of mild cases can cause death numbers to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean that the present mortality rate is too low.
They have a 1.4-fold greater probability of having severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4-fold more likely to require intensive care or death than non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from disease, and lung scan showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive treatment syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection gave effective and long-term immunity to people who were cured of this disease.
Immunities may be seen, if you see any other coronavirus behavior, but it has been reported that there are cases of COVID-19 cures followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days after.
This case is believed to be the remaining infection that is worse, and not reinfection.
This virus is suspected to be natural and comes from animals, through widespread infections.
The truth is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed first COVID-19 cases, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of the weekly symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptoms of Awake! on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the management options, the time from the first outbreak, and the population character such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death from SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for death from COVID-19 that was diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-COV-2 infection. The ratio of death on a case shows the number of deaths in a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall death ratio for cases was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) for 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Another measurement includes the number of fatalities (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died from a certain disease, and the number of fatalities of infections (IFRs), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died from a certain disease.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the existence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths classified as COVID-19 death.
In addition, the German health system has not yet been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were starving to death from COVID-19.
The effects of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher on men in the studies carried out in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the difference between men and new women not appearing at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the death toll for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for the difference based on this type of sex is not known, but genetic and behavior factors may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data related to sex for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The percentage of women's sex workers, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of developing the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is the abbreviation for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time identified epidemic: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a particular geographic location (e.g. Tiongkok), animal species, or a group of people, on the way with international recommendations for the adoption that aims to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the usual virus are called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and this disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and disease according to the 2015 guidelines that sought not to use the name location in the name of disease and virus.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal taps and ventilators components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is in great need of a ventilator valve, and the receiver can't give it in a necessary timescale, a local company is looking around and printing 100 valves that are needed in the night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 plague, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information emerges about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral replication on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There has been no approved vaccine or medicine to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization practised "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of the four anti-virus compoundes already in existence with the most promising honesty.
Vaccine is not available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous study of SARS-COV used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 also used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, researchers aim to make the vaccine whole.
The use of the virus, whether the virus is inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (dna or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making a vaccine).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus, which has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven trials to evaluate approved treatment for malaria, include four studies of hydroxyxicokuin or chlorokuin.
Antiviral drugs that have been given a new target form most of the research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a short reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs has already existed.Some of the antiviral drugs currently being evaluated for COVID-19, including redesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxyklorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there is temporary evidence for redesivir honesty.
Clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the United States, China, and Italy. Klorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is a call for a review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, while recommending a one gram daily dose, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued authorization for emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of a doctor who treats patients with COVID-19.The published 7th edition of Tionkok also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high dose ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Research shows that early priming of the protease protein in transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chlorokuin and hydroxyxicokuin with or without azithromycin have a large limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Siteokin storm complications can occur at the COVID-19 further step weight.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have antisytokin properties. Tocilizumab has been put into the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of the Chinese after a small study has been completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 nonaccidental testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results on people with severe disease.
Concombined with serum feritin's blood test to identify a sitein's storm, this drug is meant to fight a sitein's storm, which is expected to cause death to some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of siteatin-refracter steroid release syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, no random and controlled evidence has shown that tocilizumab is a good treatment for CRS.
Transferring the purified and bonded antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a passive nonvaccin immunosation method.
This strategy was tested for SARS with non-conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a work mechanism expected for passive antibiotic therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular sitotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagositosis, are also possible.
Another passive antibiotic therapy, for example, uses monoclonal antibodies that are produced, is in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is part of the blood of patients who have been cured and containing specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronative disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who then became infected and died because of COVID-19 after the outbreak of consciousness would spread the virus.
