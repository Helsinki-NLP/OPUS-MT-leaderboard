Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare themselves for a peak of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to more severe injuries requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, in the Province of Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day impact of COVID-19, taking into account the natural development of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8 a.m. at 15 March 2020 with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed the incidence of Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase occurred around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As at 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in the protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
As early as March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with IADOC-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that the hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
However, there is a need for systematic collection in order to complement the current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of the overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CECCM's rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case and intensive care bed data should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2, as well as for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CECPM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from an approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window where each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have to deal with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by the Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-COV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicative, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to stay closed for the entire golden week and for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 containing the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and forecasting, and will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common rums 4.
However, over the course of this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which triggered an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is thus the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1,1 of pneumonia homes then of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, considered as the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final range and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more importantly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses constitute a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a simple BRN.
They can be classified into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to alpha and beta.
Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and to the dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP4) cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first generic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-ronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the seafood market from Huanan to Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receiver of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by the orf8.
The ORf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known fields or functional motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete Cryo-ME structure of the ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the Amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which presented open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to the Man via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two coronaviruses of SARS type from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect the Man remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., made the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted bats to the Man by snakes, which would imply a homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-museum mammal that feeds on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by genetic homology at 99% between a coronary virus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 per cent difference between two genomes is a difference of importance; conclusive results should therefore be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform as well as other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on immunological response to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system innate by means of molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RRLs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and type I (IFN) interferon synthesis that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive response from the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can result in severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-viseral failure or even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 reported cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range of 0-24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine according to the most accurate incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus is quarantined for 14 days.
Does it have to be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, fainting, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the disease appeared.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory care.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family and home after transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, or more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
Regarding SARS, it was found that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and that ventilatory care was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate for VOCID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the epidemics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a gathering or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or in other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that re-established patients may once again be carriers of the virus, stressing the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (including lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and high myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or depolitic glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas trade.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the lung capacity to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a breakdown of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleal syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical events began to be used for diagnosis (which was then no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical events, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic HRN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a reactive tray in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicity, if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of restored patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working on developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an excessive response to the immune system results in cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-viral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blockage of cytokines IFN-Δ, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, signal suppressor of cytokines 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not benefit from severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of short cycles of low-to-moderate corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, redesivir also demonstrated potential inhibition of other simple-brin RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead forwarded the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients restored and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured of a contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was then extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed in order to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
Antibodies in the blood are usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known as they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or severe remission of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in provinces of China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only 30% of the patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (OM) only and combined treatment with MO and TCM.
It was found that the period of return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of increase in symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through larger-scale controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 usually feel a deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may result in increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early years of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the patients regarding the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to anyone else in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal tanks and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity from SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in older people and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against a zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went out 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time frame (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, developing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS forecast, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over the age of 50 according to a study conducted in 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a forecast factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be related to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may result in hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) rate in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a factor of potential prognosis of the disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 forecast was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also be involved in the development of the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue lesions.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of chest X-ray and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with the other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used for supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
As high dose corticosteroids were widely used for serious SARS cases, many survivors had a vascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental Stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to provide long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and regain a normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to being replicated in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause any symptoms in the first stage of infection, as do coronaviruses from common rums.
As a result, newly infected individuals or incubation can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-COV was transmitted by patients with severe disease, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of nearly all the population to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the samples of the middle nasal horn and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible for SARS-CoV-2 to weaken in terms of infection to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and also possible by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Caution should therefore be taken in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they may be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions able to enter completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses may also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus might have penetrated his body by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert condition after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population by saying that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, since each word counts and may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than to expect formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the system of response of society on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing of this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic gives rise to an already-view impression.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also more important in older people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by patients with serious illness, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 DNA detection tests may prove negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be positive again to the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, e.g. bats, to the Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus enter the cells of the airways exactly and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like the SARS or resurface regularly as the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, no matter what expenditure this must entail, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
In addition to super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function tests, and high creatinine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of SARS suspicion.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower airways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, older people and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to communicate effectively and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an evolving acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most fatal viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saddle samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate destiny of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCOVs caused moderate symptoms were well suited to man.
In other words, both might be survivors of previous HCOV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCOVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow for accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host's restriction factors.
In this context, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more the number of people infected is important, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to man.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by forty or other control measures of infection.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCOV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCOV acquired in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without an animal reservoir or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCOVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCOV if it is home to a nearby ascendant who shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often been well adapted and is non-pathogenous for its host.
Similarly, a container host houses HCOV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou's market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate host amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and to the generic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
That's why bats cannot be the MERS-CoV's intermediate tank host.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromades were HIV-positive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-COV, as have camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels secrete the virus not only through the airways, but also through fecal pathways, which is also the main excretion route for bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the distance between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-coV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, the zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be from the bat coV, while the HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parent viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock in about 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near HCOV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpagas.
The alpha-COV of HCOV-229E-related mice are numerous and non-pathogenic in mice, while the alpha-COV of alpaga caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCOV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-coVs serve as HCOV-229E genetic reservoirs, alpagas and dromadaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromadaries and dromadaries to humans.
The evolving origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and was also reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in drugstores for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several opportunities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats by cutting or mining coal.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amp hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the removal and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been both in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-bred RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
Nevertheless, CoV mutation rates are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well suited to the host.
Compared with SARS-COV, with a high mutation rate, the rate of mutation of SARS-COV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the dromads.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render short-term ineffective vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Third, CoVs change randomly and frequently as a model when replicating the RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein unit S means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times that of this link compared to that observed between human ACE2 and S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCOV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated serum acid for HCOV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCOV reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromadars and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCOV: return to departure box
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are HCOV genetic reserves.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as the mouse-chain viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but were codifying divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in drugstores in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a discontinuance of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by elevated metabolic activity of bats could both remove CoV replication and affect "relight" by exoribonuclesase, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host tanks such as bats and camels.
They reply strongly without causing a strong host's immune response.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and causing cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the higher the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflamasomes is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95 % nucleotide homologous bat-coV with SARS-coV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide coV with SARS-coV-2.
Remarkably similar beta-coV of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned under the ramplight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in the wild animals markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of contagion occurs.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality rates during childbirth at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five, making nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could result in eczema or hand dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
Deforestation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaning agent for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils bearing dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace an adequate washing of hands unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than known antimicrobials or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for hands without alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the earth or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Make a generous amount of soap to the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap eliminates germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Fret for at least 20 seconds.
The friction creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and to rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail varnish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a slurry or gourd suspended and drilled and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cruce suspended using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a bread of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After hand washing and drying in hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the pulp of the fingers of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands wet and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other passing between fingers.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the valve (and open the exit door if applicable).
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("germs") and avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When flushing, water should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are the most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Hand Washing is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to foster behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates hand washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of washing hands with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the smells of fetides called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
and all chest pain should be treated this way, especially at your age
and especially if you have fever
and your cholesterol and tension must also be controlled

Do you have any other symptoms?

'Cause it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely to follow the pressure exerted in the selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
For example, complete ORF4 loss in the HCOV-229E prototype strain can be mentioned as a result of a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a discontinuance of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules in the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by elevated metabolic activity of bats could both remove CoV replication and affect "relight" by exoribonuclesase, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host tanks such as bats and camels.
They reply strongly without causing a strong host's immune response.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and causing cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the higher the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflamasomes is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a 95 % nucleotide homologous bat-coV with SARS-coV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide coV with SARS-coV-2.
While civettes and other animals on the market have been discovered as the same virus carriers in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Remarkably similar beta-coV of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned under the ramplight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has strongly altered our perception of the role played by zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCOVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from the bat and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing fresh product markets and killing the civets found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how such transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in the wild animals markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not lacking for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or mortal CoVs in man in the future.
The cultivation of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of contagion occurs.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, man's probability of being in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-COV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help to clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute coronary artery syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has attracted much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published in seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some contexts substantially changed.
Having received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter presented a proposal for a simple evaluation based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Version Test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspicious case must involve one of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in a restricted area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging having the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on the suspected case with any evidence of pathological or serological evidence as follows: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) severely homogeneity of the entire viral genome with known new coronary virus; (3) positive serological test for IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of airways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of the caution with regard to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people who did not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to forward their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh Announces Five New COVID-19 Deaths, A Daily Record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (RAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly HCOV infection could be.
Most HCOVs come from bats where they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCOVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also allow better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCOVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future infections.
The CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present all over the world and appear to transmit mainly in winter in temperate climate countries.
Shops in Australia reduce the limits of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of two toilet paper and one package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently had reservations due to fear of COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock breakage within the hour of delivery," and qualified the "unprecedented" request, while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales showed a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, stated that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that the local council's restrictions on truck deliveries make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology in Queensland, explained that stores re-supply stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky article, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buyed] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives has Crap declared last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures the Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures the Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer during auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Work Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a printed newspaper in Darwin, included an eight-page package designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report dated March 3 of ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in the context of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, leading to over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of ongoing coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and fainting.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and restraining suspected people from being infected.
The authorities worldwide have responded by introducing restrictions on travel, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Misinformation on the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred to Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as to other people from areas with numerous cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an unknown cause pneumonia home on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the market for large seafood from Huanan and the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person who presented symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious link to the subsequent home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first household reported in December 2019, the two thirds proved to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, among a 55-year-old person in the Province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a high underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of persons tested at COVID-19, and the test has been confirmed positive in accordance with the official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had for official policies not to test those who had only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the period between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official accounts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who were tested positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesperson of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the H1N1 outbreak of swine influenza in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and above all health. The death-case report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the World Death Case Report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the death-case report decreased from 17.3% (for symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed with illness, and the infection rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosised and undiagnosed) who suffer from disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to recede when the disease has just missed available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
The Chief Medical Advisor of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (in possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—disappears completely” and that it "may turn into seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretions (muscosity), loss of smell, fainting, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six person is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septicism, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then the researchers gave recommendations that those who had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio assessments range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and onset of symptoms) varies between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of persons carrying the COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly in close contact and by fine drops produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that unprotected coughing can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during the expiration, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airported.
Postillons may land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days prior to the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few confirmed asymptomatic case reports in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the British authorities recommend washing their hands after having touched animals, as after having been in contact with other areas that infected people may have affected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenre Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the entire genome of another mouse bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one different amino acid in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolins and humans.
The comparison of the genome as a whole has shown to date a maximum of 92 per cent of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is made by inverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected or scanned secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and the Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as an initial test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sampling but a throat sampling can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodensitometry (scan) of individuals with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral depolitic glass opacitys and a lack of pleural thickening.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to cross-relationship with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is limited in accuracy to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, calling for it to be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive networks of artificial intelligence-based neurons have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imaging, both on X-rays and scanners.
Preventive strategies for the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who were already infected were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential displacements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take usual precautions and contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, brushing their nose and scratching with oral bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 %, and iodine at 0.2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a nursery, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when they cough or sneez, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance passed by the designed posters by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of their hands."The use of masks has also been recommended to those taking care of a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a patient with COVID-19, even if they recognize that wearing the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical masks in fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or hot spots.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public departures without a mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of trains and long-distance buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handicraft mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, avoiding contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum level of meetings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, the CDC has been invited to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by maintaining social links, whether virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" meant that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to follow during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were last exposed.
Epidemic control strategies are eradication or suppression, and mitigation.
Indication is established in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: steps are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures to address and mitigate may be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures, in order to weaken the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and increases time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, wearing of masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures have been taken in China as long as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict prohibition of travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and quarantines, and issued warnings on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face important challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be privileged, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise transmission rebounds rapidly when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking non-prescription drugs against cold or drinking and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, canceling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive at COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the Province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronaviruses in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market for large seafood of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A household of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the Province of Hubei, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation early in January. At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the migration of the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and over 364,000 were cured.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to address such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or confinement orders) and curfews. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, are subjected to confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown case of pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "publishing rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of leave for the Spring party.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport was modified and museums in China were temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been involved in one form or another of movement restrictions. After the epidemic entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day stay for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that even if it was not "a recommendation of WHO", however, it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and spoke of a "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, particularly for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".

On 11 March, WHO stated that the Coronavirus epidemic could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned both with the alarming levels of spread and severity and with the alarming levels of inaction."

Some Chinese senior officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the Coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus," stating that in China "the censorship has over-fed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which has been taxed by some opponents to "distort the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained a telegram from the U.S. government exposing the main lines of a communication strategy apparently emanating from the National Security Council, the strategy cited here is: "Everything comes from China.

This has also resulted in a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to the customs to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages planned in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
The food rays have only been emptied temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government have released pig reserves to ensure adequate population survival.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.

In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves locked up in their homes in domestic or cornered provinces of the Province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) unemployed. Angus Reid Institute's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the mid-March 2020 confinement.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Almost half a million German companies had their employees lowered to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both waged and self-employed, at the global level.
The arts and cultural organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The cinema industry has also suffered an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the period of Christian penance of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, on-line and on-line or television, while others propose to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square which emptied itself from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest interruption of the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Football England Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which was initially due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming facilities around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have found a significant increase in their number of new entries. The show world has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many Internet mimes on the topic of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, an upsurge of prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a just punishment.
Some African countries have also noted an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, who live in the first country of Europe to undergo a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese from entering their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become angry on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
American President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have been harassed in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bharatiya's West Bengal unit Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them."
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were attracted by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "cleared".
Many pay access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory screening of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory disease and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary virus DNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibodies tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including individuals whose symptoms were too light to be declared or asymptomatic individuals.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported lethality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
By using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal elbow or the expectoration sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharynx hatches is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a crack (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-quality SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to be authorized for emergency use by the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have a low diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodesitometry] can be conclusive before symptoms occur".
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depoliated glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, albeit less precise, several of its imaging results that coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "the TDM be not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CRTs) or by patient's hair test (point-of-care testing, POCs).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For LCT, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the CCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.By March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were performing enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspected cases can remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients crack inside, return and later receive the result of the test.The British NHS has announced that it conducts a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the framework of the COVID-19 test for suspected cases, a health professional will take a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, test drives were available in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at 12/2020, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020 and 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the same time, pooling samples and conducting testing only if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese, namely "firebird" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and may treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
Through its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that the cases in Hubei province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multi-xed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manipulative robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and the purchase of a high-speed laboratory across the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Various test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations for testing of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reservoirs of cobblestones and chemical reagents have exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs presented "failure".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the kits that have given incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by forty of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of people who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, has yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, carried out two series of tests for the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people with positive outcomes had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools resumed on the date scheduled for the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic by means of aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the greatest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive samples and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories to conduct confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only persons admitted to the hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Washing hands, also called hand hygiene, is the fact of cleaning hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal means.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands ash. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after having soaked or coughed/stained;
after having affected an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality rates during childbirth at home.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income areas with drinking water.
Washing your hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48 per cent and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRA). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five, making nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by about half the deaths due to diarrhea and by one quarter the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Washing hands is usually associated with other health measures in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could result in eczema or hand dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (mixion, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after having treated a cut or injury, after suffocating, coughing or getting wet, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after affecting garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-cleaning of soap is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries and on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest (23%) rate. Today, there are several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for washing hands at key times of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children become accustomed to doing so.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
Deforestation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soap or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaning agent for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to soluble in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are flushed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils bearing dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (decrease of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4-5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against the bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace an adequate washing of hands unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than known antimicrobials or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for hands without alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many people do not have the means to buy soap, rather using ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the earth or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be washed properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Make a generous amount of soap to the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap eliminates germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Fret for at least 20 seconds.
The friction creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and to rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail varnish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a slurry or gourd suspended and drilled and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cruce suspended using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a bread of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry wiped out, the European Fabric Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet hands.
After hand washing and drying in hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the pulp of the fingers of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blowes from the air out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and apparatus and possibly contaminate other toilet users as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows micro-organisms to be broadcast at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands in the medical environment became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands wet and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other passing between fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since germs present in water are likely to remain on hand, it is important to rinse and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the valve (and open the exit door if applicable).
This avoids the recontamation of the hands to the contact of the surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("germs") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is established.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" on hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (we know "drugs" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotics resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frotter" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a product of washing based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When flushing, water should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, hands should be dried with sterile linen and a surgical helmet should be put on.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with ordinary soap with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores that are hard on hand. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to the patient and to provide written and verbal reminders on this matter.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are the most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered to be a inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health and even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand-washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, publicize the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in long-term behaviour within the population.
To achieve this, follow-up and evaluation activities are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies has shown that local approaches are effective in increasing the hand-washing rate in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective; with regard to the promotion of hand-washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Hand Washing is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to foster behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e. avoidance of DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of washing hands with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for those in vulnerable situations such as birth mothers or soldiers injured in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing care".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the smells of fetides called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash your hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It comes from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary stain, symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and that she urged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after recalling to have committed acts contrary to ethics or considering doing so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to value hand washing devices more highly.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (teilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
COVID 19 risk controls at the workplace
The workplace risk controls of COVID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower-risk exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic preventive measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label, and maintenance of routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure-risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but which may be infected due to an ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic glazing and the provision of individual protective equipment in the event of a meeting with a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilating rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (e.g., out of top hours or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls necessary to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations likely to arise as a result of the epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response targets include reduction of transmission among staff, protection of people at higher risk of medical complications, maintenance of business operations and reduction of adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy is an overall framework used in health and safety at work to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve insulating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers. They can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls shall designate changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The recommended basic prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneez, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or working hours if necessary, deterring workers from using other people's tools and equipment and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have had fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fevers or other medications acting on symptoms. They also recommend that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, jobs at risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but which may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to a community transmission in progress around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high population density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a Client Service drive window. Administrative controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, replacement of in-person meetings by virtual communications, protection of fixed working hours, non-essential travel to areas with active COVID19 epidemics, development of emergency communications plans, replacement of in-person meetings by means of virtual communications, protection of fixed hours of work, interruption of non-essential working hours of work, interruption of non-essential travel to areas with active COVID19 epidemics, development of emergency communications plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, provision of personal protection and protection of living conditions on the basis of living conditions on the basis of living conditions of living conditions and of living conditions of living conditions and living conditions of living and living conditions of living and living conditions of living conditions of living and living conditions of living and living conditions of living and living conditions of living and living conditions of living and living in the living conditions of living conditions of living conditions of living and living conditions of living conditions of living and living conditions of living conditions of living and living and living in the living conditions of living and living conditions of living conditions of persons of living and living and living and living and living in the living conditions of persons of living and living and living in the living and living in the living conditions of living and living in the living in the living conditions of living conditions of living conditions of living in the living in the conditions of living conditions of persons of living in the living and of living and of living in the living in the conditions of persons of living of persons of living in the
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an airplane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protection mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose by means of handkerchiefs when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or affects organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable goods must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls shall include the postponement of travel in case of illness as well as the self-isolation and immediate information of the medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For school and childcare establishments, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of the community's spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education courses or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, delaying arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu-like symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement forces performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
Order force officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using household detergents or sprays and follow the standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPEs as well as containment and washing of clothing.
The OSHA considers some health workers and funeral workers to be members of high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling samples of patients with suspected or known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of people's bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when performing aerosol production procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
Samples shall be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other IPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for those working less than 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-COV-2 infection and those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 NIOSH-approved or higher-approved respiratory masks must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to those directly involved in its care, using the PPE necessary for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJET: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare the future
EXPIRY DATE/HOUR: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have toward each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The fellowship and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to be among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me about his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our jobs of time
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our employment of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our goal of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run races or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or leave with pay required: simply prevent your superior and help your team review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at COVID-19, please warn Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and make sure that your situation gets the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues in the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Confidence &amp; Security and Fund Collection teams (among others) perform a critical job that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, and we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt any later.
We do not intend to "work twice as much to catch up on lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to do overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines now.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new objectives and timelines, if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning) ?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on critical work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we confirm.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol, which uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a site in WeWork, which shared with us and all of the staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a configuration entirely remotely in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who are familiar with distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to meetings by up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an electronic mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinaries to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delays or changes in these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness over the upheaval and relief from clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the CRT is working on the creation of a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary meeting of staff next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By now, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be considered as a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps that we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us at the moment.
For now, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps in the months to come.
We need each and every one of you to achieve this, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to give you the best of your own time.
Finally, if you like: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of end-of-life peptide N and a field of collectrine transporter of amino acid renal end-of-life C.
ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein of type I, whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane primarily to cell cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, fat intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle arterial cells in most organs.
The expression of ACE2's DNAm is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
The ACE clicates the angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2, in turn, clicks the carboxylated phenylamine amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also crack several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral Amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronary viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus originally originated from SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originally from COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme in the endosoms within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serine protein, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is presented as innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of 24 hours of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people intolerant to classical renal-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high angiotensin-II circulation. RhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identification of persons ("contacts") that may be contacted with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and in some jurisdictions.
Several infrastructure has been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android operating systems and iOS of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with persons carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be returned to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that provides a trace of exposure to potentially infected people and rapidly communicating with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the application of contact tracing was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering setting up applications on TraceTogether's model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a georperage application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, in order to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of lying or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally reliable organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Activists for privacy have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has gone away.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for such monitoring to be limited.
These organizations set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
supervision should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrablely protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any data sharing with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Report One Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the mechanism for tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, the network tracing was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have significant privacy concerns.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on the tracing of mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made localization information accessible to the public, which was authorized as a result of the profound changes to the privacy protection laws of information after the MERS epidemic that affected that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The privacy tracking of contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matching data is made on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to enable users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-respecting coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way as the remote threat.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofilation, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved drug for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was initially developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites offers the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are the papaine-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is also an antipaludean medicine used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be one of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the clinical trial process of the FDA and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Physicians have indicated that they use this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Broader studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received humifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is slim and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medication to university hospitals where the medication would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to reproduce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals concluded that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remedesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one dealing with people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more serious forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against platibo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing on azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin's alvesco (cyclesonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a phase II test is under way with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over 40 years of age who have been diagnosed positive at COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Humifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a mortgage vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many attempts to develop are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-COV-2, a virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was reported worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As ECE scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are at the first stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (assumed in the course of planning or design).
A phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against platobo and carried out in several centers all, by determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the assessment phase on the human person (always in preclinical research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to coronavirus through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently being researched in the laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money to benefit from exclusive access to the Vaccine against COVID-19", which sparked the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a DNA vaccine.
The BNT162 RNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing phase with the beginning of the expected clinical trials in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of ECI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other investment partners of ECI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after China sent the sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 millionC dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University of Medicine indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, asserting that "the subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro- needles triggered an important response of antigen specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Pharmacy School at Waterloo University announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate antibody production against SARS-COV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-based IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there was no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for the development of vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one vaccine against MERS (DNA-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and fainting.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases lead to moderate symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly in proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced at expiration, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on wearing the mask by the public in general vary, some authorities discourage their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the countries of the six regions of WHO.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
That's what the incubation period is called.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may last up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected individuals who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both spectoration and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Strong talk releases more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore revealed that unprotected coughing can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about the propagation by the saddles, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on copper at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease home.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is the most abundant in alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "picule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were reported among 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The receptors of ACE 2 are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed widespread alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for epithelial cells of the airways expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary disease in patients with IADOC-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngous sampling; however, a nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independent polymerization reaction tests (CPRs) to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possible to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral depolital glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, craziy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar lining) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia in the process of healing: organization of exuds in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent washing of hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, good breathing hygiene and avoiding eye, nose or mouth touching with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a fabric in public places to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and reversing major groupings of people.
The distance directives also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known medication to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 as early as possible, one key element of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "plating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants are not available, WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as moisture.
People are treated for support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful in those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the CCCI.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in conditions of care when the procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the individual be placed in an isolation chamber adapted to air infection (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines on the use of individual protection equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks are preferred (to facial masks).
Respiratory masks N95 are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (US).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a high-speed nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level airways.
It is unknown whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years, and especially those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and a high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medicine may be used in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary permission to plasma for convalescent individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend the auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of persons suspected of having the coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, too, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that he was informed by mobile operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hack weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases are usually restored in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, however, there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can move rapidly towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, clotting disorders, and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of the patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Commission on Chinese Health (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering of moderate cases may result in over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and presented a 2.4-fold higher risk of intensive care or death compared to non-smokers. Concerns were also observed in relation to long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration observed a drop of 20% to 30% in respiratory capacity in some people who were cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic injuries.
This can also lead to post-intense care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 healers followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravating latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by propagating the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by a human transmission to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary in regions and in time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the death/wage ratio worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and not all deaths related to COVID-19 may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in the 50s, the difference between men and women who only disappears at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The specific reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immune gender differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in comorbidity men such as hypertension at a less advanced age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronovirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of 2019-nCov temporary disease names and 2019-nCOV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
In view of the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as buckets and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in due course, a local startup retro-conceived and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-COV is used as both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in case of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these researches focus on speculum S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (dna or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries expected to be reported at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of VOCID-19 candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including redesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of redesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some demand independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by virtue of an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients at COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial spicule protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 is being tested unrandomized at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected persons.
The Interleukine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokine relaxation syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serums, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
