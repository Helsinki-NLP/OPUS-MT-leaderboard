At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange goes down in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall from the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilisation plan of the U.S. financial sector, is therefore also noticeable in us.
Action impact in Asia
Asian scholarships experience a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indexes managed, during the day, to eliminate some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hongkong Stock Exchange lost four percent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the Hong Kong Stock Exchange movement lost 3.8 percent, with the markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about US rescue action will affect the financial markets around the world," notes Joseph Yam, head of Hongkong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong was part of China, it established its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries may be affected.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed support of the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus refused the appeal to support President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares live on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indexes of shares have been the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having suffered a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress Ceda: US Government Can Inject $700 billion in Banks · Global Voices
The U.S. Congress leaders and President George W. Bush's government agreed on a broader form of the American financial assistance agreement.
It will be put to the vote in the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not for sure.
Before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters Barney Frank, president of the Board's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor in restoring financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great deal of progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions on how the package should have measures for market stabilization," entrusted Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
In her view, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government the foundation a final form.
It should buy from financial corporations the inventible real estate assets that result in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, do not escape Harry Reid, the legislators make the Congress reach a final agreement on Sunday.
In this way, they want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could influence Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of Congress are going to vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still have several changes.
The total amount intended for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the grant of the remaining amount, in two steps: first, an additional $100 billion and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, the Congress, it, has the opportunity to put it into a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value dropped, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to the vote on the bill, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The president of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the settlement agreement, the development of the plan on the time axis.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides for aid for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages that it will redeem, while lowering the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to the economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of repurchase of assets with problems.
This point will be decisive to resolve the loss-sharing between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important that it is.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," underlined Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and on the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put on the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's in your shelves stuffed vinyl discs, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming at least of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a fan of Pink Floyd would have a hard time supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is broad.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and text sending, it is able to read music and movies, to record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, until it is used for navigation.
And if you take into account Smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
The larger the number of functions you use, the greater the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
Mobiles that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are much more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect them to play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, it happens to you to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second reload for the job - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, after reloading, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reduction, given the minute dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
For readers, you do not need, except iPod, any software.
Simply fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or then the judgment of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the way of Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, you are especially interested in the life span of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and type of output of the device and, of course, in the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
All come to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach until you will have this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also come to read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding operator's (or other provider's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases it is limited to quick-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have on you headphones or a handfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in frames, which have virtually all the mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally costs less than three thousand.
For a prize of three four thousand crowns, we can already have a very convenient walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the lack of output for regular headphones.
The price of the best and best-used phones, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Truly anyone can assure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a swapable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models normally only support maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cown, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent command keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the command is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifespan of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
Maybe it won't be a long time.
We have already mentioned, many times, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTú (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
As a result of the last steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that Czech prices are kept so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this respect, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Agency (ČTú), who stated on several occasions that there was no room for another operator in Czech Czech Republic, is horrified with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network seems to have no more chance (in fact, at present, it would find only very difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which the traditional operators had to react as well.
However, even before the arrival of such party disturbances as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were allowed to be heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there remained room for such operators and that they could be truly successful.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the Virtual Operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there's the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:phone in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be possible to walk also at home.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so that it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czech negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a phone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not been hiding, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's spokesperson.
So perhaps the future is promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we may be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by complete silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telephonika O2, mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specific nature of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová stated in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
She added: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator should appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the completion of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what we believe means most contributions from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The mobile operators' approach is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profit.
How, then, is it good to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know to hear themselves as larvae in the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, when creating the U:fon, was that exerted by the T-Mobile company.
They demonstrate the information available to the public from the ČTú web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is ready to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "The competition in the mobile market has also been recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the RT mobile market, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would, and above all, make it subject to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
It is not, however, just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in the economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
A statement made in this way would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one is taking advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
More and more, Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreigners, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, pressure towards honest market operation and lower prices are apparently not part of UOHS's interests.
What is really shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of essence strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noticed any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, none therefore have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening up of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even lacking from the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTU that telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for UOHS that three mobile operators proceed visibly in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility for ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which UOHS washes its hands.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of ČTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of UOHS must know it very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work
However, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo-operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unseen.
These are companies publishing their own mobile phone price lists, but they are only partially public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile phone services are offered for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected candidates.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company makes it before the operator is a classic company client, which controls a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you mention happened, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the society in question," answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity would not reach the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card on their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary mobile operators' customers."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to ČTú.
In addition, another question is asked at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that UOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to unveil such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decline in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators were trying, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers, were involved.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators deal with this issue in the form of a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we can only get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more beneficial than profitable.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the cog.
If the coulisse information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at home, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS can hardly remain impassible in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will cease to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mëj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good word, so that we understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
For the first time in 1834, Kde domov resounded on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Public transport (MHD) pragois will introduce, Wednesday, the chip into their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Agency of Transport) as the date on which they will ride in the subway, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both register it on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons over the Internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they have so far had to tramp impatience in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon over the Internet and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the 13 Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, which will help those interested with Internet purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Along with libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the stations of Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon bought previously will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovana doprava (integrated transport of Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which design the schedules of the Pragois public transport.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's seat.
During boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the smart card, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when the coupon expires, can once again join the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudets called for a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Sudets in 1945 called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter from the collections of Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Southern Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Swedes Germans allegedly addressed the US president with such a desire.
This stems from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter ask the US president not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, whose fate of Šumava is at heart."
Since the Czech Republic's rally is allegedly promising - with the knowledge of Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without considering the opinion of the quarter of millions of people," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA questioned the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudets of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least see that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them admitted such an opportunity.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Česke Budějovice, confirmed it.
During the war, it was, as German of Česke Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the catch camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don’t even think about it!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that is intended to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš's office is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol by driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants above all to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t even think about it!
The phrase "Don't Think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a scourge of blood, there's the phrase "You Will Pay."
Which must symbolize that life can be paid a moment of attention.
The spots will "hate" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be commonly seen with drastic images of accident victims.
It believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by making time when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would make peace in exchange for almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, spoke in favour of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied), even all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed later.
Retreat of the heights of the Golan
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retirement from the heights of the Golan, which he felt was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite Movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (Shiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the drivers in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency's bus company near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether drivers and passengers can during the journey move within the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally enforced, the activity of a driver was contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road on the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident or even brake sharply, even when the driver serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical sheet equipped with standing places or not.
If this standing-place equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance bus Student Agency does not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits the movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we found that passengers can go to the toilets during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement is involved in this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"It all depends on the fact that the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a maximum speed limited, long-distance with standing spaces and a higher authorized speed and long distance buses without standing at the highest maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (safety of road traffic) safely in transport, does not see the movement of drivers on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on planes.
Nor is it certain when turbulence will occur, and the hostess of the air can shape its head."
"Now, in the event that the bus would have brake sharply, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
Just like on an urban bus or on a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the drivers by internal requirements," he said and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of drivers.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their job as a risky job.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason why the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvina, who assures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines, is not present in his vehicles.
"We don't have any hosts, we have opposed them from the very beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said a year ago at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has come.
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop belt without using flashing and it blocked the way to the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he froze it on his right side.
Jančura refuses to sell both seats reserved for the waiters' rest.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for financial compensation, it also counts on the offender.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of the drivers on board the bus.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on that point.
In fact, she does not care too much about buses, but rather about the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the bus drivers as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers were based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the financial institutions of Düsseldorf with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could form, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "block of competence" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, wounded, is always under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for the Surveillance of Financial Services, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was counted in the search for a future solution.
It has, however, been a matter for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse customers by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported during the presentation of the figures for the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the pools of savings banks, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct discussions with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
However, the talks have only just begun, we say in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial space, is involved in the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Hesse Land Government was speaking against any Hellaba's involvement in them.
Later on, the other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was connected to the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg Bank in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new talks on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Lastly, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, spoken against any commercial strategy of merger with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling appears to be widespread that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could become first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers should increase, potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far been more resistant to the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The pooling of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, fired a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain rigorous.
However, such geo-strategic reflections only reflect one aspect.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, through which commercial model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German pooling of savings and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb takeover could take place, a trace that is obviously not wanted here.
This is also discussed in the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any event, a `global solution' would be covered for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter barrel of beer from the brand Kaiser, there is a well-built beard that shows to about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds his dog can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puerta Novo station, four buses leave this evening at 23h45, `destination Monaco, festival della beerra', arriving at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South American bears sing and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long coat with false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing but this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German speaking group manager - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are riding in the night on the motorway direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets quiet on the bus, travellers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make one more break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, squeezing from the little yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left `Beer Day' in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `knowscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: `When the doors of the beer-chamber open, one runs', cries Marco in the morning.
Run!' Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, you must divide them into the room!'
The chop, baby Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to record it!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `To-night, to be back here ten and a half hours ago!' Understand?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone new yellow hats to the trees to find the way, the panels and even an electoral poster of a large popular Bavarian party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; we speak of 50,000 who are going through the Alps and collapse into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The police are reinforced by seven Southern Tyrolean police officers, by Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out statistics on the countries where Italians take first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word `relatively' and that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This really happened this weekend.
The financial of Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in confidence told Reuters on Monday that aid appropriations are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's the Depfa daughter company that supports losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state finance had been refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which has been no longer possible since mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the own capital rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, down to zero, the profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant benefits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's businesses that the deficit in earnings of approximately 16 per cent has been moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financial had first been poorly speculated on industrial real estate credits, which had then been affiliated with the Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not cost-effective, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter-society, Hypo Real Estate must make depreciations that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains still quite vague.
The fact is the dividends have been amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the acquisition of the Depfa, a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks again significantly tari, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part annually - approximately EUR 50 billion - of all the appropriations of the Depfa in a short-term way of refinancing.
According to a statement by the Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group's funding is covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of working state at present.
Other sources say that refinancing will be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that the ability of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and the impact of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in restoring the spirits either.
The share rate fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the course of obligations is particularly successful.
While first-in-chief debts have barely moved, second-class loans are slowing down.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter Württemberg Hypo and those of course who have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the Defa bank.
While emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that delays can be resupplied over time.
Or what no one dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a simple, well-founded hope.
This should provide long-term creditors with nights of insomnia to determine whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line on as a result of deferral of losses for the coming years on the next income tax of the automatically collected stock market earners.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to show up for the first day at Highschool in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trading log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was I excited about?
I was scared already to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the 40-minute train to the High School in Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, but fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not appear to be fixed as strictly as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours until nine hours less than twenty, a table tower starts with the professor, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all like to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue tops and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I presented myself before the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, laughed and made signs, and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the indispensable vocabulary for the survival of Japanese adolescents and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she thought it was an honour that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox to me - it's really something other than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's for sure is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the fried salt plums, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and then is prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could watch him here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said,
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading sleeves is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and culture there, at a time, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak one for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach escapes from danger, does that mean that he also feels afraid?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the "Edge" online magazine, contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we will enter into hard-to-practice lands because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in the face of danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes death, escapes or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduct a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our life subjective to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with the human consciousness include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and leadership and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of humans: a large part of their existence is related to language, which often means that their consciousness depends on them.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience were not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal Cortex in achieving visualization.
But what is the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we design as "poor" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the reactions of the body) captures living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imput them to others than to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is overwhelming.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is probably as likely to be felt in both cases: how can we check if rats and men feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroache runs away from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove the same experiences.
Of course, nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the origin of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to the Man: how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress has been made in the nerves to the extent that the same can be seen in rats and in humans.
As I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly forming against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platinum, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, Europe's championships," said Wasjunik.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at full speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has been constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We provided the UEFA President with a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer from them."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for the manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League was even delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignified counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulterine Dennis Quaid.
It wastes - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and the south of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his calling as unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again spoils the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would also be "regretable", that "the penalty and the disturbances of a divorce for each child be revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his response to the clap: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that works best."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flight and hotel nights would have been beneficial again - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial service and travel provider.
The company analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mostly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "describing travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economic class paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices in economic class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be weakening economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand stemmed from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Signed by the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Landing in disaster for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late into the game and his shot failed against the goal framework.
His message was precisely worded, he came out of his lips persuasively.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need this second goal", siffla Hermann Rieger in the hall of the changing rooms of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the lockers, the half-time was over, and most of them had shaved instead.
Rieger has been HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades and has a great reputation as former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
The orders of which seem to have been similar: and that jumps with this second goal!
The practice was missing.
"It wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sustained also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle of the day), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a bad victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-onset arrivals - Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen dubbed the Bayern FC - is sure to form slowly, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribble," said Jol.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
About 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index cost 10,579 points with a drop of about five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Stock Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers in the Dow Jones were at that time American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report any more profits.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs Bank account for a decrease of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial corporation that may be exchanged in a manner consistent with the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
The Courses of Pursuit in the Tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States are not at the expense of investor concerns.
The course of the action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax into the background.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the saving of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) has led to a deep deficit in the courses of Hypo Real Estate and Commercebank.
The share of Bavarian real estate financier has lost three quarters of its value at the moment despite the federal and private bank rescue operation, the Commerzbank has fallen by more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's US$700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate is scheduled to take place on October 1.
The other European fellowships also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index had a decrease of 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.

The Multinational Commercial and Tourism has also reported that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
As a result of soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they get an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravitation.
Much more, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become faster or slower unexpectedly.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
U.S. physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always thinks it's hard to do that Einstein didn't cheat and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists Removed in Egypt Are Free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese captors had required a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be undertaken.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have been communicating in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain vague: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without shouting the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing left to gather the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers had shot down on Sunday six of the captors in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to be delivered by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the captors wanted to release women's hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the captors found a safe road to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stitians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight counts for indecent acts.
Truro's High Court reported that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her and banded her before forcing her to act sexually, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, assisted National Trust volunteer, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared to have been "emotionally dead since 2006, and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a letter of confession that ended up saying, "I attached him and bandaged him regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "In particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime have been committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Department officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Office of Secrets Act, has heard of the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The lost documents contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies against invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys' 2.6 million savers.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all the companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited every year to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that the institutions that have been cautiously behaved... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Corporations, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have had a cautious behaviour during the recovery of the real estate market, must now pay for the much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to examine all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the building companies and their members from paying this bill," said Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could double.
Since the building's companies are non-shareholders, their members eventually pay the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny to one liter, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price following an increase of two pennies in February, and is the result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide if they will in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, Jersey's wholesale milk price had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail request from the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is likely to be arrested on his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail on account of his prosecution for extorting a businessman, Taka 50 million ($729.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations that have been made to him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government give her first full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he could not see why he could not remain free upon his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she do not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said counsel Rafiqueul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former Awami party leader.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges they are accused of.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But it states that it is not successful in contacting children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
One United Nations spokesman said that this occurred despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that MskyB's participation in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact aimed at preventing NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares caused doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and Ofcom's regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her share of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up her voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole came from the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain departmental officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, unsubstantiated, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of its most important recommendations.
The dispute began with the removal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to award these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," which was remarkably successful in not getting involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell song.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the London ceremony next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, moving to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heart beat became irregular, after having collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced her to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis and long-standing local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to recover Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open up in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house pâté.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Neighbourhood Owners' Committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal authorizing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a café to which the manufacturer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although society wants to take advantage of the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relook this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, pointing out that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing also that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that the name Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the inheritance of Philip Minthorne's many children's big farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The rear entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in cover of the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia"
"this place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, hazelnuts, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be set in peace.
Jérémieh Moss, who led a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (under the title "The Book of Contestations: A Nostalgic Amerement on A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow ass-de-sac, dark day and night, and bound by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the drops."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A short rat agilely at the bottom of the street, near a door that used to lead to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a beer bottle of 22 ounces empty, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown.
Some passers-by said they only rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some of the subs considered the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have unfolded in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Good as You Did. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign points out that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."This is a fact of fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program in particular supports among so many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends English language class education is in addition to his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Students in this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state exam of maths, expert level.
Likewise, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of English-language-of-arts
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, continuous capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, who is the head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language education "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were leaving without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works, she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the forecast of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, he recently considered this issue insignificant when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the English language language language.
"On the contrary, he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the educational models that work, rather than neglect them or consider them insignificant.
Net Oil Chute Follow-up to New World Economic Concerns
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial marches will fail to bring the economy back to life.
The final operations of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the profound uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on rescue, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of the Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts stated that this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement" seem to have failed to bring the market back to life."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The bank analysts reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were forced to decrease by 20 per cent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Celebration of the Team's Record Improvement.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played poorly under obscure clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranes Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of one after noon during which their relationship made a bond forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his steps to Coles.
"He's a poor player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat Cardinals' fourth back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and shot 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jet coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second or third time?"
When they told him the two - the Jets let go 21 indisputable points in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third.
"Many points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title as the best runner in the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassia had missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing- can be exaggerated in the eyes of today,- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions- sunny time, 48 degrees at the start, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie has won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The racers such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, contributed to the decline in the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters, had suffered cramps two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I am so happy," he told the reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I went there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He has been reproached in Kenya, the rival is African from Ethiopia- for having too much orchestrate his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a race track, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassia's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. in my path.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassia after the heads of the line disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made his final climb to get off Kwambai, which ended second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year reaching the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing's games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She runs using a skilled strategy, allowing the Ethiopian and Kenyan racers to take a great advantage , then exceeding about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kipp, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a town in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, just a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today."The city in five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
It is also independent, dignified, and private that it was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, does not know what he loses".
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the look on the outside.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always been a resident and the oldest parish priest in the city.
"It must conform to reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of Southist black rural culture - sometimes neglected, sometimes acclaimed - which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Such a bold case in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as all that can be used for passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who had immortalized, quoting the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people didn't like it".
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
"people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added, swinging in his back patio chair that gives Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the 20's Barnard College was buried in any grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it has offered to the world," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hudson published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted a five-way highway to replace Boulevard Kennedy, a two-way main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult time in his history.
Forced integration, among so many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the conflict over the mix of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a band of young whites came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They launched a watermelon of their car" .
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black children used to be kissed--I remember well--we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as Chief Director of the Safeguard of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because it's white--I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as her, armed with a joyful own trust and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hudson and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider her a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the contents rejected the motorway's proposal.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (referred to as well as Hurston) will open in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, rebuilt.
Today Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a back street after a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( Today there are 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville's story, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
It is necessary to ask permission for most interviews, and certain things- such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by white man, illustrating black men in the fields- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the bright red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurton considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, not better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, mad and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is much of the real civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need extra strength.
And even for younger people, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who are passing through this area will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the cyclone's eye.
They could never think only in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of work in the office" since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to falsify on sidewalks, with their wagons and muffins for morning meetings.
The Latino still hangs among the residential buildings carrying, like mules, some fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to line up to buy their morning sandwiches to street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. in the week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of noon, because I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the cashiers' window, not to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd later learn about Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all doing the tail for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called trifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in a state, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks were bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 has used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, in accounts with a value of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential shock, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that makes the most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and of her lean CEO Dick Field, with the same familiarity she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in my building uniform, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Desecrated Muslim tombs while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the " cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs illustrating red-stretched mosques.
Police accuse extreme right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said he was "deeply shocked" to the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that comes to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, as a result of its right-wing swing during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties, which won nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, as they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is prohibited from travelling abroad.
The courts banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities under his control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent had given this travel ban last Thursday after having proven to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or of his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson declared "Thursday, 25 September in the Ashford court, the Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered in the lists of sexual abuse accused.
It must inform the authorities if it wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days before its scheduled date of departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police stated that it would not discuss any particular cases or potential movements of Glitter in the container.
A spokesperson for the Kent Police said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect our children as well as those of abroad.
"in our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having served 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him into passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and therefore he was forced to leave to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on 22 August and, remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited court of jurisdiction of Uxbridge, West London, for registration on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as demanded by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for detention of child abuse images.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been prohibited from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no foreign clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers with intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivated the public.
To capture the personality moments of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Cant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a platoon camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, recalls the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographers.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits presented at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment or so.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're standing in front of people, characters you don't know or who just give you a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the 20th Street of Mata (street parallel to the People's of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true daring"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has passed through Amazonia.
The Nobel Prize Prize in Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupying it "is a real daring" and that "all demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct about 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize with the majority of the participants' voices, made the concert hall at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who had not seen the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with a great amount of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "sa thirst to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical manner" thanks to intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no means" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less like it", because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather wastes Pozoblanco Fair
The festival of the flags that ended the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreadores verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has clung to this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
At the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
Even in the afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradients applauded more than his own fight with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without merit or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was suffocated by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Control of the movement of the Basque police (Erthaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alva).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two make the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, what to stop them from.
Police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle checks on the N-1 at the border of the Armiñón Municipality.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
Police officers started pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the coast, where the two occupants went down to escape to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bullets, and then they proceeded to transfer to a police station for comprehensive inspection and weighing the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "forgery" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, it was also for this reason that they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to flee and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was put on notice to carry out the various steps and will be tried within the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson of California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "he leaned at the bottom of the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage, and going back several times, she rode on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was dropped from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested being suspected of being driven by a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat with nervous depression.
Lalamares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today it was the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing supportive treatment for his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said with regard to the behaviour of the political party that it will have to adopt in the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Mayo's Blood", Garci's bear bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "Blood of May" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures himself of having realized with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was related to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the City of Madrid constitute a "single opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the films "Captain Alastriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he was unable to turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Rear has begun" has influenced his usual way of working, on the setting up of actors, with whom he usually repeats before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larragañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Blood of May", "Seven tables of French pool" and finally the winner," "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," Garci says after more than 30 years of career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevilla dancer will pay tribute to an equally Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and Oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer in the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegan and pleads for the abolition of corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to interpret the Sévillane dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she said.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a certain way, about the life of this woman, who has exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and doesn't value her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennate
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Journal of a Poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia Triennate and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated in May and that, after traveling in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Journal of a Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the American esteem has fallen very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of his deceased elder due to an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had a hard time taking a stand against a suicidal food culture.
This huge wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us on the high pole," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious and far-reaching private life.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though opportunities were not lacking to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?", he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"For all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropic," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever attended.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes made during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the files, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move, it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there just to take the back (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that small sweaters with less fabric and then less expensive?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that it takes a long time to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which the rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind above all.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtuelle)
At the MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was introduced, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company's campus) in response to what was requested during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the place, who are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening to and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and tells him she'll be answering in a few moments.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, we talked about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will be no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to add extra functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer equipment and software to be understood.
It takes up the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can most can at least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, months clumsy, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we begin to list all its appearances, we could also mention this mustache that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a cotton, wet and sleeveless male body jersey.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his fiery name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - who has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (unrecognisable) that the best known body shirts have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of undergarments.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
At present, Sisters Cruz take their new fashion activity very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who give their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion than the Spanish sponsoring house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The 1950s and 1960s cinema enchants us and inspires us a great deal for our collections.
I love to walk around town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I believe that it is, but ultimately everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of the way I dress.
Dancers really like to dress up for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes it's at that time that you actually put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all tied up.
You've been there for not long 30 years. Was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30-year-olds are cheering me.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, besides, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Come to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
True, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very anxious and anxious, I'd like to have everything now, but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you'll think.
A few days ago you started on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
It's simply that Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity parade for her association in support of the women's support and the clothes we were displaying - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, so much is not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the dirt, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol repeaters at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative alcohol sanctions, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology Foundation for Automobile Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state, take the car back.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the haloine and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is higher than 1000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This is due only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system on school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time was the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of the night, but his rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor in order to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairway, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, all right, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or so?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is dressed very beautifully and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before going to the room where the official cortège awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city's four largest hotels, a rigorous Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price in fashion
There is certainly no place more suitable in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no living designer more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the window of Mango at 54 Haussmann boulevard in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
It is certainly the second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the next table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a mango garment and some ELA beads, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms down with his son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honour.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself at the store with a pair of pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphized by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and recalling the good old time, she seized one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's the life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening attracts us almost when he sounds every morning at 7:00, but it's even worse when we think about the pace of activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book an 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural recipes 100% that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, you may be surprised, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called sleep disorder.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night sickness (wetting) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stress or overexcitement situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or instead with screams, cries, long speeches ...
If sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that it is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (e.g., if it is related to apnea of sleep or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm indoors.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepwalks appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep, he's not aware to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you'll hear what he says, but you won't know what he's dreaming about, then pay attention to the way you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeuseern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on his field after a long period of disette.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks have created themselves the largest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had a hard time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who was rubbing the lucarne on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the climber and turn around Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Roman at the end of his foot or Diebold were to be the object of Dannemarie's defense.
In front of it, we were stuck in the middle of the field and we just left the Riahi munt at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball rested on a first attempt by Diebold (53th).
But the Illhousiens buster will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems to an Eleven Illusian who just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big dive, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to turn away from Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who severely disturbed on Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to travel Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the flight of gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation for sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firmly by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing caps of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A leaking dam was carried out on Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche facade, such as the Sands of Olonne, Vendée, where the trawlers remained at docks, or the Havre, where some twenty vessels blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting to be held in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will leave nothing" and "don't want to move to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but are of the opinion that the cost-of-profit threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel oil of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian planeboard on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats on the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains his forecast of deliveries for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, his president.
In the first half, the plane delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have flooded, is considering giving over 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has received, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper that lists sources close to the file.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate from include its International Lease Financial Corp. air lease subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been made on these transfers, FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve has granted to it at the risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders accordingly.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a fall in history Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen near 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684,81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with technological dominance, yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street broke down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan, which was intended to restore stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the representatives refused the Secretary to the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," thought Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows the extent to which the market counted in this respect," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not come "too late".
"If the project is indeed dying (...) then the relay will be transferred quickly to the Fed (the US Central Bank, Ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions further," said Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And increasing the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, pointed out Mrs. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benin, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return on the Treasury Bond at 10 years of age decreased to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the return at 30 to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner of the first TV duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, another happened to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took him.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to delay his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey Saturday gave Obama five points (49% versus 44% in McCain), considers that it was the democrat who drew his pin out of the game.
In the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septagenary McCain continued to highlight his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïvety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." did he accuse several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States around the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot derogating to the Republican not to have taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in a stormy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers."The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turn," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an old Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final eight-year verdict of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that 95 per cent of Americans would still be able to reduce their taxes despite the sobresauts of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates left out the financial rescue questions of $700 billion (€470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening from the closure of the polling stations in Minsk Central to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess not even voted: "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good use of foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by the observers as their own.
They did not follow the opposition.
"We have been forced to separate the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the decoupling," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 Presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition come into parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "we must begin dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we may become a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that had followed the electoral process would not recognize the validity of the vote.
She pointed out that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five MPs of opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returns to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - From blood to safety
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Decary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994 the Government of Canada, in the face of this tragedy and the crowd of the public, conducted a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to cease to be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started his activities, only 38% of people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and labour on the ground during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, maintains that "trust is something extremely fragile."
From its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were present in Europe.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known that a serious disease can result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been living in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was therefore refused.
However, a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique was found in the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have shorten the silent period, which extends between the moment the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," said Héma-Québec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later that last year the Chikungunya virus, like the West Nile virus, appeared on the island of Réunion, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continued Dr. Décary, noting that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide adequate supplies.
"Necessaries increase because the population ages.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network that on average only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any person in health who is 18 years of age and over meets the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they get older and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so frightful, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is covered by a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who described this program for the collection of cord blood as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they can't access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in Half-Final
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in total goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The field environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half aimlessly on both sides, the field center David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who played Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first round of the round-back series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 half-final round in total goals.
The Impact should confront the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory goal of Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to begin the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian at the dam shots in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored one goal, Plekanec amassed two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the sole purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much to do in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year
When the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, on the left, attempted to be elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was projected with images.
They circled, on three huge screens, spectacular clicks of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means as well as during the election period.
At the press stage, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the labour force with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, did not explain why the North was "a jewel with immense potential," but did not give deadlines, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At the very least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, supported by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territorial twice as large as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is within us," he insisted, as to show that he sought a national founder myth.
Quebec built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west passage, which will open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP in Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage that made the revolution quiet and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press station, he invoked another reference, conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that its deployment was planned for 2012.
"It remains between us here, but I plan to be there," he entrusted his militants to them, causing their applause nourished.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which is permitted by the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was filled, including a mission by the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto right over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pakistani chief, Pauline Marois, pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up implementing it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (selection taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented Sébastien Proulx, a replacement for Mario Dumont, who is back on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) in Harper's office, who had been able to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was an "honour" for Canada.
To blame this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves our admiration by saying as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its citizen locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to crumble under inhuman conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, among other things, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exactions.
We do not realize this yet, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps ringing and ringing so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist anymore: one can harm, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a leader of government so far minority (so it will be after October 14th...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Truth, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Libre opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In his September 17 issue, Le Dévoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the sound in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamatory prosecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining industry.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will push the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas and not by slamming.
It was therefore enough for the mining industry to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of the same audience?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to fattening lawyers paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers is doing so primarily because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a bâillon chase (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a settlement for the authors of Black Canada inciting them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in a bloc, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's far-reaching pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to her claim, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this type of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides: better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at salaries paid to the leaders of the aided enterprises.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours out of fear of the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline for opening up the markets was this morning.
The two candidates for the U.S. presidential election, who were later associated with the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, although they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they were forced to reach this end.
Senator Democrat Barack Obama has given himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to enable the owners to retain their domicile and that on the salary of the executives of the enterprises rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no way to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I've read show that this is something we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700-billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risk-active and unsold receivables of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the breakdown of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to liquidity freezes and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had put together the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this deadlock since the Democrats have agreed that some "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stating that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes to help it recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will get participation in the aided companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profit and that he can resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and severance allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Of course Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at the Congress known as "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: Congress is asked not to rush and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis in Europe.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas reported that it had failed to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are making an announcement of uncertainty."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would recover all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (755 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should have nationalized since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azur was long its good map, of some will say its weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its stink, sensitivity and talent flowing from its source will also have moved it away from the register of power that breeds the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like and whose for a long time he was a rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No self-measured, ultimate quality brand.
In the early 1950s he studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before he triumphed in theatre, television, and soon in cinema.
This same man who militates for civic rights was also the motor driver who ranked second to 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, paired with a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The dark areas of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the bursts of the show-business, will also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance has brought vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual parade mutation through it.
The charming cow boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), one evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lies Me (Hate Marked), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will resume the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he earned in 1987 his only Oscar on nine appointments.
This face across the ages was him.
Him again.
The eras flow through its course.
Young people know him mainly through George Roy Hill's cultivated Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role as a sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes Road to Loss in 2003, the loop was looped.
Against several film legends that left the trade early enough, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its facets and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "like a challenge living at "underplaying" judging his services too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles take all the cooked in the beak for a long time.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed ill-known facets of his true pudical sensitivity.
His wife, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), along with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew an end to a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of stinking and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that struck Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood drifts.
We've seen a lot of his trombling nonsense on jars of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizens model, in sum and sus.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings will begin in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been held against them, such as false and false use.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent on personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the banks of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefits were provided and thus associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books on the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the Northern Balaton Lake provincial tours, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Municipality of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and his complicit András, who, according to our information, were mainly concerned with preparing the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "research circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place restored a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently be named Együtt a Harmadik Évezredert, was guilty of forms and background errors.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
Invoice issuers with overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name Jobb Jövőért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the site hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was wrong documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Aside from the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, neither did they glue, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
In addition, there was no information on the travel agencies in Budapest, as part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. Thus, in fact, they reported travel in Hungary on cash bills, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
Overcrowding, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel services, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that "emitters" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, that the company issuing invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of incorrect invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports internship, both of which refuse to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The fraudsters also paid no attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the company's liquidator refused to issue this invoice.
Deliberate facts
Another category of invoice issuers is that made up of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifjú Szocialisták, established an invoice at the order of the Együtt Foundation a Harmadik Évezredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices in the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place, either since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has prevented organizations from mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the CEO of Delta Trió Kft., in charge of fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it could be found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have submitted documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices in the order of the Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány, and that he prevented their countervalue.
It was precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains because they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zushlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 total invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictional invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generació and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországert filed a grant application with the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for a two-fold amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a portion of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the principal defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over all history.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or possibly the socialists would have agreed that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would bear only the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be vexed, since the applications for his placement in a supervised residence, on the basis of a lightening of his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
During auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate merchandise.
The neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have successfully updated the neurological and economic foundations of this apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distant from this type of competition, such as sales on eBay, which is why they prefer even to pay too high a price.
These researches attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "play" using sales at the experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group participated in a commercial auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging process (MRI) the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale at auctions whose essential element is the auction of a third, the whole located under the brain trunk, called striatum, was in an intense way during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self-stimulation of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight to the violent response of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
At the same time, three groups oversold a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the party, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the focus was on one victory, while the other on failure.
By testing the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the player team "against failure" were willing to put higher than those performed by the control group and the "for victory" team.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary are 100 miles away, but only seven miles are treated, which is because the patients often do not know they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowish are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and organic fluid viruses (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is nevertheless recommended to be vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by a general poor condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellow, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogen destroys liver cells in a sneezing manner. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion prior to 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor who treats as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the world's day of hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by the agencies representing the sick in the four corners of the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who believes in God feel any less pain?
According to recent research results, religious belief would function as some kind of analgesic, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University had an interesting experience in analyzing how belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience is carried out in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and broadcasting electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants of the experience to look in a sustained manner two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady to the Hermine painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking either at the religious theme painting or the more general theme one.
The Catholics stated that in the eyes of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone whose "care" they took care of, and they "calmed, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, effectively change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows the believers a Madonna painted by Léonard or a painter of the same size?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary cause better results?
You're what you're divulging about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of people's pocket in the same title as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centers of interest.
However, it is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics setting up a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they do not see the bulk of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their original goal that sounded as follows: "We collect all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global tidal work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What would I do tomorrow?" or "What would be my best job?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, on the day when they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all netizens that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned with human rights have been able to raise a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with the EFF electronic legal protection agency, has proven its right to the court in the face of the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years before. But ultimately, it failed to obtain the lists of private user searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that is manifested against multinational societies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "sauvageons" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invading world because of Windows, and that, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its identification code users, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in view of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word in recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: one is exposed.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These kids can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of her employees, nothing but for the honest opinions that she wrote on her blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
He who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows himself, and so one can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not fewer. Google services online, passing through text processing to image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed to date.
Public opinion expects, without really hiding itself, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasingly high rate lead to serious migraine not only in Microsoft, but also in many other IT program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all of this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after the company has considered the multiple daily restoration too costly, taken at any time. All this seems to be hilarious next to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that harm the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What's about is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble before its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a dazzling way only through Google data.
Two minors helped eliminate the traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of Ózd's double murder. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the Borsod department.
Young people have recognized the facts that are being reproached, and for the moment, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder may result in a detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a young man from 23 years old, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and for this reason he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as that man's 9-year-old girl.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw stock exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krona, to buy 100% of the Prague stock exchange package.
Ludwik Sobolowski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market experts.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, increasing daily, the leading newspapers of the European press are already referring to a "second September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the President of the United States" - accuses the daily life of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the life, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as spoke of billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the El Mundo daily vision, it was the failure of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the price for it.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real danger, the one that Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - the Tages-Anzeiger de Genève highlights.
Some states may still hold a lifeboat to their titubant financial agencies, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to do little about their national selfishness, and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Friday daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, runs through the old continent from part to part.
"Savitors" must not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noticed in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
Intelligent Car Imitates Bourdon Flight · Global Voices
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the bourdonating bees gave the strategic idea of departure to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-robotized control system, of the BR23C type, which he equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flight, each bee is its own space, of oval shape, which actually resembles much of our secure protection hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The facet eye of the bee plays a vital role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the functions of the facet eye, the engineers discussed the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Contrary to any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place in an instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," says Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, it was only possible to use the rotating movement, acceleration and slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and the energy concentration is higher, making their life span longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive smart reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the capacity to store.
This mechanism should only treat some incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. Thus, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a giga-bytes capacity, not even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entrance into the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the 700 billion-dollar economic rescue plan to redeem the bank's doubtful credits, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further discussions going on until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congressional leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which there is no more to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. Pelosi said that there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington Local Time (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to Central European Local Time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made this evening, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for the White House.
In addition, the programme differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which noted that the $700 billion had to be spent on one occasion, for the redemption of securities on doubtful credits.
In the future, up to half of the 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will serve the Treasury Secretary to buy suspicious bank receivables, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious debts, mortgages, and other types of "toxic" debts.
The department's competent persons stated that purchases may take place in the context of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of suspicious debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of any major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready to apply the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect that their start-up allowances, simply called the gold umbrella out-of-Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
Salary cap is mentioned only in very specific cases. Furthermore, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat proposes its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys out in an auction, they will collect a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns the new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force for the deputy generals' additions - commented the chairman of the Board of Deputies' financial benefits committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State is granted a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be earned in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were, of course, those who expressed doubts about this plan.
It is not for this reason that the American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes that they are the same ones who are pressing for action, as do those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry increased by 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the sectors of supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial exploitation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas introduced by the authorities since 1 July.

Next year, do we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that, by January 12, the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs has declared in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
She said, "now, everything depends only on the time when the non-Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service."
At times, she drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry visa in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary the decoration of the Cross, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the government's $700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had entered into agreements of principle on the rescue of banks.
This funding plan, with the objective of the thawing of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more qualified than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead of it. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a cholistier just after the republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote the law on the 700 billion rescue plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages which he also supports.
"It is now necessary to act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas of out-of-the-counter.
In an interview given to the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but not doing anything is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Board and the capping of senior officials' departure allowances, and that he was, personally, very attached to these issues.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is what Der Spiegel refers to, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took on its duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU gathered 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devorating its parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they have been strongly wrong about the pace. However, secularization, educational results and the establishment of Germans from the north and the east in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the independents, artisans, the owners of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? The party presidents stand on the reservation to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, and now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, party leaders barely let their cards come across.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to discuss with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice Chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an entirely open matter, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, the host of which is France, as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fides European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and thus, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fides Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during the contracts, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, following their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of Roma youth do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic right of the human being plays a key role in upholding other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the Euro-Deputy, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between the Roma and non-Roms.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"By virtue of their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - said Lívia Járóka.
In the honourable Member's view, there is a need for cooperation from the European Union aimed at an objective, and action is needed to speed up the disintegration process of schools, so compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and preparation is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and joblessness. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held each year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the fall of Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a loss of a catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the Congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair felt, in any case, that they did not hold specifically at their headquarters.
As a result, they worked to calm down the angry members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength left.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of the party's internal readjustment, the Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, has also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates talks with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of destiny was that using the Free Electors list, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then without planning the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the threads in the backs, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will once again be a chance only if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the land loss of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to the illegalities committed during the vote.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 people in that country of 10 million people has been very opposed for decades before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously expected that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of a few MPs of the opposition to the parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian anti-democratic political order, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit for the reduction in imports of Russian natural gas, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the Beltransgaz company, owner of gas pipelines across the country, went to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on failures, such as the ban on one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a pre-arrangement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the vote.
Despite all of this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia. But, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," Alexandre Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, although "the power has been frightened in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not provide for action to protest in the light of the results; rather, it tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the old people's circle," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees no longer considers it really appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is no longer a matter of time" - Milinkevitch estimates.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers described the democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." Thus, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had no turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in effect against the young smarts, against who points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-foliating news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors," Brunetta says, "are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presences and more services," said the Minister.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta added.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees has been recorded, the Secretary General assures: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister informs that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including wage dynamics - explains the Minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is now expanding the data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness-writing the association of consumers- the people of the "active farmers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees gathered to declare war against the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of disability due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence hours of the sick worker, during which inspection visits are made, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Central prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data broadcast by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of workplace prevention," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilates and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing joint effort towards prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion.
"Naturally outraged, everyone has hit a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, because of their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed how much this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all the institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The accident data on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive" later stressed the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "disqualification" to translate in fact into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"We have pointed out that Mercandelli-more checks and inspections are necessary, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added - "An additional effort must be made to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Markandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for the protection of workers' benefits" and "the drift of assistance to which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the destiny of the person who has an accident, should not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listen to full volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is announced by the European Commission, which, in a communiqué published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such an important number of young people who frequently use portable music and mobile phones at full volume can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"According to scientific data, the EU is still at a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this public domain information.
We must also review existing monitoring systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientifics-concludes the Executive EU- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures might possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concern increases as regards hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits of the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during extended periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Therms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when completed, the Committee and the Council will assess the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it would like to stress Germano - should propose ideas for the development of Rome to be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappears, as this experience must have a precise time period.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its views will not be binding, Germano replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by day-to-day and emergency management that occurs from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman citizens a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "there is a need for a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit," he said.
A future that, the Mayor of Rome, "will not be confined to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to become an independent politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president of the anti-American world.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections draws closer.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is really polite: he believes that he will gain the highest position of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are of course racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, who all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, on the outskirts of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting on the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning map for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back to her by foot to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the point of Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge stain to fulfill.
Usa, the economic shock is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time of suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were interrogated by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare themselves to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the assembling of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it, it does not reduce itself significantly.
An obvious more complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are passing to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest acroc in American journalism lies among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "work safety".
Directors who think they lose their jobs in the three-year period are 47 per cent at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going at 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 miles a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years have passed.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "diseased" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS STILL GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During his trial last week, he was released from his residence as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel the city of the province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a large number of Americans were, and still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is well the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its early East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington Party" and the world of finance, particularly powerful in the states of the Centre and the South.
The soul, precisely, which made itself feel despotically with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just one example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is predicting or already leaves to run: not only to the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have occurred for some time, to such an extent that in the new climate they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary revival, of the dual sovereign state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of financial-banking institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play, or it does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and the various national strategies, does not come to a decision on any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a feeling of credit: when we go through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever have in a similar manner.
This new emphasis on the state-of-the-nation crisis is, of course, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a fairly related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather little material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more maps than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadows.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacies, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now to their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, fed underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolutions" or, in the changes of the collective moods of the latter recently, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, their format, would say someone, have ever more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially in a disproportionate manner.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The Study- The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nano tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos' legs, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "detach easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARKING ON MURS? –" this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibre like hair, which self-cleans dust during the movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because vitamin-rich and savoury, if associated with some vital drugs, alter the amplifying or decreasing absorption as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nayey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, undoing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - The Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year information bulletin, warned doctors and patients not to assess the risks arising from this mixture and to be careful about drinking, taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba's appeal, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan: "these discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert at the Ansa Agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Kenyan who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered many controversy, and which was reproached by the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive communicator", particularly critical of the excess liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost one year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the public with various new features: the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and became less austere, to other important ones, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrids" documents that combine the typical Adobe-format chart with elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflict on the changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD may be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a means of spreading it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's equivalent video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, third-class, and winner of the best climber jersey.
It's the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl testes are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positiveness of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to force two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus stalking the best climber's peas jersey.
IMMIGORS:New YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RATE?
Italy "as a Country of Emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is about, who dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who came from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we record" more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the largest support for the Northern League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendence emphasized by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market doesn't know about crisis
According to the last survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a simple room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories of young people, the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin have to support," explains Sunia's head of study, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market so that a generalized increase process has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, no rent limit, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
In detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 euros (Blackband area), at an average value of 800 (Lambate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Smaller values (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other universities (Ostian and Cinecittà).
You can only save yourself if you stay away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 euros for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rents are often taken by extra community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities choose historic halls.
The historic cinema halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large halls, and the death of consumption of the mono halls in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that we find inevitable and undeniable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical and memory-filled places, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a side of the road and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the traders, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is leading with 82 cinemas mono halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms t that the first responsible for their disappearance is the event of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sall cinemas: 195 screens plus in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as Emilia-Romagne.
"Italian exploitation has grown irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is still necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a living room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mayor and Anec, the first of that kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas of the historic centres and the outskirts.
The proposed regulations include tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and special parking rates will be available in some parking lots and parking lots.
"This is an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
However, it is clear that in order to contrast the superpower of multiplex, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise Cinema" to which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side not to see the blackboards by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the Mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the Directorate antimafia de la Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia Association.
The handcuffs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son lawyer, homonym of the boss, already convicted for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a confrontation with legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been given to the clan - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the regional committee Agazio Loero, only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of drangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those of July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As of late April, Gioia Tauro's communal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He screamed at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior of the time, Marco Minniti, the accuser of having handled everything for a political issue, but given the application for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm wrote, it emerged "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representative of a better-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of waves, now the big ones are starting .
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have set eyes, and now try to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in line with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the ecological bodies and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity demand could be covered by sea hoop operating systems.
This amount would double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and tides..
Coloses to the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was the Energysis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a true revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these traditional energy companies have been putting on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal - and evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, say observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at its beginning, on the part that marine energy does not dispel fears about the ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major ecosystem problem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies need to be used with a higher ecological impact.
"And choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of muds connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the mud upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six marine turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to pull energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, is currently worth the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look at the coasts, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and forecast investments of up to 35 million in 2009.
