Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for alleged involvement of it in a massive pattern of corruption concerning Petrobras State oil company.
The Office of the Federal Prosecutor said that Jose Dirceu will be sued for allegations of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other fourteen people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former and services for Petrobras businesses.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers' Party taken into custody for connections to this scheme.
Dirceu served as former head of firm and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said that Dirceu developed the Petrobras bribe-taking scheme, accepted bribes while they were in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after being closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the purchased votes.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately 2 billion dollars in the form of bribes and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also be included bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for swollen contracts.
Recovery of the “miraculous” and a survivor of the Peshawar massacre
A teenager who was paralyzed after being shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack succeeded in a dramatic recovery and after undergoing treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, aged 13, told the doctors in Pakistan that he could never go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army in December last year.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for the operation, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in the morning of Tuesday, Mohamed was sitting at the time of his first aid and listening carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven men armed and disguised in the uniforms of security officers enter the public school of the army.
They wore explosive belts and had to perform a simple mission: to kill all men, women and children who were on their way.
“I can’t forget what happened that day and tell Mohamed with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunfire outside.
The terrorists entered and began to kill. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was being carried out.
Then he says he heard his friend Hamza screaming.
Say \"oh, brother, save me and
I held it by my hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he fainted so that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the lower arm.
Doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then those in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he could never go again.
\"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out and said to Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistan's television, attracting the support of famous people like Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as terrified and when he arrived at the hospital.
\"He spent the last few months in bed without being able to move from one side to the other,\" says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in very good shape.
A vertebrae from the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, in the hip and in the back during the attack, and the lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during an operation that lasted six hours, Malik and his team managed to re-read the nerve endings and rebuild the ruined part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the surgery, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We weren't expecting such a good outcome.
It was a miracle and he says it.
In less than two weeks after the surgery, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, enlist in the army and fight terrorism.
\"I feel I still have a chance to live and he says, showing the weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but psychological trauma that he's going through now is unimaginable.
\"My fury didn't go down and confess it too.
In my school, little children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, soothes the grown man and says: “I see my son walking again and
He'll be able to keep his life straight.
4G and Three’s Super Voice Service provides better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
The Mobile Phone Provider Three launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and in rural areas without signal.
Super Voice 4G service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as the Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE) and
This currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, a million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than so far and
The views are ready for the pantomime stage
The pantomime stage is very important for theatres across the UK, many of them now preparing for this year's internship.
Now, some of the biggest names in the show business are participating at the Christmas theater.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in the Cinderella - the first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and the second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal their pantomime secrets at the BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty and
Steven Wilson has recently been designated as the great winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most successful musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album an intelligent, expressive and captivating work of art
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many more musical projects, the most well known of them being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transitence, to show the more accessible side and his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love of vinyls and his busy program and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry opened his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up during the growth of the vinyl era and I remember that then I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a record, went home, had a scratch and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, such as classic music, are better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing to really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
There's something you can hold in your hand while you get absorbed in the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but there's no way to know if too young chicks remember vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyls that you especially have?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started from the idea of re-establishing the collections I was 15 years old, but I crossed that line.
The first disk I convinced my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the initial copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it's somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a gateway to potential new fans
Why did you launch your new Transition compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the day of the record stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of discourse suggested that I gather some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I got to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something gender-introduction in Steven Wilson's music and I always held the project to be released only on vinyl.
Anyone who buys the wine also receives a variation downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music pieces, there's one thing I've always prized above anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put the accent on the melodic and the atmosphere.
What are you doing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want him to reveal much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first, it will be a version of the Hand. Erase show that we had this year, but steroids, with a few invitations.
The second night will rather be an incursion in my history, it being oriented more towards the fans who followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open his show the second night?
And I and the others on the tournament team are big fans of [the comedy serum on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always quote from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and I asked him to sing at Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You remixed albums of some bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that influence your own music?
I do not consciously inspire myself, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that we remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I was working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world who don't proudly say that, because please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an ethics of incredibly strong work.
If I don't do anything for a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why working at remixes was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
Music industry is a tough place to run a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work daily and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I'd been lazy and I don't think I would have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will play at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European tournament.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans hired part of the airline's staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the refurbished company in northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the natural gas company QGC, meaning 18 crew members have regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.
Famine made several communities face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliament for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of national-liberal government criticism.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, re-released the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline's contract with QCG has already created jobs.
“We managed to realign 18 members of Skytrans personnel with full-time, pilots and crew members and he said.
We are also delighted to have a new staff with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we've grown up with 100% workforce, 78 staff members being employees in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to expand its flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which holds Cape York and the Torres Strait, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC staff and entrepreneurs from Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its Dash-8 aircraft of 36 seats, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, CEO of the QGC, said that Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
\"We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland and he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high and consistent quality flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentarian and fresh Mama Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a greater supply of milk to avoid losing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women are going to be in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be vested months and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, received the advice to make a greater reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding from intervening in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's head of discipline, Scott Buchholz, who subsequently consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a breast-feeding parliament, in accordance with the laws in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter Olivia.
According to the existing ordinances - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - mothers who breastfeed get a vote in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before consulting with the opposition leader, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer was unable to attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just started breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliament was planning to make her a higher milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, a Queensland Parliamentary, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two settled their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was furious when she was told to make a greater supply of milk instead of nursing her daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working to make up his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national parliament in Queensland, was promoted as a leader of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the vote on censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the image with Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
Former disciplinary officer Phillip Ruddock was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a censorship motion in which he wanted his removal from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed responsible for deputy discipline.
Nickolic had recently held the first page of the newspapers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message in which he asked him to give up on Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter Olivia was born in May.
He is one of the three parliamentarians who have become mothers this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that the vote for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
“Now she’s [seven years] and she wrote it on Twitter.
The person responsible for the discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wanted more women in his cabinet.
“No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the whole country and told the Prime Minister in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet, after the rebooting of December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull may have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, the lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to show more enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's brakes as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he just got into a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's political style, \"crash-or-crash-through\" and \"abbott\".
Representatives of interest groups spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly awaits the country's biggest companies and their representatives from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set as the objective of starting the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech announcing on the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) was the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized the revolting economicism and the Labour Party's concern about that problem and expressed concern and the racist temptation of criticism.
\"In the context of ChAFTA, the winners are, numerically, much less than the losers and he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the entire senate.
Minister for Small Business Bruce Billson supports the Harper Analysis recommendations.
This could lead from the beginning to certain divergences with the business environment.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.
It is called an impact assessment and because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drafted is extremely important for the outcome.
The Harper analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the great retail traders.
Turnbull now makes sense that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped to burn to say that if Turnbull follows Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that has advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do to him by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women aged between seventy and eighty years.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced the probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard thinks I totally misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in the Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't believe that one times one is equal to one.
\"How to be equal to one and he said it.
If one or one makes one, it means that two has no value, because one or the other has no effect.
One time one makes two, because the square root of the four is two -- so what is the square root of the two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers did not agree with his theory, so he resigned to Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
\"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong and he explained it.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the designation of \"Terryology\"
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory one times one and the other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional infinite-form scaramids, connected to one another with copper wire or magnetized wires.
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 (Systems and methods for improved applications by building bricks.
Also, the president's actor On the trail of an idol and says Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would freak out if they saw Terryology.
And you know and he says, we've wondered since I was three-four years old why a bubble takes round shape and
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the entire course of education.
\"This will be the last century that our children will learn that one or one will do one and he said.
They will no longer be required to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years from now, they'll know that one or one makes two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Printing
Tuesday, during the show “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing \"Mary Had of Little Lamb and Spears, then showing her vocal qualities with The Wheels on the Bus and singing with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did good work imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of the Can't Feel My Face file and of The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name was still on the press.
On the same day you were at \"Good Morning America\" and where you opened the show with the gogoa lingo incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the restaurants “Cantina and where it will be used will become points of interest to urban
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the fast food restaurant chain in Mexican style will open a new location in the Chicago Wicker Park area, offering a tapas menu of appetizers, a fresh painting by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the restaurants \"Taco Bell Cantina and the chain, which addresses young people, increasing concentration in number in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, ready fast, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a 7 USD average Taco Bell payment note, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
However, Taco Bell states that, in order to address the new generation that seeks more central urban environments in which to live, to work and to have fun and the testing locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can make a drive-through, you need the field.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acru of land in an area like Wicker Park?
\"Don't allow yourself and told the USA EVERY Neil Borkan, the Frankish Taco Bell who will operate the location of Chicago.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where I can see food on my own before it is ready, said to Associated Press Meredith Sandland, Head of Development at Taco Bell.
Wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will also be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer evening menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of about 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company said another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an inside yard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers outside of those looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when it inaugurated Cantina menus and more expensive burritos, to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that until 2022, he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland said for the AP, several hundred of them will be \"Cantines\" type
Elton John's courting with Putin.
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night, only a few days after the British artist publicly declared that he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the anti-Russian legislation together.
The British gay singer, declared, unsuccessfully tried to get a meeting with Putin while in Russia in November 2014, a year after challenging the protests in this country and supported two concerts in 2013, in an agitated period in the history of that state, after the adoption of controversial laws that ban homosexual propaganda in the minority.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made before fans the following statement: “Although I am gay, I always felt that I am well received here in Russia and
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I wouldn't be able to compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for that, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist decided that he wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone discussion of the two personalities.
Cocos was also gaining momentum in the ANRP folder
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a harsh conviction, chanting and in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday's hearing at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the dossier in which he is tried by his son or Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and by the former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Disaggregations under the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped Gheorghe Stelian business in the case of the APRAs, instead demanding to be judged faster and to take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was engaged with it after several real estate businesses.
He said Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at the ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice-president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him the money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in several trances.
I promised him political support to stay in line.
\"Diacomatu then told me that he was helping me, but that he needed support and showed Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that later, through a knowledge, he came into contact with the Dumitrean Crime, who was then the head of the Central Commission of Dispagubiri, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
The Dumitrean Creed a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave it 800,000 euros.
I need all this money to be given in the trances, to make sure the file is solved.
\"So I said, to solve the file, to put aside and showed Cocos.
Asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I met Alina Bica.
“I never talked to this about money or land and showed Cocos.
He also pointed out that the country of fame that all members of the ANRP had met before the meeting.
I didn't have any emotion that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politically.
\"I told him that I was helping him politically just to keep him quiet and ended Cocos' statement.
The bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Premier Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file \"Turceni - Rovinari\"
Victor Ponta fled DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is researched for false in inscriptions under private signature, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he could have sent by counsel.
It wasn't so, the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents on the record.
I wanted to state (on file, no.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to see both of us, because as long as the taxes have been paid, it's okay.
“From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, of course, for all the countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here and said Prime Minister Victor Ponta at the exit of DNA.
Ponta further stated that the decision of the European Court, if we are members of the EU, should apply from the point of view.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call him back to the hearings, but to give him an answer to his requests, including the removal of the file.
Iohannis enjoys his term without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision that forces you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a machine, since you pay your TV fee with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is assumed that the position of President of Romania is also included in the connection to everyday realities.
President Iohannis was confounding himself every day in total silence in the office or in the Cotrocenes
Only, to the astonishment of even his closest men from the Cotrocens Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after he doesn't watch television - no programs, no even at the German posts RTL or Pro Sieben -, the president doesn't listen to the radio posts and he doesn't read the papers.
In addition, it does not receive even negative monitoring and that, for example, the predecessor or a priority requirement.
Instead, Iohannis is happy to only receive the report of the news that puts it in a positive light.
And next to this informational self-isolation, in which the only breach is the facebook access, much more serious is the blocking to which, through its passivity, the head of the state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so bitter since its installation, Iohannis hasn't signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the Presidential Administration's employees yet.
What becomes an increasingly serious problem, both from a human point of view and from a legal point of view.
Quietness and peace
Those in the presidential corner are already clear that no one and nothing can ruin the shui and the head of state's office.
Where it is quiet and peace.
What's right, only after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former Sibi building demands the presence of officials.
A habit that probably didn't get rid of when he was leading the primary town on Cibin.
And the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in the office has already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotrocene Palace who have come to lean towards the variant that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially that he doesn't have a radio device.
Only that, at this rate, they follow to meditate as soon as they are in the dark, because lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just for the good
Also, another strangeness from the Cotrocene Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the psych monitor and the activity of the president.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of the state will get its contents on bioru.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was banned from negative monitoring and under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognised not only as a result of the night television broadcasts in which he was criticized, but demanded each morning, with priority, negative news.
That doesn't mean you helped him with something, but that's what the gesture matters!
And at least he can never have the excuse that he was not well informed from alternative sources.
No outside, no confirmation
Now, eventually to love her and the mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, whatever the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees in the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the State in charge and who must bear his signature.
Only that, from December to now, Klaus Iohannis did not sign for confirmation or at least half of these statements, although this was to happen in no more than 30 days.
Thus, hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotrocene Palace, now have an uncertain situation.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be kicked out.
Only that all of them didn't get any negative opinion!
So, I mean, I can come whenever the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will notice that over half a year, so many people have received their salaries at least somewhere at the edge of the law.
That until they decide and the president if he gives them out or confirms them on posts, the decision being his strict.
Authorities stated that a teenager was launching an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather aspirational than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities broke the plan.
The plan is also referred to by the Texas Representative, Mike McCaul, the President of Internal Security, during a Sunday interview, said a source for Fox News.
\"We closely monitor the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States and said McCaul to the \"This Week\" and to the ABC.
Pope Francisc was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
Joint information from the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, stating that the adolescent was planning to use fewer attackers, firearms and explosives, having as a foreign dignitary target during a high-level event and
The newsletter mentions that the minority has radicalized through social networks.
The adolescent may suffer from a mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man's disease.
On Sunday, McCaul also acknowledged the potential for an attack by a solitary president and the entire nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a strictly secret place and for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great security risk... but as the date approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect it when it reaches the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say.
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The Collooney Fag, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, lighting up the macabre view of a skeleton trapped between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze remains, thus discovering a frightening story.
“He was brutally killed and told Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
On the upper side of the chest has wounds caused by the knife. There's such a trail in his left hand, which suggests he's trying to defend himself.
The sketch is from a young man between 17 and 20 years of age.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
“We can’t know if he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute and says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
\"Probably he was buried by family or community and added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
“It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one and she said it.
There are historical documents that testify that in the area there was a church and a cemetery, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect to the discovery: the height of the young man.
\"It was 1 meter 77 and says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what little children think about food.
The project, called “The Way in which babies and young children perceive food and are run by the University of Chicago and, so far, has established that the young are not prepared to eat food that is clear from other people or that they have strangled other people.
According to the project funder, nutrition is important for health and longevity, but Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets.
There is evidence to suggest that early feeding patterns of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of the whole life.
The premise for this study is that there is a lack of research into how babies look at food.
\"Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have given surprising attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food to babies and young children.
Researchers say about babies and that they have limited knowledge in the field of food and
Children between the ages of three and six years and have more about food than babies and young children, but they are \"extremely consumers of mofturo and
An actress who played in Star Trek: Voyager and is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series “Star Trek: Voyager and was arrested in eastern Tennessee, being accused of exposing herself to children.
Several media channels report that the 41-year-old actress Jennifer Ann Lien, who played Kes's role in the television series, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on 3 September, at Lien's house in Harriman, where they say they found her empty under a blanket on the couch.
Officers said that Lien refused their requests to dress.
Chief of Police at Harriman, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's got several heads of charges, including aggravated bodily injury, after the April incident in which he says Lien entered a police car with his personal car.
It still doesn't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose broken body was discovered in a tourist forest has been identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest, northeast of London.
The Turkish man of origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body was probably in the Epping forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the metropolitan police, said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist place, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat walking.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspected activity to come and discuss with us.
Super Chief: Six women juggle between maternity and service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo executive director Marissa Mayer announced she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and work during and during her free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that expected the superfemale or nothing.
But mayer, herself and a symbol of the top woman, be to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women's leaders doing?
Seema Patel, Deputy Lawyer and Director of the San Francisco Labor Standards Office, just got a government job in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss amazed her with unexpected advice.
\"I don't know anything about you and she told her boss.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, get ready to get your leave from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't get even a maternity leave day paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was unmarried and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing she thought about.
But she listened to her chief's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she had three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when Patel was born the second child, Patel couldn't apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
“It seems very discouraging to anyone trying to have a family and she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't put any value on becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any woman employed as a mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between the quality of the mother and the job as a constant battle and
The secret to not sink is to have an incredible family next to you and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that you won't be the best (not everyone can be Martha in inner settings and just go through it.
Choi says he's taken an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, has a fever, vomiting, and you stay up all night to look after him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated and says it.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry, after the university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she said.
Today, about 90% of them have quit.
Women who give up the job, then start again do not have the same chances at top positions paid well, she says.
It is difficult to stay: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move on is that I would want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientist and teacher Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know that their mother is actually helping to save lives.
Posner, founder and director of Columbia University's Risk Assessment Centre, says that it is important for women to know that they can have a higher objective and career and fulfil it.
It's very important for women to think they can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow you to believe that and say it.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when he was pregnant in eight months.
It also helped the technology, she says, because she can stop the car from answering her phone after taking her children or responding to an e-mail from going.
The juggling between maternity and an applicant career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to good and even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, CEO of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that to make maternity and career work together only through private help networks, such as vouchers, is wrong.
“You should not get lucky or know at the lottery to succeed and say it, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, deficit health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
“As a society, we don’t take care of each other and say it.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who have just been born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, was born while the first scholarship.
With a husband and child based on the health care offered by the scholarship, the job leader was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that more and more women will abandon their profession if they will receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining agreed programmes and accepting that effective work does not mean staying over the program.
At the forefront of the logistical constraints, Mosko says, there is additional pressure to work in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitomism of lack of taste (tummy shawls and represents one of the most serious insults).
“Imagine is part of our job — it raises or pulls you down and explains it.
“Permanent shop and Mosko’s shop for its multiple roles to work harmoniously means to maintain its appearance and a beautiful bag in his hand, from which, however, sometimes one toy will fall.
If you remember that men are also yours, society might allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, the president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who deals with the dwelling of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that motherhood and career do not mean talking about \"balance\"
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks rather like a swinger and says it.
Mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
“It was a very important time for the agencies and explains it.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so she could breast-feed her baby.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning at 6 p.m. (more cheap as therapy and still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a friendly environment for parents and where delay due to a child is allowed, and the response to e-mails should not necessarily be sent from the office.
“The concept and the concept of family have changed and it changes a lot and says Olatoye.
“The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago.”
The workplace is the one that needs to adapt.
Humor and Russians say they tricked Elton John about a call from Putin
For the cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of the sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram where the Russian leader thanked him for addressing him on the issue, it immediately became clear that whoever called him Monday night, it was certainly not Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he did not know about that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two humours and famous Russians admitted that they, not the presidents, had been foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
“We thought that it was likely that Putin wanted to meet with him or call him, or at least not soon, and said VladimirVovan and Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei and Lexus and Stoliarov, was appointed as the spokesman for the president’s speech, Dmitri Peskov.
“On the other hand, it seems that Elton John really expected this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people that we were giving and he said for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said: \"Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.\"
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most exciting of my life.
As a way to unravel John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on farce speculations.
On the basis of the stories, there are comments that made the song in the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his racist and homosexual attitude while militating for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of \"propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations and among minors.\"
“I would like to meet [with Putin], to talk and told John to the BBC, saying that, although the idea was probably unrealistic and deserved a try.
Then, Monday evening, the singer raised the confidence of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said he was looking forward to meeting [fish] and finally discussing LGBT equality in Russia and
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, also known for the jokes of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and pretended to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists Tuesday that Putin would be ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions and however that at Kremlin no such request was received from the singer.
Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the position on Instagram, he added, especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English and
We don't think that Sir Elton John would have written such grammatical mistakes.
Even before the Russian duel declared its public farce, local media channels already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment had identified him as guilty on Krasnov, known for the farces made by politicians with phones he records and post them on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in jokes to public, then the publication of the recordings has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered himself the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to make them farces to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerashenko, the direct adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashenko so well that last year he spoke to Dnipropetrovsk's former governor, Ihor Kolomoski, more than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, then president's advisor Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the president of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, his victims included former and former USSR Mihail Gorbachev, Kiev mayor and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him to apologize for his athletes' drinking behavior.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko, giving himself the son of the late Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovici.
It was so convincing, that the person at the end of the other person, whose voice resembled Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin provoked a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on \"propaganda and told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with such an irrelevant habit and that he was ready to meet him with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered such a meeting to damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that fewer people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die prematurely from outdoor air pollution, less than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal for heating and cooking, but research reveals that an alarming reason is the agricultural emissions from Europe and the USA, which is the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
“These projections should draw an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world and said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.
These cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three-quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research has not included the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the paper Nature, is the first to highlight various sources of air pollution from abroad and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel-based plants and other sources.
Researchers used a detailed computerised model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how it affects pollution on Chinese and Indian inhabitants.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of fumes, such as wood and coal, for heating the dwellings or cooking, and of the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised dangers.
Consumption of this type of internal energy results in half of India’s 645 000 annual deaths and a third of China’s 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, research has found that agricultural ammonia emissions have had a remarkable impact according to Professor Jos Leveld of the Max Planck Chemical Institute in Germany, which led the research.
A fifth of the global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from the excessive use of fertilizers.
The ammonia reacts with the exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main reason for death due to air pollution in eastern USA, Japan and Europe.
“For London, agriculture is the main source and says Levieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of the premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This caused only 5% of the deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the power plant, in particular by coal-operated plants, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
The US is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in dry and dusty regions, has caused nearly a fifth of the deaths globally caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, accounting for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
“The overlap between high levels of pollution and the large number of inhabitants speaks about public health, but there is nothing left about pollution sources responsible for premature deaths,” Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health globally.
All particles are now supposed to be as toxic.
However, if fuel burning results are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both by scientists and policy makers.
Dr. Oliver Wild, a specialist in the atmosphere at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really underlines the need for air quality control, in order to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia and
Victor Ponta's statement tenses and more relationships with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop with lies, the first novel speaks of attitudes that remember Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after the Serbian border, experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities in Budapest on Monday that he was treating refugees with a beating and
The Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly by speaking of the claims of \"extremist and lying\" and but not even Victor Ponta left it any lower and accused government officials in the neighbouring country as a disgrace to Europe.
Notably, it is not for the first time when Ponta is trying to strain the Roman-Hungarian relations through statements made at delicate or electoral times.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania can not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
It's your problem with our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not the way our neighbors treat our Hungarians, with their beatings inserted.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has set himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our task to solve the problem.
\"We'll treat those people as we did and said Victor Ponta, quoted by the Truth Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the center of critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that probably the internal political crises that shook Victor Ponta's position make him make statements \"extremist and lying\" and
The Romanian pregnant woman in Budapest was summoned to offer explanations, inform mediafax, citing MTI.
\"Mr. Victor Ponta recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigration crisis and specifies the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Levante Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed his surprise and concern for Victor Ponta's constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-unity lies and underlines Budapest's diplomacy.
“I do want to answer the challenges that come from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation I feel, as a European man and citizen, about the attitudes and attitudes that Europe has only seen in the 1930s-40s!!! and wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, just like other European politicians, he has the authority and will draw attention and sanction and constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary who are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union and to the anti-Semitic and minority attitudes of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis and
\"Sarma jimpata, aggressive laws, imprisonments and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are policy-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries of which the refugees are fleeing, accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values and what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction just with these objectives and values.
In the course of the evening, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where Hungary constituted the main subject.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers were to shoot or kill some children or women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the dispute also appeared President Kelemen Hunor, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a sentimental confrontation with Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.
The UDMR leader claims that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roman citizens, he shows that the fence could even help our country not become an intense route transited by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, I mean, that we don't have to hysterize, take this whole thing as something against Romania and we don't have to use it to aggravate anyhow the bad relations between the two governments, because that's not the case.
I think any sentimental, visceral approach isn't right.
“We need to see the rational part, see why we got here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Romanian citizens and does not prevent free circulation between the two states, within the EU and said Kelemen Hunor.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to sidetrack Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has proposed more than 3 years ago the enlarging of President Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to an official high involved at that time in negotiations with the doors closed between the western lands and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers have not taken advantage of the proposal since then.
From 2012 until now, tens of thousands of people have died and millions have had to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (U.S.A., United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churchill, offered a plan that included Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the beginning of the peace treaties between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
“We need to look for an elegant way to get away from Assad and told Ahtisaari, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, the Great Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was about to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
“It was an opportunity lost in 2012 and continued former President of Finland.
Russia officially strongly supported Bashar al-Assad throughout the four years and half of the war, insisting that his entourage could not represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad considers that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun to send troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize the regime of Assad and to attack the extremists of the Islamic State.

Reports show that populations of animals and marine plants have been half over the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis faced by animals and marine plants is documented in a detailed study stating that marine species across the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions to the global ocean ecosystem combine and create an age of difficulty for almost all marine lifers, says the report \"WWF's Blue Planet Life\".
Coral reefs are seriously at risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercial fish, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertigo by three quarters and by the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acid continues to get worse, as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
\"The healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy and said Louise Heaps, the Chief Marine Policy Advisor at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
\"To fish in excess, which deteriorates coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we resemble seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe and says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the London Zoological Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Almost 20% of the total mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great diversity of marine species, from fish, frogs and sea turtles - a wormlike animal with harsh skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the areas of algae have decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas have decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused enormous damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
It takes profound changes to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations and said Marco Lambertini, director-general of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in species fishing for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macrou, tone and sardine - fell 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a fishing race that could end with the deprivation of people from a vital source of food and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities based on the sea will be hit the fastest and strongest and Lambertini said.
“The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and undernutrition and continued it.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and are clearly warning about the problems we might face as a result and
Sea grass: long grasses and submarines, which catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the covered area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: Their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of the total marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three-quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear over this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to get worse.
Deep-sea habitats: very little is known about the deepest areas of the ocean, but the decline in the quantity of fish caught in these inaccessible locations in the last 40 years suggests that they are affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography working “My Story and (“My story, serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that he is not really interested in football and that he is the colleague he liked the least in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Grupo Futurs Medias, with quoted translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that President Gerrard never liked black people and
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who has made himself public and before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized his former colleague's attitude and professionalism.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on and he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn’t care about Liverpool at all and continued.
For example, the way he spit a huge and dense plague into a Celtic fan in a game by the Parkhead Uefa Cup in March 2003 is proof of his contemptuous and spiteful behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time on Anfield, his most notorious night at Celtic Park.
The Senegalese party was interrogated by the police after the episode of the spit and fined against his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as being lazy and selfish.
“His attitude was completely wrong and then he wrote Gerrard.
I felt I wasn't exactly ready to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who is now playing at the Malaysian club Sabah, criticized Gerrard publicly and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf named Gerrard the \"egoist\" and claimed that no one on Anfield likes the player who led the team to the victory of the League of Champions in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is jealous and
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of chief, and he lived there.
I am respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have placed me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is driven away whenever he leaves his hometown, Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos's quick road to “Dancing With the Stars”
In this season of Dancing With the Stars and Alek Skarlatos do not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, say to the producers.
“Buffing many categories and always looking for the most popular of the moment and said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear I'll find your manager after that.
It's charming.
She's got something special.
Before being a competitor to the famous show - but only a few weeks earlier - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after he took a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, set up a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
Then, 22-year-old Skarlatos, sentnnel to the National Army, which grew near Sacramento, received a call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although he can anticipate some local appreciation - Friday, at Sacramento, there was a parade in the youth's honor - he didn't expect so many positive reactions or invitations to attend the “Dancing With the Stars”
\"Even in a million years I wouldn't have thought I'd get this offer and confessed to Skarlatos on Saturday, in a break from dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything looks new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show on Monday night he admitted that he was also nervous and managed as a professional to his first foxtrot, getting scores that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said they offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at the DWTS and Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for guests on the last hundred meters, such as the Scarlatos case, which grew in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends who were on vacation, who took a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched the social networks, found the family members, and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When it appeared at \"Good Morning America\" and to tell about the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC's solar program to avoid going through all the media barriers.
He supported the five-minute plenary and then looked forward to finding out if Skarlatos would agree to take part in the DWTS and
\"A while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing and confessing Katz.
I've been fighting in Afghanistan a long time, and now I'm asking him if he's in the mood for dancing.
Skarlatos, who is on a short leave from the National Guard, didn't even see a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with his arm and his feet amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fan's favorite contestant and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That must have been the critical point, along with Katz's unceasing and unrelenting mess and the insistent messages she said.
“Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be dressed up and how the image of my friends will be protected and Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great sport lover and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up the rather rigid military position.
But Katz says he's confident he'll adapt and the spectators will react positively.
He's gonna get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
“How to not stand up and say Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To move on, he has to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says he's had fun in this completely unknown environment so far.
The program represented the toughest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments when it was acclaimed on the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
\"That took about a day and a half and he said.
In total, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in catching a person who attracts media attention, but it is not customary to be in the spotlight, Executive Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor manages and gets fun.
\"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a nice experience and Wade said.
\"I don't want Alek ever to say, \"Aoleu, in what I've gotten in front of you
Let's keep his fists for fun.
McRib from McDonald's returns.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's franchises offer this specialty of season.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
“At McRib’s 2015 promotion, approximately 8,000 restaurants participated and told McDonald's spokesman, Lisa McComb, for The Times in an e-mail.
In the USA there are over 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
But according to McComb, the individual owners of the French decide whether they will serve McRib or not.
\"The partnership is not significantly different from last year and says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider they want their local customers.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's restaurants that participate.
There is also a website with McRib (neaffiliate to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search for the nearest place to use this sandwich.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight with BBQ chicken pizza appetite.
Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones records would be prepared
Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones band may join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - had recently met in London and made clear recording plans as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after “A Bigger Bang and 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and sang in several small concerts in L.A., among which you represent at the Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the last of these, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, \"Sticky Fingers and
In particular Richards was busy this year, working with the documentary \"Keith Richards: Under the Influence and scheduled to be released on September 18th on Netflix.
This year, he released the solo album \"Crosseyed Heart and his third solo in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: “As always, Richards’ rough voice is a rather kind than distinguished instrument.”
But Richards was thrilled in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of the coming year.
He did not give any further details, but, judging by the latest concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman About Childhood, Maturity and The Family Fang
Jason Bateman has already been through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Some child actor on television shows as well as \"Silver Spoons as an adult has reaffirmed himself as a typical inexppressive in the television series \"Crying situation and in films as well as nightmare bosses\"
The first film that he worked as director was the very acidic comedy \"Bad Words and where you played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with The Family Fang and the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abair, winner of Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of brothers with problems.
The film has as its subject a festival looking for the American distribution.
Many book reviews considered it a comedy with strong emotional tent; the film reinterprets the story, putting the emphasis more on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
\"I've never seen the book and confessed to it.
In the book, the subject and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of Monday evening benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially for the \"The Hogan Family\" site and the late '80s and early '90s, to which Bateman worked. \"I met too many fans and Hogan Family and said Bateman sec when he went up on stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Guild Directors at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has in the center a family named Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way in which their children, Annie and Baxter, are used in their performances, for example by driving a bank robbery with acadeles or by playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is rather known for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines who is trying to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what about the story of the children's actors who want to evolve into adult life has been reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
\"My team was a very atypical and affidavit and Bateman.
I started acting when I was 10, with parents as managers, and this movie has a lot of elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun story.
“There’s a story I feel connected to that I understand deep and he added and, although I didn’t try to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood and
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write himself the adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own piece, and the Trenching to reality and in which he played Kidman.
Bateman testified that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in production and Photograph 51 and did not take the lead on Monday.
The book actor was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film an intelligent and caustic adaptation and what he has with typhoons of the much-exploited nature of the dysfunctional family, and sometimes the mission of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet-loving, incisive and usually very dark and
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film a very rough portrait and mentioned that Bateman has shown and made progress as a film director with this intelligent, structured adaptation, but never too clever or mechanical and
After the show on Monday, when Bateman and Walken went up the stage for the question session, the public had a long run on the many Walkers.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that \"I was impressed every day.\"
I couldn't believe the ease with which the film's director's work, which is very difficult, and that of the actor in the stage.
His focus is indeed amazing.
In a certain stage of dialogue, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the basement, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and is clearer.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor discussing with Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
“I find it incredibly interesting to watch movies and said Bateman.
All my decisions come from this, I never make them to benefit me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
Not to mention that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also Carter Burwell's composer for the sound column.
Known mainly for long-standing friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animated film \"Anomalisa - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and \"Legendity Gangsters and Brian Helgeland's interpretation of English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for Todd Haynes' Carol and film.
“Things with tones elongated or obtained me seem very interesting and says Bateman, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Browse through those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one tone to the next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With The Family Fang and Bateman made another bold step, both as director and actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mixture of drama, light and dark comedy.
As Bateman confessed when he finished introducing the film to the world premiere of months, “Good, bad, came out just as I wanted you to.
The festival sees as at the Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation of pedophile priests

Forensic detectives search the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the missing man Daniel Hind was last seen
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it was frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
\"We hope they'll search the house, I wasn't informed that they'll do it and she said.
Ms. Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to talk and tell the truth to the police.
\"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night and she said.
We're four kids and we also have other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Either way, we want him home and end the stories.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of motorways
By 2022, the Bulgarian government planned to build 635 kilometers of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometers of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of the pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities of the development plan of the road infrastructure approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable waste infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure an enhanced growth in fish and efficient management of fish transport, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the theft of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was restored to suit the new context, placing the emphasis on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for the “Organized Crime Fighting and (GDBOP)” focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sales of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which the recent studies placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the traffic of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's interior minister has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has become widespread, being described as a very serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously threatened and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc stated that it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be modified if it does not receive enough funding from the US government.
Vice President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give a statement that Aerojet offered 2 billion USD to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal shares for rocket launches by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
The analysts say that the amount bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to beat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for his new Vulcan missile.
ULA says Blue Origin's engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
The work on the new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian engines and RD-180 for military or spy US satellites, after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both in the Atlas 5 ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan rocket that ULA develops and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a whole new engine and rocket, as ULA is currently thinking.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet was planning to start testing the engines on a wide scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive sufficient funding from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
It further states that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a financing of approximately $160 million between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was considering trying other private engine financing options, but did not provide details.
The competition at the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for funding from the government.
The company producing AB InBev beer intends a 275 billion USD merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest beer-producing company in the world, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a take that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' dominance in Latin America with the SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their beer factories in Asia.
“The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America and said analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies try to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company on the site of two worlds and the manufacturer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed by AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must take place at the latest by 14 October, according to the British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing costs on marketing account, previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the manufacturer of ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB noted that it is too early to say what he will do, as they have not received any offers.
\"At this point, we are in the waiting phase and we decide and said the source.
Speculations about a merger, which would very likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for several years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisition by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August onwards.
\"It's exactly the moment you were expecting and you've got Phil Gorham's analyst from Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in the same years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, maybe even 45 pounds, according to the analyses, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would include SABMiller's debt.
That would make it the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of the amount of the transaction, and one of the biggest purchases in 1980 here.
SAB shares have been close to 19.9% at 36.14 pounds, giving it a US$90 billion stock market.
AB InBev has reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could look for another merger as a defense strategy, as happened the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle of soft drinks with Coca-Cola (KO.N) and in recent weeks there has been the suspicion of a combination with Diageo or with the Australian food firm Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
Overall market share of AB InBev, producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends a ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times, from the present 2.5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the nearest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have to borrow to finance an acquisition.
When he bought the company producing Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion USD, the biggest cash purchase in the history at that time. let the report grow more than 5 times.
A rising as big would allow him to amass a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev owns more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the producer of Altisa cigarettes (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altrea refused to give a statement that they were approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he regularly assesses investments in SABMiller and that this time we believe that keeping the assets is in the interest of our shareholders
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for the statement.
Neil Dwane, head of European, fair investment, at Allianz Global Investors, who has actions in both companies, says that AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
The ABI also pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches some 15%.
But we believe that the profit gained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years and Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant difficulties in breaching competition rules, particularly in the United States, where companies hold approximately 70% of the beer market.
“Economy that could be done at distribution operations is great, and the weaknesses related to the violation of competition rules are even greater and said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross School of Business at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company's share held by SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new CEO of the company.
Molson, headquartered in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last offers for the rest of 50 percent.
A Molson spokesperson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in a bid, but Molson's actions increased by more than 12 percent to the highest of their value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where the market leader is the partnership with SABMiller's CR Snow and China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could hold a percentage of 28% of the global market after transfers.

Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have given funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda later, police officers told Reuters Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in southern Karachi city.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in an attack in May on a bus with members of the Muslim minority in Islam, following which 45 people died, said to journalists and senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for Terrorist Combating the Province.
He will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
“Ahmed also funded the Afghan Taliban, still conducting research to see if he provided financial aid through his business or behind him was someone else and said to the officer.
“Ahmed also provided financial aid for AQIS and said, referring to Al Qaeda’s Al-Continent Indian organization, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, who are facing activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban prisoners massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to abuse activism.
There were severe attacks, while the army also stepped up in tribal regions outside the law on Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers of Pakistani cities that are under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, a 52-year-old, used to win sermons at a mosque in the good zone of the local authorities for the Karachi Army.
His public sermons were moderate, but, in particular, encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at Pakistani Air Force College in the city of Sargodha and left Pakistanian Air Force in 1998, declared another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
Later he entered the paint industry and chemical substances.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his application for copyright for \"Everyday I'm Hustlin\"
The New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words “Everyday I'm hustlin' and decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, “Everyday I'm shufflin' and
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, the prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, \"Hustlin' and is a temporary expression for which the courts have repeatedly mentioned that he cannot receive copyrights.
Williams' judicial decision weakens the process for the infringement of copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet in Los Angeles, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied “Hustlin’ and for their own famous songs in 2010, “Party Rock Anthem and that it contains the verse “Everyday I'm shufflin’” and
The hip hop star claimed that the LMFAO song is a clear attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin's song
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the song \"Party Rock Anthem\" and in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling shirts and other products with the shufflin slogan.
In the court ruling on Tuesday, Williams says that \"Hustlin' and as melodies, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross's three - word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyrights, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous versions of the music from the past, such as you got the right one, uh-huh and sholla back and you get it poppin' and saying that it's a short short expression, which all the courts declared unanimously as impossible to place under the rights of the authorities
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of his \"Hustlin' and
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the American District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching bomb leader Donald Trump in the republican preliminary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in seven-point surveys.
After Trump's 27% support in CBS/New York Times' latest survey, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, arrives at the second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, TV star Mike Huckabee, Florida senator Marco Rubio, each with 6 percent.
The support from the Republicans in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, in the numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who goes further to Bush's family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in one month, while the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker support is 2%.
Carson attracted more support than Trump in college graduates (29% and 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in preference and without a university degree (30% and 19%).
Trump is supported more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said that they are determined to support the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who have said that and who will vote support Trump twice as much as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects that of the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of democracy to the presidents, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest pursuit of CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders has risen by 10 points and by 22 points in Iowa, and in New Hampshire, respectively, among voters and democracy for preliminary purposes.
A renowned ethics specialist claims that sex robots should be banned
A renowned specialist in robotics industry has launched a campaign that calls for the prohibition of sexual robot development.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, an expert in robotics at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models they inspire - the way they will look, what roles they will have - are very disturbing and she told BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology and it has said it for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots now making themselves are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it in the face.
Certainly, the industry seems to take the lead.
A few years ago, the company producing inflatable True Companion dolls launched Roxxxy, the world's sexual robot and
However, concern about the possible high risks of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among large industry representatives.
Right this spring, the CEO of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC last December, cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that \"the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the development of the human race\"
United Kingdom meets the first refugees in Syria - UK RT
The following days, the United Kingdom will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced the Minister of Internal Affairs Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extended government resettlement programme.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps at the border with the war-torn country.
They are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said that the government works quickly and to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that they be given the assistance and support that they need and that they deserve.
I know that the members and the general public want to know more about the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
I and the Minister for Syrian Refugees, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the Chamber up-to-date in this regard.
But I am delighted to tell the House that we are waiting to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and we are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the weeks ahead.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew his anger from parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the government's refugee plan, and he felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom would raise its moral responsibility and receive 20,000 refugees from the Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics have noted that the figures mean only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal Democrat Paddy Ashdown said that the measures are the leaders and
Further, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they reach 18 years if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and personalities have also condemned the measures.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the crisis response is too late and
“It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to conflicts that drive people out of their homes and write them.
Rubla recovers on the background of global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian ruble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 and the US dollar and 73.98 euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percentages of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on August 24.
The analyses say that the return of the ruble has occurred due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by China's weights, the possibility and the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's quotations increased on Wednesday by 61 cents, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.
MORE CITIZENSHIP: Most likely, interest rate will rise in the US by the end of 2015 - US Fed
“It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and the moment the federal interest rate has increased, which will continue to give the tone for oil and rubella prices and told Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobbank, an expert in emerging market monetary policy strategies, established in London.
The experts also indicate another factor explaining the reinforcement of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
The global market is waiting with its soul at the mouth for the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday whether or not it will increase the interest rate.
The market considers that what could be the first and in nine years of the US interest rate will not happen and traded at higher rates on Wednesdays.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet to be established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a very intense concern about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco and mention research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, the chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, concern has increased on the merits of reports of events on the production limit of an accident and drone operation over football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
\"Over the past two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents and O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: the construction of a system that pursues all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 meters, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
“As more and more small drones fly at low altitudes, beyond the level of visibility of the pilot, or even fully autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, with the aim of ensuring the safety of complex operations, e.g. delivery of parcels in charge and she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods of avoiding unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and redirection through methods similar to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalling and gangs.
They expect to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is about to explode in the European Union in the years to come.
“We already see small and innovative SME companies in the United Kingdom using this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries,” says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dyslike Button: Why Facebook Wants to Know What Hurts You
\"Look Back and it works similar, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now less than the population of any country?
First, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - approximately USD 240 billion after the last statistics - is due to the amount of unimaginable data about the consumers it owns.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make is assembled and build a remarkable image of complexity, which is in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable first for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook, by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for other types of advertising agents that use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who appreciate a national football team, charities and promoters want to address those who, for example, support the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredible algorithms of intelligence and sophistication to restrict that huge universe of content you could see, in the smaller stream you actually see.
This algorithm depends in essence on what you considered interesting in the past and, especially, what you liked.
No doubt, there's a lot of interesting posts on Facebook, but unfortunate posts don't go into algorithm, because people don't feel they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might take the decision to eliminate this kind of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environmental representatives call this ‘emotional pollution and, although it sounds sinister, it’s probably just a simple Facebook test (and published, with their agreement) to better understand the way their platform works and if I can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What will happen to the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The real escape is the way in which the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason for this can be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work hides - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our lives in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that carries on a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it takes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones considered most appropriate to remain on the surface of this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that the body's signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
Kids with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say it hurts his head or that chess is too much noise and or I don't like this teacher.
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is sending us. And it is necessary to do this in a gentle and intrusive way.
For example, simply viewing the colors in an application can show the level of agitation. The wheel can be used to warn about a change of behaviour, and the blue for lack of interest, giving the nurse a sense that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The bracelet data can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with manufacturers to further develop this technology to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at the Wirral Authentic Society, who will present technology at the 2015 Autech conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular differences that can bring in as their life assistance technology. Now, iPad applications give, in turn, a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robo and help the kids learn to play and hide.
“Who knows where this innovation could lead us and tell her.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as charitable organisations for autism, to ensure that all of us have access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria and in the following weeks and
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air strikes on Isis targets in Syria, announced the government on Wednesday, just a few days after François Hollande declared that the intervention was a \"necessary\" and
France will carry out the first air strikes on the jihadist group of the Islamic State in Syria in the following weeks and told Jean-Yves Le Drian defense minister Wednesday.
The French air force is conducting reconnaissance missions to Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will continue in the following weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets and Le Drian said for the France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said in parliament Tuesday that the Islamic State has made very significant progress in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
“In the city of the Great there is an extremely powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian national coalition or what remains of it and he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition, which has bombed Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Holland has changed the strategy last week to extend the actions in Syria, under conditions under political pressure accumulates on the bottom of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militia in Syria.
The feature blocking ads from iOS 9 will make the phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrisome for online publishers - is the ability to easily block and announce during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the mobile version of the Safari browser from Apple.
On tests, it has been found that, after blocking advertisements, news sites such as New York Times are charged twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Ad lock also helps users maintain their use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising blocker, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch in the future an extension for Safari.
People using ad lock software experience a few constraints.
Claims are still displayed in the application (from here win Apple money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such information blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered free to consumers and has been financially supported for many years through advertising.
One report says that blocking ads could cost publishers online nearly 22 billion in advertising revenue only this year.
In order to activate blocking ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the immigration crisis with the King of Spain
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed several issues, but which probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the King have addressed the subject of the struggle against the Islamic State and the ever-increasing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which already faces hundreds of thousands of people who have left their home country to go west.
\"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in the very dangerous journeys, and the problem of human trafficking and said Obama.
Of course, the problem has gotten worse in the past few months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of which Spanish territory Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
\"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we firmly committed to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain and Obama said.
The Supreme Commander has already told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before his term of office ended in 2017.
“We welcome you with open arms and Philip answered.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made her Queen a White House tour and had a tea talk.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States since the accession to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.

Arctic land kings are big enough to take down a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proved to be a good thing for others.
One of these advantageous species is the Arctic lander.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the country here to appear earlier and increase, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to exemplify the effects of temperature changes on Arctic soils.
Their analysis anticipates an increase of 50% in the survival rate of adult countries under a 2 degree increase in temperature Celsius.
The landowners are small, but they are important members of the Arctic Trofi chain and of the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing population could affect the karibus they feed on, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollute.
To build their demonstrations, scientists at Dartmouth combined their results from the field with the results of laboratory experiments that investigated how temperature influences the development of insects and the readiness to be predator hunts.
Although increasing the temperature makes larger farmers more vulnerable in front of the coleopters, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
Fewer countries mean a larger population, which can be developed but only to the extent that they can support insect food sources.
The ability of citizens to turn their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies point out that administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neural or behavioral development.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin (SSRI) inhibitors present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, and therefore should be treated.
“These studies add an ever-increasing set of evidence on the safety of antidepressant administration during pregnancy and stated in a press release by John Thorp, Deputy Editor-in-Office of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, thus far evidence appears to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those of antidepressant administration.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51,404 children in the Norwegian cohort study of mother and child, investigating the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of motor skills at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them had been treated with long-term medicines.
Although exposure to SSRI has been associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers have written in the study that the association has not been so significant as to grant delay a clinical importance and
A group of researchers at Adelaide University in Australia conducted a data examination for 49,000 women in the Danish National College of Nations to discover the effects of SSRI on children's behavior up to 7 years of age.
The study found that net depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioral problems.
In 210 children whose mothers had been treated against depression with SSRI there was no increased risk of behavioural problems, compared with 231 children who were more prone to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and social issues.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to post-natal bleeding if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from the medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information collected by researchers on specific health conditions for women - which could have had an effect on the bleeding potential.
“It is possible that women who took antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were the ones with the worst stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants and says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Only on the basis of this study do we recommend that women stop treating medication against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of possible bleeding.
Matthew is being charged for murder in case of murder of the student at Virginia Technical University
The man accused of killing student Hannah Graham at Virginia University was charged for qualified murder in the case of a student at Virginia Technical University who was missing in 2009, announced on Tuesday the authorities.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, put Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officers say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Every head of charge receives the maximum prison sentence on life.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution has brought them relief.
“For six years, we have been working hard and determined to do this, ” says Gil Harrington, Morgan’s mother.
I'm delighted to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your act.
For Jesse Matthew, the domino pieces of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for this and waits for the sentence in this case.
He's staying in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of a qualified murder in case of the death of a student from the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17th, 2009, along with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with the Pantera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The families and friends started an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of teaching studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a Charlottesville apartment unit.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, on a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
During Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear whether that period overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant breakthrough in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officers who knew the investigation said these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not momentarily make public the details of the new evidence that led them to put Matthew under charge for Harrington's murder.
Defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, representing Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after the completion of a year after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they came out in the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a downtown mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a nationwide search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the rallies and sights organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that must be silenced by the new heads of prosecution against Matthew.
“During this time there have also been discussions about the kind of why she wears a short skirt and knows how to look for it with candles, but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the tracks of the hunt and added Harrington.
In the Fairfax County case, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who at the time of the attack was 26 years old, swore to them that, on a September night, while she was coming home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green area, beat her up and held her neck, then attacked her sexually.
\"I thought my city came, I had to scream slowly and confess to the woman.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A prosecutor has sworn to them that Matthew may have been scared by the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will be sentenced in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time on the Harrington case in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Morgan's father, Dan Harrington, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
\"Cel so, today I've taken a step and says Dan Harrington.

The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the statement that Hungary could raise a metal fence at our country's border.
MAE appears to have been briefed in relation to this decision and that this is not a fair political gesture.

In turn, or in due course, the EMA informed the relevant decision makers in Romania in due course of time, as a matter of urgency, in connection with this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and who are strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture, in line with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian Party, is still shown in the communication.

“The yard would start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moved to Romania and explained Szijjarto.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants who were transiting Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to catch the fence built by the Hungarian authorities at its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can bypass the fence through the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government allocated 22.2 billion forks (€71.8 million) to build a controversial metal fence at the Serbia border, a distance of 175 kilometers, and for the special centres needed for immigrants.
The initiative of the fence is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.

This, like other mayors in the Hungarian border area, said that the police asked for information about the accommodation available in the face of a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can stay.
We don't have spaces for refugees in the commune.
We believe that such special centres should not even appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, migrants being tempted to escape, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centres in more remote areas of the border and said the mayor of Iratusu, Papp Atila Iosif.

‘Dorel and mounted the traffic light in reverse
At Suceava, the workers set up a traffic lights upside down, so instead of being instincted that they have to wait 4 seconds, passersby get the \"h\" message and that I don't know how to decipher it.
Don't worry, anyway everyone goes to the red, informs the truth.
Everyone passes by the way he cuts his head.
Two boys were supposed to be taken up by a car because they passed by red.
“Politists from the Rutiera should be here, to help, until the world gets used to and said a woman for the source quoted.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in the center of Suceve, but passersby do not seem willing to take account of it, with as much as the information received seems to be unintelligent.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If you said you were doing your job the right way and someone was found to be responsible enough to make it okay to finish the work, then you would not have gotten into this absurd situation.

Tsipras, about the Greek drama - why it agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The stated aim of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with EU leadership from Brussels.
Finally, the leader Syriza made part of a third loan agreement in Greece for this country, which involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which carries out an interview with him.
Now, though, Tsipras asks the Greeks to entrust the prime minister again to him in elections that he claims will increase his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
“Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece remains open and the former Prime Minister has also declared.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
“But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement and Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered until 2019.
‘Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece definitely needs reforms and specifies that it must begin with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, opening the way for early elections in September after seven stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, the period during which a third bailiff loan was approved for Greece.

They're taken in front of the West machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian press, where he speaks of refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorism and as he saw immigrants.
\"The scientist complains for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said that this is a peaceful revolt and said Assad, in an interview granted Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say the situation in Syria is such terrorism as the Islamic State, so because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian President
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hug them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, it won't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we think about the crisis.
“This is the core of the entire refugee issue and added the Syrian leader.
Assad continued to accuse the Western states of the treatment they show to refugees.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with an eye and taking them in vision with the second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees have actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorism and crime and second-hand because of the results of terrorism.
“When you have terrorism and the destruction of the infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win your exist somewhere in this world and say Bashar al Assad.
\"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and safety for every person and every family' and stressed Syrian president, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, should unite around what the Syrian people want
The president of Syria is of the opinion that his country's dialogue should continue and reach consensus that it cannot be implemented unless we violate terrorism in Syria and
“I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we, like Syrians, can achieve the political objectives we want through dialogue and political action and has also declared Bashar al Assad.
He talked about one of his country allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from his friend in the West, into his enemy.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, once again accusing the West for falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western media after the blow in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a country.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition in Russia and has come to power through undemocratic means, despite the fact that it was chosen in democratic elections, and the West itself has acknowledged that elections have been democratic.
Now, they're not democratic anymore.
\"This is Western propaganda and scored the leader of Damascus.
Not in the last place, it included Russia on the list of country friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, as it faces the same type of terrorism and
In contrast, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said he could not even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries.
In addition, the president of Syria accused the international coalition of the United States, who fought against terrorism: “In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand
In other words, the coalition failed and had no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Western countries that ensure a cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
\"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will bite you - then we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, given that it is a real and not false coalition, which has fought against terrorism and has also declared the leader of Damascus.
Autumn?
No, it's not.

Map of countries with the highest cost of living in Romania
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of the workers in the extract of the title, the shareholders of the energy companies and the countries that depend very much on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has cost enormously.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in the period October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of fuel has dropped.
The most important price reduction in the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.
The opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refinement, changes in taxation, but also fluctuations in the currency rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from every state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (about 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
So we're ranking 27 in the country's turn with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The face of the last quarter of 2014, gas was cheap in the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
However, the countries around are doing better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans set in motion the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised, Tuesday night, that the federal government will give extra support to the 16 lands of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a nearly 4-hour meeting with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large number of refugees and notice the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centres.
“These pivot points are needed and she stressed.
The entire country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The First Lands asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at federal level more than a week ago.
Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for a little double amount, and for commitments, to be accelerated and in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into the German society.
“We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also the business, unions and civil society and she said.
Dreyer also called for the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed processing in 48 hours and Holland in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Land Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria bears the worst burden, with the most migrants arriving after they crossed the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, came into public conflict with Merkel after the cancellation announced a virtual open-door policy at the beginning of the month, remembers DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Romanian coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost out of office was disadvantaged.
Before the match I said one thing, that I wish to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with important teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
It's two totally different ways.
We were given a yellow card immediately, while the top teams weren't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A game also level should not have been influenced by arbitration.
\"I regret that the arbitration ruined the game and said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
\"Woman, what smells and smells here and
They were pieces of the cut-out husband
A crime of a common sadism terrified the people of Târgu Belimos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Târgu Beautiful were able to see terrifying scenes near the main entry into the market.
Along the three dumpsters, the killers assembled and what seemed to be a man's body.
It was broken, but it lacked its head, internal organs and genitals.
In the end, it had to prove that it was the body of an ex-officer, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
\"The IceZiaul and he spoke out on the eve even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing, to the path of the bags with the dead body.
His stories make his hair cute.
The one who warned the police yesterday about the fact that a woman carrying three bags that sucked awful, after pieces of the body had been found at the market, was a taxi driver from Târgu Beautiful.
As in American movies, the man himself helped transport the bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing, the criminal being his client for a race.
The taximetrics told, exclusively for the ‘Ziare de Iga and the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a murderer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the body parts of the husband's husband's geography teacher, which he had cut.
She came to Târgu Belimos to hide the evidence of the crime, as far away from her home, from Roman.
Maybe he has mine.
I didn't know.
Nea Mihai, as is known to her friends who practice taxis in Târgu Beautiful, has arrived star over the night in the small and in which you live.
He saw American films throughout his life, but he never thought he would ever get to be himself the one who would base the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he would see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
This story tells that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, he expected the arrival of buses that regularly transit the locality.
It lies close to the intersection of roads to the Romans and to the Pascans.
The taximeterist tells that the murdered woman observed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the body parts bags supported by the indicator showing the locations close.
She came in the night with the Massaro race, from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters from the pedestrian crossing from the Pascani, exactly to the terminal where it shows the mileage.
The bags were rezemated by the sign sign.
After the bus left, I gave it to the marcher ten meters up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put in a bag, I asked: “Woman, but what smells and smells like here.
I saw that she's an old woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought it took meat to the market, at the disposal, maybe it had mine, I didn't have a way to know.
I've been thinking that maybe he wanted to scream at someone with that ugly meat smelling.
She was trying to pick up a bag by herself, and I started to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
\"He specified me to take her to the big market gate, when I took her from the bus and started telling Mihai about it.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman didn't say anything at all, and so he wasn't curious to ask her any more.
Until the destination, I didn't speak anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in my car.
And when he took his bags off the car, I noticed that he smells worse and worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I walked back into the car, I went two meters back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over here, to disappear the smell.
At the bus, I didn't notice if someone helped get down the bags because I had lights in the back and I didn't see well in the mirrors.
\"There were two bags of plastic and one of raids and completed the man.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says he started to grind his curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something's not right.
After he took his bags down, I went to the hospital, to the City Hall, and when I came back, I looked specifically at what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She had been carrying the luggage behind the fence in the meantime, where there are also the dumps inside the market.
Then I left again.
She was kept nervous because they arrived a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but the drivers probably didn't want to take it because they had international races, and I don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she was walking over here.
At some point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an outside employee what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I saw her a while ago.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them she was a suspect.
\"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belceşti and completed Mihai.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after leaving the luggage in the dumpsters.
To me, the suspicion left from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing up there and showed it to me, telling her I warned her she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
\"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around three o'clock, when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors from the spot and ended his taxi driver report.
Prosecutors of Neam and, investigating the case, say that 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the sight cameras of a gas station in Roman at 0.55, going up with the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at the Beautiful Târgu at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed the wife, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then pulled him into the house.
The man was Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was an officer in reserve.
Sunday night, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus, and hid them.
The other night, he transported one more, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Here.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a drawer from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors did not find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychologically expert, and the body will be examined by law doctors, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The city took over the national roads on the municipal level, after years had been taken over by the government, in order to be asphalted with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and to be implemented requires a decision by the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a counter because it was in place and to give the opinion for the General Banistic Ur Plan (PUG).
The city took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take over the national roads transiting the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Routes unless the law is respected, and it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have been in our administration since today.
“Of course, the government decision will have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council and the interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national routes that call the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Route 28 stra beats the city on the arteries: the Păcurari road, the Păcurari road (to the maforum), the Moara de Fire, the Silvestru road, the Silvestru street, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. the spring, the Chisinau road, the easy road until the exit from the municipality to Tome and - Albizi.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium road, bd. Socola (up to semaphor), Bucium street (up to base 3), Chisinau road, cd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Carlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some files from Mircea Eliade's file and political sympathies of youth, which, however condensed, should be presented in excess of the size of a daily article, should be broadcast in the series, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most recent heads of accusation used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called anti-Legionary and would suit to spark in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing the criticisms of the various versions of Eliade's registration in the Legion through the Cuib “Axa” and Radu Gyr, Florin hurcanu brought into discussion in the volume of Mircea Eliade.
Prisoner of History (Bucureti, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us at the highest level in understanding the resumption of epistolar contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after he played Ceauşescuescăa balcona and since August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the Safety investigation in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as a follow-up note from 1938, Florin hurcanu states that “Eliade will not enter their group, but also in the same legional family called Light, a group of excuiburi and intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr and
As there are no verifiable data on the Luminition nest, those in exile considering the existence of this legionate and debatable family, what needs to be discussed is, by the end of the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising kindness of the SRI to make these secret files available to Mr. Urcanu, it is more than clear that, at that time, the goal of the Security Seeker was \"the Commander and Radu Gyr, the mention of Eliade being made, according to the memo of March 21, 1938, in the context in which Armand Calinescu, the Interior Minister received free hand to take all necessary steps so that King Carol could impose his Royal Decree, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the principal political force of legionaries who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (Part II for the third country in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by the branch: “Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr —
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a slight bureaucratic cover for the 1938 repression and it is likely that such superficial notes would have been made to the repossess for the vast majority of legionators or active sympathizers in the public space to be arrested, but which were to be linked by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement above, given in the arrest, in February 1941, after the collapse of the legionary rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the ordinary method of bureaucratic cover in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would have been interesting if you had offered more details about the content of the above-mentioned 573 folder.
Was it Eliade's or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it must be a file built on the safety documents anyway, but then processed by Security to be used either against one or the other.
Here is a misunderstanding, just as in the use of the term “membrane” of the Movement, which only someone who knows the formation of the internal structures of this radical organisation based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a premerging stage, of proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, who has been in the trial period for three years before becoming a chambermaid and with acts in all.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or cenacles, seats, discussion groups with peasants, youth organisations or students gravitating around a nest, were his \"family, were not his own nest said, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuance completely escapes the unavoured reader by making Eliade's reputation (which may be plausible) understood and used ad literam to designate political regiment in the nest.
Of course, invoking subtleties of interpretation of this kind cannot hide the public activity of supporting the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade during the period 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu's seat or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe does not, however, necessarily mean, and the political regiment of your own that is all the more than, usually, intellectuals of this class retain a kind of superiority in the face of such activities and does not enter into politics until they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could form an opinion on Eliade's kind of thinking at that time, when he was the leader of the young generation and I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigours of a legional nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention, except in passing, the fact that, in any case and legionary, what it receives is the anti-Semitic public activity as well as the violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Eliade, until new evidence.
Regarding Eliade-Gyr's correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic advocate of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin hurcanu's claims (but nevertheless based on some archival documents, even if it had deserved more serious dissensions and contextualized) with an argument yet questionable.
Mircea Hangoca notes, in the volume Noi glosses over Mircea Eliade (Bucureţa, 2006), that one row of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any hint at this frame.
Nor was it like in 1968, when Radu Gyr, who came out of communist quarters, could have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think Mircea Handoca wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Eliade's ancestry.
There really is no palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Eliade's chief.
Intelligent, the poet forced to write in the Glaul Patria, reveals from the head of the place the embarrassing condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very precisely what mission had that publication which was constantly dealing with the denigration of the right exile), in the signature, after your old friend and what to expect and is clearly relieved and happy when he responds to his affection after nearly three decades of separation since the viclean time and alienated him.
There is no doubt that, beyond the resignation with which he had been commissioned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could be quiet at least to see his mother and friends) and that, skilled, he meets the section by short sentences, separated from the paragraphs, to suggest their foreign body character, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
There is no mention of esoteric allusions, refined political complicitys suggested or any evocation of young years and in other than cultural registers.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin hurcanu, we have in this match memoirs that confess a mutual price of characters who have marked different, but stately, our culture and who, beyond the severe trials of life, find the tone of civilization and inter-war education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, pillaging for the strength of friendship and respect for each other beyond the destiny referred to by the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally resigned to the refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and catastrophic floods in the country, announces the authorities of the RSR, through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he cannot give the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it is re-set to index, it mounts in Israel the Toladot business and the books sent to family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard 1973) are stopped by censorship, never see its mother again.
Among the friends in the country only Noica has a sporadic correspondence of information, surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions and are more able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceauşescu regime attempted Eliade's second convincing operation (by official invitations, Noica's proceedings, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign player
Because of the Aboriginal volleyball shortage, Penicillina Ia and testing in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The meetings take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril's command
Retrograded in the first half of the year of Division A1 of the female volleyball, Penicillina Ia and kept its place in the first stage due to the withdrawal and then the completion of the Miroslava Science band, freshly promoted in the first stage following a barage tournament played even in the outgoing commune.
The news also took on the unprepared leadership of the outgoing group, who stayed awake without the principal coach (after the departure of Rare and Puni, arrived second to the Bacau Science) and many missing players, some withdrawals such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Stundenu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdilă (at the champion of the Alba Blaj Vola) and Maria and Iuliana Fica sisters.
Of course, until the start of the championship scheduled for October 10th, there was also time to complete the lot.
First, a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neam and who has worked more in Penicillina in recent years, he is keen to sign a contract with the group led by the Basque Vasile.
Then were brought two players from the science of Miroslava, Raluca Picchiu and Tatiana Diaconi, being tried a few foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to the transfer being the poor player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrenca Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril performed a cantonation at the Gura Humor, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the seats achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from September 23-25, Penicillina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make a valuable team.
We have a skilled coach with experience, but the player fund in Romania is quite small, and that is why we will call on Volebalists from abroad, especially after the decision was made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
“We hope to arrive at the end of the competitive year in 5-6 places , even if it will be very difficult and mentioned, the Left Vasile, the President of the ACS Penicillina Iaşi.
Emotional meeting.
Twins meet after almost 70 years
Gemini George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their mother of Polish origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated and not only from the one who gave them life, but also from each other.
Tens of years George and Lucian didn't know about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents showing that it was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they found no trace to lead them to Lucian.
Just in 2015 , thanks to the program ,Restoring Family Links and the Red Cross, the twins met again and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home four medals from Stuttgart to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children from the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sport Dance Federation.
Five couples who trained at the Dance Energy Club participated from ICA and danced with 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 children in the country participated in five different categories (youth 1, youth 2, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were paired: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy prominent places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cujbba and not lastly the couple of Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioni.
As a coach I wanted to reaffirm the results achieved in March this year, this reconfirmation is necessary both for us as teachers and for sportsmen as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals, gives us enormous hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to an even higher level.
“All of these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work and told Andreea Ramona Manolache, the children’s coach at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented in this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4 of the 20 participating countries.
It should be noted that from the nine medals, four came to the city.
6 ways to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us let us run a weekend up the mountain to get rid of the stress.
Some keep our time, others - finances, and others both obstacles.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
These do not involve any high costs or specially allocated time, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we make them face and what attitude we take to them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling how an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the next relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep Breathe
Breathing exercises are not intended solely for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any man in part, and the regulation of breathing at a tense moment helps release endorphins into the body, process leading to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know that we have exceeded the age of childhood and we no longer allow ourselves to be ready when we feel like it.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and don't like how much we keep our spread.
You can escape the nerves of negative energy accumulated over the course of a day with a few scratches.
Imagine a nice place for you.
We know that the recommendation sounds worthy of a replication during a psychotherapy session, but it's not often used by psychologists.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires calmness and detachment from the daily frenzy, can lead to attenuation of the nervousness.
It's really about self-suggestion, the process that can even change lives, both in good, as well as in bad.
Everything depends on what we're self-sufficient.
The best thing is to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put the castles in your ears and listen to the relaxation music.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might encounter weights in relaxing.
Listen even to the relaxation melodies, which are smooth and do not contain verses, to rebalance the timing when the fitilum has been lit.
Decorate or orange
Does it sound strange to advise you to peel an orange to the nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not about fruit itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to completely disconnect us (ocational, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during the decoying, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, hormone of well-being.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals close by, whether it's about the one at home, or it's about the one who's been hoisting over the place of work, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mangae may decrease blood pressure.
with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writing hotnews.ro.
Florentin: “We found each other, and from that moment we made a great pleasure to sing together, with a practically unlimited repertoire and
We thought this was the time for a violin with a guitar.
Christ: “From the first meeting we realized that it is very good to hear what we sang and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work and
Each of us has learned from the other's repertoire, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florintin: “I know there is a gap between classical music people and the rest of the city.
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a genre of music that could make those who listen only to classical music to listen and rock, and those who listen only to rock to get to like them and classical music.
And we had the surprise to tell us at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to something like that and they would like it.
Christ: “When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems wonderful to us
Students in Iaşi stayed more in traffic than in school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of exits were yesterday morning and captivating in hell traffic in several areas.
The city announced that today the Mangeron boulevard (splai Bahului mal left) between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roşi is closed.
The Presidents of the City Council have not respected their promises to carry out work to fluidize traffic with the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given, at least twice over the past few weeks, has found in the re-establishment of the tour in the International Railway Area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be set up, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, the tour was not carried out yesterday.
The drivers' nerves were stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that also another promise of the City Hall was violated: the change of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis and that late until the end of August and in the context in which this transfer is discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The turn will be done at the right time, we have to take into account the traffic of the trams in the area, we need an opinion from the National Routes.
\"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on tour, but we'll sort it out and Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to it, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of the Red Podu.
The car queue from St. Lazarus' Street was extended to the SRI headquarters.
“I waited for good minutes to get out in the Red Bridge and said an alien.
By Podu Roşi in September it was necessary to travel to the CUG, if the rehabilitation project — Southern functional artery development and rehabilitation — was completed within the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original.
“I have drawn European funds for new works, for example, overcrowding, on the initial version of Nicolina’s passage was narrow and commented on Chirica.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of tram traffic is October.
During yesterday's day, the Palestinians reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or intersections in Base 3.
The landlords might come back as chief to CJ.
In the course of tomorrow I'll be sure.
The judges of the Tribunal will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Jewish Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The Judges of the Court of First Instance resolved yesterday a new deadline in the dossier ‘Album and in which the accused is also suspended Presidents of the County Council of Iasi.
At the end of yesterday's meeting, the magistrate decided to speak in the course of tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Administratia.
The latter wishes to reside or revoke this measure, which has been holding it away from CJ's chief chair for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is mentioned by the superior court, Cristian Adôncias will be able to resume its safety function of the CJ.
The rulings were sued by the National Directorate of Anticoruptia (DNA), being accused of favoring the perpetrator and false intellectual after, I say, the corruption, they would have tried to mask an audit control by which a number of irregularities were discovered regarding receipts from a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The rulings would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more of the promotion materials of the Ia city county, although scriptically these materials appeared as being received by the CJ.
Along with him there have been differences of justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the manager of the company Laser Co.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote by 25 September
The municipality is prepared to distribute further questionnaires, if the 12,000 are to be exhausted.
The Greeks have only ten more days to express their opinion on the replanting of the teas on the pedestrian Ştefan the Great.
According to municipal officials, up to now about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the neighborhood centres and in three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Explanaada Alexandru the Good and the City Hall).
A record number of exits appeared on Sunday before the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group, the city loves the tei and 530 foreigners voted in 140 minutes, and nearly four votes expressed each minute.
Instead, throughout the day of months, there were about 440 exits in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that they also advertise the inefficient signaling and population of public consultation.
Therefore, they made a call yesterday to internet users to print a group information display and to stick it in the block stairs.
The volunteers also indicated that at the additional point in the Copou Park, the latest forms were completed by the exits on Sunday.
We'll offer forms from the neighborhood centers, where it's not too complete.
“Eventual additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed and spokesperson of the municipality, Sebastian Buraga, said yesterday.
\"Looking at the zero of the fabrics and ending on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of replanting the trees then the City will plant your silvers in this fall.
The Greeks can express their opinion at the district centres in Dacia, Belmoasa, Tatráraş, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The presidents of the city decided to cut the land off the Ştefan the Great at the beginning of 2013, an action that attracted a fine of 60,000 lei municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group and the city of Love of Teas and an online community comprising about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of the land was signed, until yesterday evening, by over 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iaş!

The University has 920 students in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine and Ion Ionescu from Brad and indicated that this year they were the least admitted candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, from the start.
We are very pleased with the results this year from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, nearly 920 students in the year I. We have never exceeded such a number.
“We also had higher average candidates, we occupied budget seats at the license and master’s degree and said Prof. John Şenu, a teacher responsible for teaching activity.
It further noted that the university has registered a considerable number of students at the tax rate, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly larger figure than in other years.

At the master's office, 18 files were presented in the autumn session, on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootehnie.
Drivers are afraid that the wheels of the cars will go into the cracks on the Tudor bridge Vladimirescu
The bridge over the Bahlui on the boulevard Tudor Vladimirescu remained as clumsy as when the “Ziaul de Iaşti” wrote about the problems it presents ten days ago.
Our daily reporters then signaled that on the axis that delimits the two senses of walking the asphalt was left, defending deep groups, some even 20 centimeters, through which the concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to crack on one side and on the other side of the axis, with signs that the depths would increase.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram station, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica specifies that the area affected by cracks and groups will be signalled, and asphalt recovery work will be carried out quickly.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the assembly of populists and signalling bands, without even making a simple lead.
In this period, we have focused more on opening the school and the necessary work for that purpose.
“There is a point-by-point expertise for the bridge that we are waiting for in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation and told the interim mayor.
Early school years
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stephen, started school.
The preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if to be happy or to let myself be overwhelmed by melancholy; I lean, passive, toward the second option.
First, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took it for the first time, emotionally, to kindergarten.
Although soft breath, no normal parent is glad to raise their children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, at the top, did not end until today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend it, even if as a teacher.
When I decided that this is what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like each one of us, I've given all kinds of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, smarter or fairer.
It happens, unfortunately, to exist people with other calls in this puzzle.
I think they're toxic, because they're giving up enthusiasm and even a young man's mind willing to form.
I was lucky to give, as much as I was a student or a student, over a few, you know, give them exceptions.
These meetings can be decisive if they are held at the right time.
Whoever thinks that the role of the chair is the trivial transmission of information is wrong.
This can be done by anyone; the student can be informed very well by himself, that we only live in the age of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the minds of the students.
They're forming them, they're calling them thinking.
Staying in the chair is not a privilege, as I believe quite well, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturo, demanding, unforgettable and always willing to look for the hybels in front of them.
I'd dictate their age, the temper.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had uncertainty about anything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of his category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he's about to doubt himself, ask his questions.
To discover on their own the answers, either they or the provisional ones.
To get involved in everything he does.
Let's direct him discreetly to profitable models.
It is very difficult, especially that most of the time the student believes that the teacher is his enemy.
One who just waited to catch him on the wrong foot to punish him.
Now, that's right for him, the unfathomable, rebellious, to live out his old calls, to look at him from the cathedral with suspicion.
That it just doesn't have the natural way to accept his attempt to order it.
Teenagers are not left out, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if I get the impression that they do, they'll get revenge somehow.
And, unfortunately, when a rigid person is in the chair, who imposes himself through hardness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object handed down.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a intelligence of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their unhealthy mind.
I always urge my students: if you give up a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became self-aware?
I had a very good teacher in classes VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the pube since then on his own.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I looked at him as a man in another world: he had walls of the house covered with embroidered shelves of books.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having one too.
Now maybe I have it, but if I didn't get it out of my way, maybe I'd decide to be a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in chance.
It's essential to get over the man who takes you by the hand and to be patient toward your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me only to discuss what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be taught.
There is no literature teacher, as there is a mathematics teacher.
How do you fix ineffective concepts?
You can at least approach him, without pretense that he conveys stoned truths.
The one in the cathedral can best guide reading, that's something else.
But above all, it can take on some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which I can raise, talk to someone, the sols on his eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must, first of all, succeed in making his students understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologu, states one thing only apparently paradoxical: “What literature, so much life, not inverse and was right.
That's why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in a field anyway open.
Luckily, we always have to learn something.
And we, teachers; or especially new, teachers.
Most of the time, it only repeats from the inertia and a great truth: not only do the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student an apprentice.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's greater happiness to a pure-blood teacher than to bear as many such separations.

If you extend the FIFA investigation
Justice from the United States and Switzerland will carry out new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will start in the case of new people and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, informs the international press.
American Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced on Monday at a press conference in Zürich that the area of investigations into global football corruption was wide.
“On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional criminal prosecutions to new individuals of new organisations and Lynch said.
In May, several FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the US.
“We hope that and other prosecutions will reach the US and add Lynch.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had sequestrated several assets, including residents and lands in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
\"I didn't even make it to the end of the first one, and Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terrabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
To the investigators’ attention, a media rights contract was also entered into at the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA is facing a major corruption scandal, after American justice accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice Presidents and seven forum officials.
The persons retained are researched to take bribes and receive other profits from the early 1990s and to date, totalling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swissman Joseph Blatter announced at the beginning of July that he was resigning from FIFA's security function after being re-elected for the fifth time.
He's fighting like in movies at the theater.

I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the final, so now I'm going to take revenge on him.
\"The beast turned him into cats and said Moroşnu.
In 2015, the brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have in Italy their last confrontations before fighting for world titles on November 7th in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.

The youngest student at Craiova Detention Center is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
We chose to participate in the opening of the school year at a center belonging to the National Penitentiaries Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to lesser known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in class I, and the youngest is 25 years old and is enrolled in class XI.
“There are complicated topics society is concerned with debating at the moment, we are all concerned with our own concerns and problems, but we do not have to look at the lessons that they are over 100 young people in Craiova’s Detention Center offer and said, Monday, Minister Robert Cazanciuc, at the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice pointed out that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material possibilities, could lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could have followed the natural school course of any child, if they had had the opportunity not only to learn to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what the consequences might be disrespectful.
\"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate the people who have violated the law, to shut them behind high walls, but to try to re-draw them and prepare them, because when they return to the community to have more chances of reintegration and added Kazanciuc.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment must be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to speak of the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, are over 2000 graduates of school education courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change over the night what hasn't been done for 25 years, but there are important steps we take.
“In all these steps we need and support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and is not a danger to society and has also said Kazanciuc.
The Minister of Justice has hated success for both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
And you know because today is the feast of the Highness of the Holy Cross, you would launch all the students and teachers invited to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Mărăti and not only, to understand what the fight of young people for ideals means and said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiars to be destroyed!
Petitions of prestigious university students from Ias and the country
Over 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society in Romania asking the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even decommission the doctoral schools in Romania and allow and promote academic taxation.
Among the petition signatories launched on 10 September are also teaching frameworks and teachers from Iaşi.
Among the signatory universities of the petition from the Greek academic environment is, for example, also Prof. Dr. Liviu Antonesis.
At the national level, petitions have names from former ministers of education, such as Mircea Michela, to culture people who are also university teachers, such as Andrei Plesu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pipidi.
\"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus causing the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that blatantly violate ethical rules in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance and are specified in the petitions initiated.
The petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiars have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility for grants of IDEI-type projects.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
“Why there are no other colleges in Europe that provide doctorates organized by secret services, and the leading military that give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment, and Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, President of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, originally from Iasi, said.
It can be supplemented by all the company's Internet page users, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organisations to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The party for Iaşi and founded by young managers of IT political non-affiliated, was launched elsewhere in Copou Park.
The chairman of the Initiative Group, Mr Iaşi, gave an interview to the President of the Iaş —
The city will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of last week the Forge Party and the organisation that will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
At present, the core of the party is made up of IT specialists, but the training leaders say that all people who want to get involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organisations.
The launch took place on Saturday in the Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers participated, almost all of them being young.
The special invitation of the action was Nicuşor Dan, President of the Salvation Association and Bucharest.
He was the surprise of the 2012 local elections when, in the independent position, he managed to collect 10% of the votes of the Chechens for the capital's primary function.
“The people I saw at the ‘Towards of Iasi and I think they are very good for accessing in the public administration of Ica and
I believe in this initiative, I think it has chances, I think it may have more chances in a smaller community than in Bucharest.
\"I'll be with you all the time for taking care of you and said Nicuşor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave the city to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I've been on a lot of short business trips, I've lived in Cluj for a year.
I've come back every time, because I felt like this is my home.
ZDI: Why did you decide now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have started to know each other for a while.
We met in professional settings, we started talking about how we could get involved.
At first, we have become more timid, in smaller things, with projects in NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have evolved natural and organic and now it has happened to be the time when we have reached the decision that we have to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make the local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of minimal information about the city's activities so that the different departments, institutions and regions cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about informational organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we talk about efficiency, we don't have to forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
We need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is extremely important.
How would I promote the city?
Andrei Postolache: You're on the plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can sell the city.
You have to want to do this and you know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What is the Goat brand?
Andrei Postolache: My view is that we have to be a president of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to extend it, go to medicine, get into the robotic area, into the 3D printing area, continue this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the intelligence area, I mean here at the modern city brand.
Of course, the city already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely cultural ones.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still held in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and running projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not party online.
We don't want to have volunteers and take the bus.
That means we're counting on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there's plenty of people like that.
ZDI: Should the mayor of the city be more concerned with promoting national and international imagery, or is there a need for the area of concern to be in a permanent form of an editorial nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First you have to solve today's problems, emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't attract money into town, at some point you stay out of money and you won't be able to make, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you need people with skills next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-tuck, who comes and knocks his fist at the table and solves everything.
Nope.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area to the party who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something right, to have an unsuspecting reputation, to be clearly integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000 who want to get involved and do something for themselves.
Interview by Alex Andrei
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was established, after seven years, as director of the International Endava (2008 - 2015), where it coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that was set up with another IT specialist provides consulting services in management.
Rabla's tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the Program to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural car park, launched in 2011, called Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
Linked to the Rabla Program, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were far too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program he managed to sell himself somewhere at 10 pieces.
“The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces and Mircea Oltean said.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those coming out, all the world's producers have looked at Romania, and these things I told you, and they have special policies.
“At all fairs is large agglomerations, all producers expose, come in all kinds of variants and underlined Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces about 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla program for tractors, started in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could surrender and instead received a voucher of 17,000 lei.
Red flag lifted
The internal vote of Labour seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his launch peak in future elections.
Rise and, therefore, the red-burned flag/ Under his skirts we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang in London's Sanctuary House yesterday.
He's witnessed a lot of deeds and vows. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left-hand anthem (the Red Flag) can search the internet and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and of those that fluctuate them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left of yesterday with tomorrow's, this love story between him and the Laburist Party base will have part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems premature to talk about the inevitable great election defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen elsewhere.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive scale.
The British Labours did not invent the voting system directly for the party leader in the western left.
For a few years, French Socialists have been working on a more complicated motion-based system that allows all members and sympathizers to express themselves; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the appointment of the candidate to the presidents of 2012.
However, the internal vote of the Labourmen seems more spectacular and more significantly political, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his launch peak in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, personalization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the Channel.
In addition, the participation in the vote was high in all three circles: members of the Unions, members of other organisations affiliated with the Party and, ultimately, the sympathetic group (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to engage more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, of course, no sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this outside and labuist research, and that cautious speculation is allowed.
I think we encounter a lot of attitudes similar to those of the sympathy of Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with observations that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an anti-system vocation and it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the centrist line, New Labour (for the sake of a dissimulated form of the long-hullite thacherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of which is that they did not go far enough left, that they did not delimit themselves firmly by the Tony Blair era.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Scotland's independence.
If we take away the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations for other political issues, we see how Scots nationals have captured the energies of public segments that favor the social state and are driven by equity aspirations, supporters of disarmament and hostile military involvement across borders, but also sensitive to the new issues of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish laborers thus lost an electorate to whom they should have, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm and Corbyn's campaign).
Like the energy there is everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, aristocrat and labuist.
Compared to Scotland, we are told more, I think, than the one with the left antisistem in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term anti-system is too hard: anti-establishment and it seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we'll learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as the opposition leader.
We'll see if there's any red flag in the House of Commons (not for the first time), after the new leader takes his place, in the first place of the opposing banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn wants now from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I went through my mind to check on the story of the former fighter and the Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh and became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his \"Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh\" (the two categories - \"rebel and \"jihadist - could themselves make me from the beginning of the circumstance).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and refugees and I commented in parallel two photos - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two facing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh took it from the article \"Syrian fighters come with the refugee wave and (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, I found, among other things, a handgun from my friend (not just FB) Marius Cristian: \"Subscription, except for a clarification. Laith al Saleh is not jihadist and
On the contrary, he is a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and that.
“That’s how you could add the coarse handling to the painting!
I have to admit, I felt nave.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through my mind to check on the story of the former fighter and the Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh and became in the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin his person the jihadist Laith Al-Saleh and (the two categories - rebellious and jihadist - could themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, in his journalists.
Instead, I had no other comment on the sleeve pull from Marius Cristian than so: “I need if I have (avut) confidence in the Truth and
After that, obviously I took the money and the story and I feel indebted to the readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found in a material of the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader is looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on Kos Island in Greece, where they noted, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man who was trying to order in the chaos.
The man was Syrian swindler Laith Al Saleh in Aleppo who usually held to be in command and since he won a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war and
We also find that Al Saleh, 30 years old, had had a home, a wife and a normal life before he started a fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put a third of the population of Syria on the road.
In the interview given correspondents from the Associated Press, Al Saleh tells the story that everyone wants to leave Syria and
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist Islamist group) wants me, the government wants me - I fought against everyone.
Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy: “Now two days ago, I saw a sniper in the government forces and
I haven't talked to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we learn that Laith (who is a lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he has a cousin - was a superior officer in the Syrian army and then became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then bring his family - wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an old man with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was successful, Laith Al-Saleh would not have ruled out a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (in the West) - against three forces: the army of Bashar Assad (in Russian support), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda affiliate.
A madness - those who want freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but three!
I've seen more of a Serbian material of 22 August, of which I don't understand much, except that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERRORISTI SE KriJU MEJU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a country on http://www.telegraf.rs/ vests, where they are joined a picture of Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in hand and that of the refugee in which she wears the shirt with shathanK YOU and
On September 7, then, himself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling with photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS figter posing as a refuge - This viral photo claims wrong that he looks like a fighter of the Islamic State putting in refugee.
We find that the picture (in fact: the pictures - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with THANK YOU) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have asked for excuses in the meantime.
Only before that, just from his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been taken more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That's too late, the horse was gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from the Hotnews takes over the story of the handling of BBC, yet mistranslated the title: “A false photograph became viral shows an ISIS fighter giving himself a refugee and
Obviously, not photography is fake, but interpretation was a fake, wrong, shorthand.
