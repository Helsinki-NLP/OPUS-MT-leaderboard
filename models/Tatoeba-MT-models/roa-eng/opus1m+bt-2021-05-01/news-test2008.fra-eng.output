Inflation in Europe has erupted on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was more important than the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
The official estimates indicated only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Contrary to the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that the decline in interest, with the growth of raw materials prices and the decline in unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: “It is necessary to deter inflation so that it will no longer have to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 percent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area took off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Cereal market rates have increased by 88 percent and soya prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
Food oil and milk products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will grow from 2.1, this year to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, within 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the steering rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz Alliance of Young Democrats has increased significantly since December. Thus since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Instituto de Probación) has never previously found such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would be, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hongrian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum des démocrates hongreis) and the SZDSZ (Ally des démocrates libres) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent across the population.
On faithful voters some vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate in comparison with the previous lowest point, with the proportion of those who felt that the economic situation in the country had never been particularly severe, rising to 41 per cent and 46 per cent complementary to the situation was rather serious.
After the more optimistic outlook for the spring and past summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population forecast an increase and only a tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of the people surveyed, a majority never seen in the previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather bad than good.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of changing the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing government.
While, after the riots in October last, 35 percent of the polls wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this rate represents only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote, and 20 per cent of the respondents said that they would probably vote.
In order to make the comparison, for a \"legislative election to organize next Sunday - only 55 percent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would make no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education registration fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the trade triangle of Buddhaörs have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, unlike this year's VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Dayly Economy)
This year, in the trade triangle of Budaörs, the usual Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value increase than a thousand forints appeared in all hypermarkets.
The prices, \"which had already flowed\" in the large food stores last December, have no longer risen sharply from the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the probed hypermarkets exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value in the basket stood at 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, however prices of turkey, nuts and peacock have increased sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, only one kilogram bread was found at 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle recorded included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of daily shopping, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan have increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket with the least expensive basket of this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between last year's lowest and most expensive year's is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rate was already seen in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade unclear, hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in prices of the daily Cart has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was greater than 1,720 forints at the value of 2006 while the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was greater than 1,630 forints last year and the lowest price increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some emergency supplies, the Institute of Statistics has observed an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent from the base.
According to the indexes, the flour suppliers hold a higher position than the egg suppliers because they have managed to have the brutal increase in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the trade gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-preserve food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, major tails formed at the three hypermarkets because the number of customers has risen sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to poll companies not even to reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The sanitary conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the over-handling of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the hospital's traumatology service János.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after he had to return because of an MRSA infection and since then the doctors have not been able to do a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
It is the number of infections caused by a multidrug agent that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we do not have any information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e., methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsilitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cureable.
However, if antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate way, the bacteria, which respond well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacteria that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as trauma infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, of small weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital daily.
Above all, the infection with the epidemic should not be confused, we do not find MRSA only the disease or are not looking for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
S.A.S. withstands antibiotics.
“These sick people are isolated, the caring staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them,” Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
The National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most of the cases occur only on the day if MRSA is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the management of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The achievement of microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that ARMs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, to put gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferated by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while, in the end of the epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save money on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable manner or the proliferation of the pathogens may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant spending on social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunkenness or storm, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Public Ministry of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former commissioner did not consume alcohol before embarking on the steering wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not going through the pedestrian crossing.
(In addition, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly disturbed him.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigations Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Hungarian Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, Friday, Budapest, three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund whose credit contract worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, and this time the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also covers the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
In the negotiations, the draft metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country, which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys in this EU market that is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most in vogue target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap seashore.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the seashore, Albena, the \"Sables of gold\" the \"Côte du sole\" the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasingly to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office areas promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in Bansko's corner.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria also seek to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old damaged houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since December, Bulgaria has been listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium- or long-term surplus value.
The price of capital buildings is increasing steadily due to an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, professional meetings are completed on Tuesday, but Wednesday, after official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this time, intensive discussions are being held between developing and developed countries on this issue.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss accurate figures, but that they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to the 1990 level.
Another important issue of the conference is whether developed countries undertake, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by an Executive Board of 16 members, probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), which announced Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its admiral vessel role in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of signing the \"After 2012 Agreement\", and was prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments appropriate to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol's signatory countries totalled 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members at that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be put in place in the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, an international scientific body, which was awarded the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth to more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits YouTube · Global Voices
British Army units provide video-sharing sites with records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to popularizing.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that was passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan were charging video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using mini-camera cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londrès or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is indisputable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this route and their \"chain\" was watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered itself as \"defenceheadquarters\" in spring 2007 and reports videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing in relation to the usual recruitment advertisements passed on to television, communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it warrants in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is ambushed because, apart from the videos composed and carefully censored, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the \"official\" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been made on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army had been packing for the loading of these videos only recently.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently by using the American's Army rifle game downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and dumplings in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her staff who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking snacks and coffee.
Another department will host a party with live music, another will charm the public with a tombol and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so enjoyed the power.
The public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the department who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the Christmas missionary, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will feast.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, over the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected to be held there.
At this feast, the atmosphere of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombol.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas festival which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the company manager of calls for tenders.
The building of the Gaîté Theatre has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building did not only host the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party started with the minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: evening service was not compulsory at all for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a celebration.
The Ministry of Health will hold a performance and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not formally invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to eat coffee and canteens, informed the press service, the party will not cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his staff to take a drink in the office of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
It offers to spend 2,500 forints per guest with a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
The official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the evening in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas celebration will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Wood, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, they have communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The League's unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, Friday, constitute their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important caps in traffic as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and BKV employees (common transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The League syndicates will inform, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be formed, it will be the coordinator of the Monday actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they do not reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Insurance Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the strike call immediately.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the follow-up to be taken.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only late at night or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important plugs are planned in the traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the transit in Budapest and more than half of Volán's companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the way will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, the list of them is updated continuously on the League site.
Some organizations report a strike for an indefinite period, others said a temporary job stop.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Road Free Union (VDSZSZ) have not been able to reach agreement on minimum services, or, at the approaching Christmas celebrations, more and more are those who take the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's joint transports will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and the Ligue Thermal Energy will strike four hours, the Professors' Union and the Professors' Democratic Union called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours at 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires the Government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and to submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be established from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to pass on the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Roadpath Free Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its \"risk warning\", the society reports that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is already that \"in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the worsening ethnic tension existing between the Tzygan and non-Tzygan population of Hungary\".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy, which is likely to lead to this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: \"public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzygans and the Hungarians.\"
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the work of the Hungarian and international media \"has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity.\"
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the \"national self-defense association\".
\"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, further, referring to the ineptitude of the police, the army, in other words the state,\" they added.
They pointed out that everything was in line with the method, which, based on the spite of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on civility and the status of association is therefore only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of these associations in the court but also to constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk to neighbouring relationships.
\"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,\" they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, the Constitution of which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma disorders that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to set up a guard, saying that the organization's objective was \"national self-defense.\"
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Tzygans have \"feared\" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, you can read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the telegraph agency Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occurred that could have an impact on the change of risk, they will inform the public, as in the present case, by issuing a warning of risk.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often associated with religious celebrations or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
Also, in a year, we have all eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as was October 23rd, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is the celebration of work and November 1st and 2nd, we remember the members of our family and of our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or it remains only a working day before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, public servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions turning without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year's holidays: from December 24th, life stops almost all over the country because according to the experiences most people make rather overtime hours or take holidays they have saved for these purposes so they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at their home.
The next year many parties fall in the middle or the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the labor feast to allow the employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day's work to have a day's rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23rd: Saturday 18th October will be a day of work replacing Friday 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced as from December 24, everyone will take a nonstop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six fucking things that can make colleagues terribly drunk
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that get us almost more attached: these are things that \"enjoy\" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these problems or we face the challenge and we are conscientiously avoiding ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
\"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you have been called a marketing service,\" a colleague said.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is helpful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them if they're right to be angry at you for getting their good.
Do not bring back envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and that you need them right away.
You don't care about your colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop pots that spread.
Who did what with who?
Or why?
Do not tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares her intimate secrets with you, don't abuse her trust!
Bury the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You call yourself sick for no reason?
When you call the office and say you're sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need some rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future tasks must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Freelance, rendezvous, phone
You're in your job, but you're being brutally scratched by the blackmail of your colleagues?
Have you, without wanting to, witnessed a conversation over the phone that you would have done better not to listen?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, chanting, loud-voiced discussions (that you lead over their heads), foot beats, big words or discontents expressed with a high voice.
They may bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (reading, design, organization).
Are you accusing others for one fault?
If your work is not done for the set time, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not accuse anyone for that forget!
Don't put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognise him if you've made a mistake and if it has presented inconveniences to others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian music life has not given us cakes for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the tap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital round begin gradually to change the overall picture and, despite the new style of the garage rock tearing off the guitar, the Hungarian electrop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own path, perhaps because \"there is no place for two feet in the same shoe\".
His project (Zagar) and music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records of the Hungarian market and to proclaim Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his group became unquestionably \"s trendy\" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group responded as needed, a new and better record was released.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Balázs Zságer Fish.
We are there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for radio, mr2 Petõfi, spreading from little to little the popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian-Underground Divas singers.
Everything is fine, then (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: is your music well remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aiming at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop, but commercial music and true music.
The so-called alternatives, underground music can also be poor and made only to sell them and become commercial.
However, a good pop song can be sincere as well.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially west, light music has older traditions.
La, people go to concerts and not only young people in the last decade or twenty years but also older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested to know who, and how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I am of course glad to see people coming more and more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not designed to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the inescapable changes of the moment.
I noticed, though, that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you'd be no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made careers rather west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead we are team players who have confidence in the other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of Mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many are the ones who heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube in order to sell the disc.
This song means more than anything.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the pride of sounds and the most difficult themes discussed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what were the guidelines?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choral.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus the choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song had existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought something was missing from this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short Judy Jay solo), they do not have a single role, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than music, so music does not only accompany their song.
They were behind the scene too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is from technical problems alone.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you the most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything came into place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already \"leaved\" this disc.
At the moment, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Trader's perfide to risk billions because of his inferiority complex
A smug fraudster.
As such, the former employee of the French giant is the Société General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
\"He is fragile,\" said his superiors, who denounced him to the police.
However, in view of Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
\"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank,\" he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called “sub-prime” mortgages granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
\"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it,\" Kerviel confides and adds that he, of course, didn't keep anything for himself.\"
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he has rejected the reports in order not to be dismissed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
That doesn't risk anything.
Was he afraid he'd be discovered?
Not at all.
\"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them\"
Where did he come from trying to risk so much?
He only managed to reach his position gradually.
He started working at the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Her annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant, and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
“Since my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course, he told the investigators Kerviel.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by stepping on the decline in this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
\"There was like a snowball effect,\" he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they doubted it.
\"When I won, they pretended to close their eyes.\"
Now, that's when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to conceal the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
\"Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another - concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and accounts for up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain in the context of these projects.
This will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of more efficient new management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's least successful fund beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (about 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and lived as a resident in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in function between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be incarcerated again, it is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at his house, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Aleman regularly moved the government's money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts were in fact the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Aleman had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's how it is.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the defiance statement to the government, this time there is nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some kind of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of power to oppose government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media, and that's why we pay more attention to it in the media.
Political disputes are much more relevant to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments were suffering from three problems that the current budget is not able to resolve at the same time:
The first is the important part of the law's mandate fees, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social burdens, adopted last year by the \"coalition\", silent between the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, the result of the first failure.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest inequality.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delayed bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, misappropriating their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatisations.
Today they no longer have this source.
In the case of official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase and ČSSD has not yet been sold.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they were increasingly in charge of the state.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls largely back on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
So we have no need for massive social programs that have, precisely in recent years, been unnecessarily infuriated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending that was approved last year before the elections was eliminated, if a retirement age gap and reform of the pension system did not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only administer.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes the regular costs to be dropped by the costs of mandates.
The projected deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments did not dissipate as much money as they could.
If we do not really want to make policies in power simply become bureaucrats, we need to be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what happens to take on taxes and tax rights, the necessary calm in the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be placed in monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, by auction system, the interest rates to which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and it will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent, or reduce, the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to the Economic Outlook Group consulting company’s clients.
\"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,\" adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect other losses in billions.
\"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be followed,\" says BN's Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
\"It seems that the situation is really bad,\" he added.
Central Banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could influence economic growth worldwide.
The Central Banks made this choice after it failed to lower the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the U.S., Canadian and English Central Banks had decreased their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates,” says Reuters Greg Salvaggio agency of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks approach will help to resolve the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to affect developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time struck the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric and reality.
\"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a fuss of words, make solutions to the current problems,\" Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is equally committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book would also appear in German translation, since, he said, \"I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions\"
As of now, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climate scientist, he nevertheless had enough provisions to write such a book.
He is an academic capable of monitoring and evaluating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics, and he is also a economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, in his view, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of the book are therefore normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, so they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
As he has experience with a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose inverified views on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against -a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring -
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have not been able to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their licence to drive especially those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipalities report a fall in the number of applications for licence renewal, the authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of applications for licence renewal has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 clients per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not succeed in carrying out the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will borrow the road without a valid licence, will be liable, as of January, to a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine goes up to 2500 kroner.
According to former reports, a person who was not going to move was liable to a fine.
In doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is a document, according to him, that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card that, she, must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should hand over their driver's license.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from the years 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conniving with the David Berdych gang, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague sentenced them to a final sentence of 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime were at risk of imprisonment for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he does not expect the trial verdict for the time being.
However, he has already received in other trials sentences, the amount of which exceeds 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty for participation in seniors 19 persons, and today the Superior Court dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants have questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after one agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang accounted for 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the charge, there is a question of the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999-2001.
Essentially armed robberys whose victims, in most cases, have suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of the power of a public agent and the prohibited weaponry.
In house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a visor for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men from this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other handlifted flights Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men from the vicinity of Berdych are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet come to court.
The main hearing for the time being avoided Tomáš Pŭta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The Children's Replacement Price: 12 million
Counsel of the left-wing families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation from the hospital of Třebíč of 12 million crowns plus expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of Ondřej Dostál hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
\"We refuse such a claim, it is very high,\" Dostál said on the way out of the hearing.
To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands - Dostál pointed out.
The amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million crowns each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital centre in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subjected to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been confronted with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
The women, they, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma, and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on 9 December last.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermak in Přibyslavive and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave, at the end of October, 100,000 crowns to each family for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are bound by law to insurance in civil liability.
In case of failure, they must put in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Up until now, the courts recognized relatively small compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polyvka lost Valašské Kralovství (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské Kralovství (Royaume de Valašsko) brand.
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who used for the first time the title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polyvka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
\"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about the popularity of Bolek Polyvka,\" said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko evoke this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
\"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
Money research and event development - he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work - he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polyvka used the valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) title for the first time in its television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it did not have to do with the project to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of showing Valašské Království passports.
From a humorous action at first there came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be cited in the passport and even offered the holders of the balances on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polyvka in the manéž issue, for commercial purposes.
“The popularity of Boleslav Polyvka certainly helped the project Valašské Kralovství,” said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between the parties today enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka an official crown in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polyvka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition - of King Boleslav 1 elected forever -
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, claiming that the court has now dismissed him.
What could make the case clear is the tournament for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date.
\"We don't want to go fast in need.\"
It would be something like the king's parade at Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register, said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, of driving and also of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
Now, there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, she, is significantly better.
The more the combo named SW goes a step further, the more I have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic pitchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there the complaints end because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, at ease.
Let's go check it out.
I'm going to talk very quickly about the inside so as not to repeat it.
This is a very successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, as the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or folders too short is turned.
Lateral driving has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive there too.
The combi also sees the lack of room above the head already mentioned.
A box in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its baggage support.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy arrimage.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop by the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is relative to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in Czechia.
Compared with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, with the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the cash left after the reverse of the back seats perfectly straight, or a very low footstep.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hitchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it pushes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a escape pod blocked by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that a rather well-equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litres engine rising to 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipes-glasses, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's only one left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is wrong
The number of children originating in Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among the unemployed about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find that conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are turning into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflicts between left-wing and Slovak immigrants are beginning to be emphasized, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicana and gangs between students have transpired into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with a iron rod.
The defendant defended himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenagers.
The girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks - he described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify conflicts with the survivors' struggle immigrants.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovakians come to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails.
kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enrich.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb described her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transhipment site of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20's.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mob, who made it build, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings have grown and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last century's 50', circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and the politicians of America as a whole left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars always move to Havana, since the jigouli and the already imported fiats have long been in such a salty and humid climate, rotting.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else around there are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have been pushed not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and will be especially appreciated by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extensive plantations in the sugars on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives that are not only in museums but also in contemporary ones.
Where to lead his steps?
Most visitors do not lack the best known places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales valley west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation pushes it on a limestone soil.
Mogots, calcareous balloons and rocks climb up the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil being taken into their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is grown.
You will be able to find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and of sugar that has brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth is embodied in the beauty and vitrine character of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná poudějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambiray, is a place so far apart that even in the 1950s, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stand aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over his head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth going to also see interesting places around, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is the custom to go to the Music House which is excited after sunset and where the music is absorbed only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this bourgeoisie located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way in which it goes.
The two roads that take you there from Guantanamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has entered Cuba's Eastern Equile, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it has seen the day about a hundred years after the Colomb period) and from the hill where the old chateau-fort is held and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Trues and the Island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled a number of pages.
Only, as we just say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment required, according to the United States, has a bearing on the conduct of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan was not carried out as expected, and representatives of troop-contributing countries in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, today the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops to a greater activity through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates this week, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and increased development assistance as a priority.
“The evolution of Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves, the British Minister of Defence of Browne told the BBC channel.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. Army data, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter are in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they request other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
\"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how they are achieved,\" Gates said.
The NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop has held similar remarks today.
\"I am not happy with what we have on earth and air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and the equipment we would need, and that's not enough -- De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Which is passive
The last few months also exist among the countries involved in the conflict on the question of whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the combat requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate - Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun described German soldiers as lazy this week.
\"The Fascian Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight,\" Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing on table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troops at a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of improved government budget savings, the department has reduced the expected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion krona by the end of September.
During the nine months of this year it has thus increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion krona.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state's debt from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with every Czech.
Throughout the past year, the state has committed more than 111 billion crowns.
\"For the time being, it appears that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of the Next Finance Analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: “We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the political situation changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change - he said.
Debts are rising
The state's debt is constituted by the central government's debts and is generated primarily by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government's debt is financed by treasury bonds, debt bonds, direct borrowings or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the State has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion krona to 123.3 billion krona.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached the end of September 803.3 billion krona and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion krona.
The average debt requirement of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
The total debt has increased inter-annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, much too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the debt securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is wrong for debt to increase, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a need to negotiate when pension reform comes - Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
It follows from the strategy for financing and managing the state debt for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of September, however, thanks to a better-than-planned state budget savings, the department has reduced the expected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit in the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Next, these are the maximum sources for the Czech consolidation agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state-owned debt bonds for 43 billion kroner and the repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
She was today appearing before a court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for insulting Islam was convicted on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum at 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years old to name a turtle bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a beating.
This 54-year-old British teacher, acting at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with reaching Islam and sedition under section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Sudanese Education.
History dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
“eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says the director of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend \"My name is Mohamed\".
The bear itself did not bear any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, \"I just regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name\", it is only a \"innocent error\".
It is shared by many students of the teacher who describe it as “very attentive to her students” and “who never talk about religion in class”.
Let's remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second most name given in Britain, he writes in 14 different ways in English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status,” said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
\"We do not expect violence in the immediate future, but we enter a very difficult period,\" he added, noting that \"obvious tensions exist\".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which are the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be coming to Serbia and Kosovo one last Monday.
The future of the province populated to 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was charged with further mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
\"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,\" Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's one-year administration, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
\"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,\" announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in Baden's hotel, where these \"last chance negotiations\" had taken place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade \"belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations\".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was always possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade said it would develop a \"domino effect\" in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
\"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that compromise is impossible.\"
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be made exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
\"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word\"
\"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,\" said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
\"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.\"
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that \"the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status\", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be \"in consultation\" with the West.
Bush drafts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference, meeting with his Tuesday care in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations to find a final settlement of the contentious age of 60 between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do all he could to help them conclude a \"peace treaty\" by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle — terrorist infrastructure — and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations to the “road map” for the peace they had accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim to - to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues -
This appeal covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the contentious between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be “globally and in depth” and address all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others”
In turn at the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to making the upcoming talks - direct and continuous - and to making - an effort to close them in the course of 2008 -
Bush set at the end of 2008 the time limit for the implementation of its two-State vision - Palestinian and Israeli that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because he attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, thinks Prince Saoud in his interview with the daily Arab-speaking Saudi capital.
For the prosecution, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in every instance in this type of diverse fact, official versions and rumours oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police Inspectorate (NPI), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
\"She was not in intervention but patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare,\" explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, \"unapproved, therefore not allowed to move on the public track\" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated \"very lively\".
\"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right,\" said a policeman.
The control of alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (formerly defunct, stoked windshield, torn bumpers) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation for \"facts of involuntary homicide and non-addiction to persons in danger\" to IMPN, which was done with the departmental directorate of the public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor states that the investigation of IMPN at this stage was not responsible for the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed \"the police's version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left.\"
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were kept locked up as long as the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have quickly left the scene, thus not helping the two young people.
The IMPN, while cautious, would also deviate from \"every serious fault\" concerning this point.
\"This is one of the most difficult aspects of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very cautious,\" said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows on the stage.
\"We immediately went down, with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to ransom them, he tells this witness.
There was nothing to be done.\"
He then saw \"a fully hagard policeman, who was boxing.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone.\"
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems to me, to the certainty that the people present the desperate situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues arriving on the scene.
According to this witness, the relief arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
\"I will not let you say that the police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them,\" said the prosecutor.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
They fought back by stone jets, hurting police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several of them were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar have called for a general strike and have announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties gathered in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' urged the people to send flowers to the judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and the debris to those who have sworn before Musharraf'.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly subject to the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
She had to decide in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the President's office on 6 October at the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was set aside and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings'', the magistrate said in The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president ''holds no more'' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
That he left his military uniform was expected by 15 November, after the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even now, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterille still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, according to Ined.
Contraception liberalization has also allowed for better \"feed mastery\", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated in the near month for a couple out of five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of work in space at astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated the records as a result of its duration, of its remoteness from the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, of \" bricolated\" tools by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts had discharged the Discovery shuttle from the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for the lab modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move an electricity production module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to place it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began relocating the solar panels of the module which have a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged on a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to perform an exit control of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform repair.
It is one of the best \"spacewalker\" of the Nasa.
Great, resistant, very good, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was charged with \"acting\" the \"injured\" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he sectioned the bad cable and installed \"gates\" in the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second \"spacewalker\" remained close to his and, on the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulating mini hockey cane to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and \"broken\" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline in the Paris stock exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its 2007 operational outcome forecast following the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) objectives for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to the electors on the public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He did so as the head of a united Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory he declared to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president had nothing to say by receiving the foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of predilection during the campaign.
\"We know the price of true democracy and wish honest, more transparent and open elections, and free elections,\" he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She denounces a campaign under pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there have never been such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsine.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former champion of the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
\"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet Homo\"
Behind these unsuspected legislation there are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the day of the presidential first round on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight a third consecutive term.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the powerful Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
Whatever the case, both the legislatures and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
\"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny,\" says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of the University of State of St. Petersburg goes back: civil society has slowed down in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, \"Putine has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more so as this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic relief,\" says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians \" willingly renounce personal responsibility\" which they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
“What good is it to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia together.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: \"What is good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?\"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, which were stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were only accessible so far for a \"humanitarian\" purpose, i.e. individual and nominative, upon request of an old victim or his/her legal guardians.
The 11 States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening of the agreement has been in effect since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow us to carry out research \"in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers,\" says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, objected to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, if possible, to provide proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
\"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,\" said Fr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, the Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light last April to the European Commission to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
\"A free trade pact operates enormously on both economies,\" and \"India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,\" said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange annually for €47 billion of goods, and for €10 billion of services, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England called it Thursday to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its expected supply of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation, as indicated in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that the BoE seems to put on the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
They usually go on for a week.
BoE adds in its press release that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain rates of interbank loans on-line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was Wednesday, 5,829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England's sums on the market have been accompanied by a significant penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumours, supported by the evolution of the book course in relation to the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the European Central Bank's money placed on the market, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounted to rejection of the text.
Inscripted in a \"nice-socialist\" (meeting of the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion which resulted in sometimes lively exchanges between majority and opposition at a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The head of the MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Sees the Day
Following many rumours about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
\"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no matter how much less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America,\" Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the stand at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracted some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the \"most inspiring event\" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival.
\"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in central Philadelphia,\" said Charlie Jones.
\"We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
\"We have been able to discuss this with Melvin Benn and we are ready to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.\"
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having entered the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
\"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces,\" said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge the two formulas in one way or another to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban American.\"
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
\"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,\" said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states \"that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.\"
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is \"very large\", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were made to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press.
\"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators,\" said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film plateaus to Montreal when no other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the post of delegate.
A term - \"politically difficult\" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the \"runaway productions\".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the Governor?
\"We must be cautious, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,\" he said.
The Festival Race
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscar race started.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors conduct interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a nice showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year fellowship rally? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Within five weeks of the year's closing, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that, from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock exchange generally has positive behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make estimates solely based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are seen in markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of boosting the stock market during the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that, thanks to the existence of liquidity, they are willing to invest due to the lack of collateral alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the leak effect to quality values both in long periods and short periods,
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will be rather side-by-side, not free from volatility - especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions -
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing” assures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish Bourse Index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed to 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points thanks to the reorganisation of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert who knows that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analyst, assesses that we are close to the technical levels, and that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be generated based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that this year the great values are back for him.
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers - since when the date comes, the electrical sector will be very expensive -
Whereas, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event that it is put in place.
“ACS has been recovering from positions for several months and we hope that the other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only on two occasions in December was a low month.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the perception of the technology bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds on its year-end rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open from 12 a.m. Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to adhere to or not to this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the street trades chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies across Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colours.
The bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Worldcredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
' We do not want to compete with our clients ', notes Rivero.
For the moment, they came to an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in Stock Exchange of his rival Antenna 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate advisor from Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: 'what hurts me, it is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered less', he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, 'we have fallen less '.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a progression of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value in Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antenna 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in Sogecable's case; 2,518.53 million in Prisa's case (the Five Days publisher) and 1,779 million in Vocento's case.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we profit in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues this year, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this actual announcement, the television channel is expected to record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net invoicing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is giving signs of fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of the earnings from Antenne 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
The company Ibersecurities recommends buying both values based mainly on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which today ended with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activities of the agencies in detail to ensure that the markets function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Law of the Market in Values, implies the modernisation of financial markets, when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Committee of the Market in Values (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consultation services both for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which merge securities companies, stock agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for carrying out operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep a register of all the operations they carry out, in order to facilitate the control by the CNV.
By going through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the held debts will be considered as a financial instrument - complex - given its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delimit the functions that graduates in the economy may have 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNV and who will be able to lend its marketing services of products and the attraction of new customers to various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed next December 14.
-The CPI will continue on relatively high levels -
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, affirmed that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a time figure, but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on levels - relatively high - in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the corridors of Congress that - although the figure is not good - Spain's inflation differential over monetary union continues to be - more or less - the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November - there was less surprise - than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
\"We were waiting for a figure around 4 per cent,\" acknowledged the Minister of the Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At this point, he was stocking a few record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the British bank's incomes that will be deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson moat group, known for its campaign to create advertising in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of Virgin's association, to which three other companies participate, including her favorite to save her from the bank.
Totana's mayor was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
Today, in the early morning, the Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me as the last May Juan Morales, the current right-wing deputy, and so far the municipal councillor of the city, who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'manor' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Board of Urbanism and there is no possibility of further arrests within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, a leading suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the Chane Ser said yesterday to the MP's lawyer 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged commission of Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to be at the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the Spanish Socialist Party's organizational secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because - it is important to count on the best - in political life and Bono - is among the best -
In addition, he stressed that, yes, it seems, the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group that will preside over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who issued his decision not to attend the forthcoming general elections and give up his political career in order to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context on 15 November.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce to the president of the Congress in an act of transparency.
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into a house of respect and not of insult or cry, and to make it increasingly like citizens.
\"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local in Madrid where we can't speak quietly and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times\"
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and - they know how to do - and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his position in order not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might regard as \"a domination\"
A Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjected itself to unmerciful persecution, as well as the skeptics of its predictions, as well as those giving priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even intends to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it was produced and why its Government, in the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is to say, it will sacrifice itself and pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Up to the one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has appeared to Zapatero so dangerous that he has undertaken to deny it.
That is to say that it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he does not speak, that he does not denounce and that does not require, he embellishs meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move into a bicycle or cool with the window.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the \"popular\" - José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today informed sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hotel, where at the time many officers met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Council of Urbanism and to the Municipal Management Company of the Sol Industriel and the Housing.
These three judgements are in addition to the six judgements made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructs.
The first six detainees were brought to court today.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a registered real estate agency in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal advisor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was therefore arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a very well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with \"spa\"
The company acquired 2,2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Catolico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday published in Finland's most important newspaper (certain leading PISA information above the world's educational level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
The content of the Philosophy course appealed to public opinion as a result of Jokela school's tragedy.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosopher's Education Adviser, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato about what is written on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the lycées.

A colleague passes information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime punishable from six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a six-month to two-year sentence
(article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films and without permission of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My treating physician told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'The money produces brain activations, especially if the others get less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: \"The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed\"
The researchers observed that when both people became aware that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague for eight years.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with an bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list, the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'Carla' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York, who continues the fugitive criminals and exerts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I have?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, implies an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or the use that is in fact done, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is based on an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident is, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have lower claims than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the probability of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with an insurance contract at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and driving license seniority.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, other more economic options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for a free risk insurance, so that they obtain the coverage of any risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the disaster.
\"The portion of the damage the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower,\" explains Luis Noguera, the official in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Advice.
If you are a 25-year-old, try to be careful and avoid the disaster as far as possible, as it will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
- Bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it may allow itself to increase the bonuses - clarified Noguera.
Over the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers when entering into a contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose a risk insurance with freeness of choice.
\"Youths generally cannot benefit from the prior experience acquired after an accident,\" says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the lowest in the accident rate, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk at all free of charge (may be EUR 300), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
\"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises,\" explains Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, insurance at all risks with free will is preferable (i.e. EUR 150), or extended third party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighths of the finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be the first and the Scottish to rank.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass before him.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC must compete with the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the final of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage appears to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at them and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighths of the finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of ranking for the eighths of the finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoners' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighths of the finals in order to continue the league of the UEFA champions.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is the last and without any opportunity to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attending the first concert at the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Push Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group's meeting was brilliant.
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the history of the group that raged in the late 1990s is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes its main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage showing the bracelets the husband of 'Push Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show.
' Sporty Spice ' who was a member of the group in 1998 - because of differences between us - and who caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview two hours before the start of the show.
\"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings changed, and the Spice Girls' feelings changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision - Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, - things have been arranged and we appreciate it a lot -
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby-sitting army was waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is a warning.
A fierce gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-provided monopoly, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as expected, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts have stated that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
\"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,\" said Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh, to the Reuters news agency.
\"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine\"
The last major alteration between Moscow and Kiev resulted in the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations from the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its non-Community employees to verify that they have prior penalties, the Monitoring Committee said.
The General Reverend Robert Black's warning occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed concern that the Ministry of Scottish Health had no specific data on the number of overseas persons it employed.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer general carried out checks on extra Community staff following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin serving the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having sunk with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, because he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the numerous warnings, the report of the reviewer general now states that the committees are required to confront the Office for the Control of Past Criminals, thus enabling employers to undertake controls over various countries.
\"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been well verified, it is not done at all times,\" the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health conducts most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he added: \"Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas personnel is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said that it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
The report stated that pre-employment controls carried out at present are functioning well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value.
The Scottish health authorities stated that 1161 people were employed overseas, consisting mostly of doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general pointed out that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of undetermined staff members, who may choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities control in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are entirely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its pre-employment control policy and system for personnel beyond the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: \"I was excited to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.\"
She added that the Scottish Government allied to health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio peak on the last singer of Joy Division, Ian Curts, has raised 5 awards, including the best film, at the Oscars of the British Independent Film.

The film in black and white, whose musical band was made by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of barely 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree from U2, has won two awards, the first as the best director and the second as the best player in the beginning.
The Rock has also been rewarded with the award of the Best Documentary Award awarded to Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The best actor's price was given to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller performed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his coricultural performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who played films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the following Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crian of Crystal.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this prize, named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me to have access to cinema,\" he said.
\"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.\"
\"I was admiring before this great actor today, I was extremely honored\"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as \"the Bifas\" are attributed by a jury composed of film directors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia block 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed having arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on a petroleum site, as well as attacks on clergymen and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda's supporters staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqiq.
The newspaper quoting a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a \"missile launch expert\" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the eight-missile gang in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees would appear to have plotted the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against Saudi leaders in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Muslim Shiite government allied in the United States, considered to be heretical according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the Saudi pro-Western government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi-origin Al Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,\" said the spokesman for the Minister of the Interior on state television.
Among the inmates, there are 16 members of the Medine organized into a \"media cell\" to promote \"takfiri thought\", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostatized Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European orbiting ship have shown that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to all other kinds of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead there.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the survey of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad view of the future potential of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: \"We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
\"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, may even be with a habitable surface.\"
Uranium enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that this is uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Again open to all
Mitt Romney said that he was not up to the task of being a presidential candidate to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who had recorded their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that arising from another debate by You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position regarding the warming of the planet.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected a great deal of the conditions of the Republican Party, a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard things that were fun: The government raised approval increases when candidates expressed themselves rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, head of the major early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his New York City mayor's term.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be ready to promote an \"amnesia\" (offering the illegals a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be thanks to the fact that they started to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
Generally speaking, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, allied to the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourage the Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether watering in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in its entirety, in the Bible’s contents.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - at the Iowa post in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand in the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistleblowing in the Wednesday debate.
The two of them emerged from the child, thanks to the fact that the two party protectors fail to agree to decide who is the most well-known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in good time and convincingly with a message of success on the American size thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shady; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra suceeded marital toe.
But here's a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have enjoyed.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back into his draft election, foolishly insulting British intelligence declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The repurchase of Northern Rock, a difficult bank on the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a failure of the guidelines and poor judgment in case of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change in the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, a Protestant against reductions in military expenditures: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of donations cast by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going untiringly to the exit.
However, governments may reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but they generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the ministers' offices are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any more objectives.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he wished to repudiate Tony Blair, he was also his superior lieutenant.
Northern Rock issues and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the lengthy inquiry into the party's funds \"of money counting for members of the House of Lords,\" voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation facing Mr. Brown is not so tragic that it seems to be.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories Party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown forever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
A very special character, Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, stated that he did not wish any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big politicians' grantors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr.Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the person responsible for the collection of subsidies that had spoken suspicious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made after his arrival in the government in June.
So far the prime minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on something he knows well, using an inquiry committee on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law is out of order, it's in the police's power.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, with no leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would require the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan as Mr Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to gain a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Flash cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see sharp fins, whirl around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators target the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
There are clear signs of tension.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the share of the balance sheet that is not recoverable or which is not recoverable, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card bearers.
It's just too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal bankroute caused an abrupt fall in bank records, which in turn resulted in heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of the capital of credit cards is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers could prefer to increase their debt now that fair property loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of borrowing; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repair the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
\"We are not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowings.\" said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there are high risks of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go testify to a fraud committed by the previous financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for collusory alleged fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of having committed fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous all over Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations made to them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, called the three of Natwest, declared to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call the bankroute procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £ 1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest to that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow allegedly falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went to the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two plots in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its slum speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion loss of market value and over $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former president-general Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
No sauce, no outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
\"He can carry up to 18 passengers,\" said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
\"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company.\"
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Salon des Millionaires, an orgy of consumer incitement, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their diverse products, ranging from acajou yachts to diamond-filled cars like 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer was scouring a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
\"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product,\" he said.
\"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.\"
\"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas\"
\"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic.\" said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Harvard.\"
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerged as the world's largest expense.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, which are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research centre.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
\"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all there,\" said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She attended the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Soho Bijotier Group.
\"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.\"
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare themselves to be their clients, millionaires.
\"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,\" said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high sewing dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to tail in the stoppers to come to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
\"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands,\" said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal porcelain factory stand in the Hollandaise Delf, in front of a Raimbrant wall panel on blue tiles, handmade.
\"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in the bling bling\"
Indeed, the sellers have stated here that the Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years are too high according to Russian standards) have already passed off from striking logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold in the living room.
Despite this, thousands of people, that is, millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, spread the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil's beds, declared having sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also declared that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three similar cars to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted her to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel of roulette.
The set of four costs $22,000.
\"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,\" said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term \"Russian millionaire\" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
\"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if not in case,\" he said.
“There’s more that you could think about”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with counterfeit dollar masses.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Stunned passersby to launch mass tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the midst of this false wealth or impoverishing a few million.
\"you see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire,\" said Mr. Karyev.
No suspected homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's Eve when Ronald Livingston watched over the glass bay at the restaurant Just a little Healthier and watched an ambulance just stopping at the door of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Next comes the police patrol.
And then another one.
\"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,\" said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unaccredited cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, residing on 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they expect confident, the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should enable to solve this mysterious death that has tarnished the high ranks of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenace,\" McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\"
\"she was like a pit bull\"
\"She would have done everything to protect me\"
McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Board, and left two children aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for the Union County prosecutor's office, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
\"It's a possibility to consider.\"
\"the investigation continues.\"
The authorities declared that they had arrived at her house about 15 hours.
and found Melle brooko on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical firm.
Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro where a cast rose was lying in the narrow cemetery ahead, and a Dalmatian was aboding in the back.
A blue cane called \"Etyl Vanillin - used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, was lying in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the underground.
Two bikes all land hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her to navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
\"she said \"you must pay attention to this,\" he said.
\"She was there when I arrived, and again when I was leaving.
\"It was embarrassing.\"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rates associated with the ffervescence of the world stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice-president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, no. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide must be \"flexible and pragmatic\" in their actions in the active financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence had in part \"reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this harsh turbulence was to persist, it would increase the chances of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These comments also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing interest in real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are provided for in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, 2.5% reaching 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165,5 points, or 2.7% ending at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for a sale to the monthly tri-fund auctions of the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into the London financial markets resulting in credit tensions has caused the British banks to increase their highest monthly three-monthly borrowing rates since September, to 6.59% following a strong rise since 12 November.
England is facing a call for judgement in relation to the critiques of Owis Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the n°6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second issue is important because David Graveney, the president of the selections who was there exceptionally to assist Peter Moores, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the President General of England, is starting to complete the application forms to become a national selectioner, at least on a part-time basis.
The one who won't win the st.6 will be rude, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to anticipate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck more than because of a lack of skill.
There is not only cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is this just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee \"tubby\"?; both, new managers who have obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only one place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer has to capture the Captain's eye, at the same time he has to take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cracker one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed sure to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 front-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both of them have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer even more.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's going to play Asgiriya stage, that's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could undermine or build a man's career, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful turns, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-cent marked against Australia may still be under consideration.
The probability provides that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
They both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88th test in Bombay, 32-cent first class versus six for Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Middlesex Player's Test, his town of the Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectioners when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have affected his apparent momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, the sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his crewman who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his glowing look allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normality.
Some have returned to fight against militants who have alienated them from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in dozens of bus convoys of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
\"I decided to go to Syria after killing several doctors in Baghdad,\" said Dr. Sunni Sabah al-Qubaisi.
\"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seeing that the city is safer now.\"
\"They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!\" he said, referring to Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and the regime prevents the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-aided militia, allowed Al Qaeda to be hunted from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he induced citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
\"Two days ago, some of my friends called and told me to set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.\"
\"That's why I'm coming in today,\" said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since the U.S. troops arrived, and in view of the ongoing formation of \"groups of citizens involved\" armed and working with the American military to defend their neighbours.
But others say that they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exile visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
\"we did not have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,\" said retired Sunni.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were hunted out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will not increase sectarian tensions again and bring the fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest fed state is in vocational training, and it is even shining from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
\"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French - - it is the slogan that the smallest fed state, by self-defence, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the instructor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads children from the country to higher schools in numbers higher than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
\"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system,\" said Axel Plünnecke, IW training expert.
More than one in five young people get their diplomas in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Therefore, the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarroi Education has forced higher schools to market in engineering science.
\"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools.\" says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of day care is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether student performance improves sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the rate of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And despite the sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise points could be gained in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if sarrois are not French.
Chavez regulates watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tick other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring back the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Vénézuela communicated, by means of a new law, the watches will be settled at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified its position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Chavez also announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
\"I can't, because of my dignity,\" said Chavez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw the mandate of negotiations in Chavez on the liberation of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have ‘scraped to the face’ of Venezuela with this decision had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain also Chavez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ring rages in the country: \"Why don't you shut up\" (why don't you like it) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interpellations of the left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
A decrease in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real lower wage value threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect in 2007 a real decrease in their payroll compared to the previous year.
\"Failure is due to the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices,\" said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Research on Conjuncture in the journal \"Bild\"
New employment insurance charges could also be used for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper \"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung\" that the planned drop in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to request credit or financial aid from the Federation, in accordance with the words of the SPD politician.
It was found on Tuesday that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe - Venus Express - has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lights on Venus.
The European probe - Venus Express - has now proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus explode at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud in the cloud, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine -Nature -
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: the orage would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: \"If life has been there, it must have been at a very old date in history,\" says Sean Solomon of the \"Carnegie Institution\" in Washington.
There should not be a lot of living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
\"Venus is perhaps the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin,\" Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of \"Venus Express\" in November 2005 was an important step in the Venetian research, since no probe was on the way to explore this planet since the ninety-seven years.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of \"Nature\" do not just highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than the first ones assumed.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a whirlpool of clouds at the south pole, which is much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star of night or morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party quarrel about the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPDs for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and sums up the great coalition to close the quarrel about the Dalai Lama's reception.
\"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue,\" Köhler said in Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
\"Human rights have universal validity, although I have respect for differences between cultures,\" Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany should keep a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not take his distance from the traditional politics of only one China.
“China also knows,” Köhler said.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, about the CDU’s ‘outstanding policy’ in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations made themselves felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only ordered the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel's information, also broke the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires the German chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, so Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that it attempts to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fights with police, shots, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Everything must be implemented to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets because of violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
Barricades that burn, cassers that pull on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not constitute ourselves and defuses itself in violence.
We must take this seriously, he said to the \"Neue Presse\" in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to get away with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the communes were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
-There are summits for integration into the Islamic Conferences, and this already shows its first success -
But it would be too early for a warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems, nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian agglomerations of the north, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the “immitation effects”
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the share of unemployed persons in young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
First and foremost, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: \"We must give young people a perspective\"
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families was more effective in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: \"But we must still be cautious\"
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities in position reported three arrests as well as some cars and trash burned.
Since the conference, the deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has been calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the troubles overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopian stage of the chancellor shows that the coalition ended with the background - and that there is nothing to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live justly?
After his dismal speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she's just shown that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate that reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a polician in waiter, who fled into foreign policy and who even there remains in the afterlife.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes and still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would still have refused it two years ago.
Now it's cramping with all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
This is where she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, the problems of domestic policy are marginal.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for that.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times in which it is lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to deliver a half-specified sentence.
It holds in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate of Youtube of Republican candidates to the presidential, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already exploded on the first subject.
He would have made New-York a \"refuge for the clandestines\" -- Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter, for his part, was gravely reproached: “I would say his own house was an illegal herd,” Giuliani replied, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are attacking: since the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
\"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,\" John McCain urged his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called \"Waterboarding\" a method of interrogation where we simulate drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future increases in taxes are denied, applause in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites reside again.
“I made a mistake at the time,” explains Romney, “and apologized to the base and to the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, passes through a knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, the Pakistani man of power Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his charge as Chief of Armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus succumbed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers in his ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the Chief of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s are playing again: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared the recordings of their great success \"Live 1974\"
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63, was a middle throne in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed throughout the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, bends over his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertence to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has secured a few emos among the lovers of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case is so durable that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is called \"Krautrock\" has always been more widespread in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work in 2003, the German pop-faces questioned were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegeric praise, the wonder had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in self and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is that already taken by Harmonia, because the trio was only two years old and during that period, the impact power felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-funded label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked out in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as a guitarist with Snow!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
Towards 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland Forests.
There, in an ancient farm of the Weser, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community - Kommune I - where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a phallion of choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmonia far from that.
The first album was called \"Musik von Harmonia\" and the next \"De Luxe\" album.
Because the music was also serene and playful, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve on its own in search of self.
The CD-Live 1974 - which has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone who thinks he remembers.
Rother then issued the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as \"Flamende Herzen\" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the nineties and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We owe Herbert Grönemeyer's Live album to Griessem.
Its label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been found on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book -Krautrock Sampler -
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence plans in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: \"The only true music, you listen to the future\"
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white pictures of cabled tools in bazaar are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and the battery, to shoot instruments from sounds that are unwieldy thanks to instruments with built-in effects themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them in great technical firecrackers.
That's what the choral of the house will do.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the shade of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment - Aaaaaah - with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been a rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who yells -68 - is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia also now does not allow himself to be irritated by that now.
But what goes on most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can tap into someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With \"The Hunting Party\" and \"Death Peace\" two films once again address the war of the Balkans.
But they both don't.
Either the projects are based too much on action and the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too larming.
Here, even Richard Gere in \"The Hunting Party\" can't help.
The good news first: the Karadzic and Mladic war criminals are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but this is right there, in the farthest country of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the nineties, because much too many gentle and futile roles in sentiment movies for women and much too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism have delighted him to show himself.
Today, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at the \"The Hunting Party\" - when the hunter becomes the hunted one (why do today's films have to be as long and confusing as collective locomotive drivers conventions?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of eye-clining: at the bottom, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But in spite of this, \"The Hunting Party\" continues together with German production, which also comes out this week, the endless suite of films missed on the Balkan War.
De-Paix's murder - the trial can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovars snipers, in which one of them is still quickly falling in love.
Although it is welcome that once Serbs are not presented as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a sort of - Alarm for Cobra 11 - without motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of The Hunting Party - why in the background there has never been a true film on the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to paint the high war criminal - the fox - might have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another point a new \"Apocalypse Now\"
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of \"The Hunting Party\" is that one simply does not leave Simon Hunt to be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to give him more of a romantic adventure with a Bosniac murdered later.
Then — The Hunting Party — becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for fair vengeance to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to conduct the hunt sufficiently intensive due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: \"Compassing, I see the veins of the bloated forehead, clearly: as it is tiring to be mean.\"
Films such as \"The Hunting Party\" have exactly such tumescent heads, but insinuating how tired it is of being good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large flops.
We can add that there have never been good films on South Africa yet.
What matters every time: when a star pulls on a crisis home or on a minefield, he then sort something like \"Rangoon\" with Patricia Arquette, \"Jenseits go Grenzen - with Angelina Jolie or \"Blutdiamanten - with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all of these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good movie on the holocaust with \"The Schindler List\"
Some films still need to mature - those that are worth classical works today on Vietnam - The Deer Hunter - -Apocalypse Now - or -Full Metal Jackett - have in no case been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know today too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights the scenists the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“Being or not being” or “The dictator” have in fact become as good as Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the artistic sarcastic and distant look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel - the Lemprier Dictionary - and the Balkan War, he replied: \"It is only because some things never change\"
\"The great cities will always be horrifyingly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrible way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia\"
Von Beust reaps criticism for the abolition of the Olympiads.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympics has been met in critical politics and economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls realism in the appreciation of chances.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday a abandonment as \"bad for the local economy\"
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the Olympics did.
\"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures\"
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, which takes another modified agenda as its starting point.
Mayor Ole von Beust remained there on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
‘This is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports,’ said Von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December regarding Munich's nomination for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the time span that we had planned until 2028, we will not have any chance.
However, the dream does not belong definitively in the past, Von Beust said.
The Sports Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
That would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
\"It is too early to close up an opportunity, burying the projects already now,\" said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidature would be further in contradiction with the statements of the Senate Chief on the occasion of the reception at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have named Hamburg's application to the University of 2015 as not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction appealed to the Senate not to have used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Small Grassbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics map and excluded housing construction,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a later use of the dwellings, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the \"Event Factor\"
The nomination for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games would have for its part raised in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg had broken down against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' boxes.
He who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety-six Brillo-Boxes of \"Type Stockholm - listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" had questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today resulted in a dissensing result: the six-Brillo-Boxes, whose former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave gifts in 1995 at the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of \"Type Stockholm\" Brillo-Boxen - who circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is covered, a string disconcerting artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first - Brillo-Boxes - painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of powder soap cartons - Brillo -
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - of hundreds of boxes of Brillo made of cardboard: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce a few boxes of Brillo wood in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden caisses de wood that at the time would have entered law in the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the appellation - Type Stockholm -
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten Museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have handed over to him.
Indeed, the 105 boxes of Hulten were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three others of Swedish private collections, including two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and punced, then applied with a brush of white oil painting.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was applied directly without a layer of background on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
\"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes - let the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: \"If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't come another decision, the Moderna Museum will rank the six boxes in its collection as copies/material of exhibition -
Already in July, the Athentication Board, of course, announced that it would investigate the “loud accusations” that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there with an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had rebooted in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers faithful to power had recently attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been torn apart for hours in the building.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday because of a missing putsch attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathists.
The military police, who were normally to monitor them, had apparently deserted in their favor and joined in their mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power close the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
\"We call on people to join us\"
General Danilo Lim, who was commanding before the elite unit of the Rangers Scouts, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by corruption complaints.
The Manila Finance District has already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of approximately 200 members of the Army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versailles.
The United Internet has engaged more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated previously on a repurchase.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versailles.
With this step, we seek to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market, the United Internet has been communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, we are told on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 percent participation in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
In the context of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in Stock Exchange.
United Internet bought 5,15 million for 31,1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on co-operations in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
\"We strengthened our partnership,\" explained a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies founded the company in MSP participation in order to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and do not use their right to donate 18.49 percent more at Freenet, trusted United Internet Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all the options open, particularly to increase participation in the SA Freenet, we have learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet which has been part of the German telecoms market for months.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch had so far a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent additional.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
