The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half of the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended about 6%.
The downfall this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the Secretary of the Financial Sector, is also expressed here.
Fall of shares in Asia
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Scholarship Index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decrease by almost 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises index following Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, Shanghai markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions planned in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said the Head of Hong Kong Bank Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, i.e. without reliance on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruddd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make falls feel in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to assist the financial system to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the actions collected the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones's index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American finance system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators brought a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, President of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be taken in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Later, however, it will reach the \"decantation\" thanks to the complex mechanisms that will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
We've made a great advance.
We resolve our conflicting views regarding the way the package of measures for market stabilization should have been put in place - said Democrat Nancy Pelosia to agency Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and also need to be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it,\" Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis is specifically concerned with the rapidly falling stock market.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything they can to make Congress definitively approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time slot and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when they will vote on the two chambers of the American Congress and, not even, if they will not get stuck at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it felt that the programme did not perform its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained, which consisted of earning financial resources for the buy-back of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish their mortgages.
We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday - said Senator Republican Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that he values - the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy -
Limitation of the armoured contract
Senate Banking Committee President Christopher Dodd, chief negotiators, said that legislators decided on the responsibility of the money programme for the protection of taxpayers' taxes for their losses, a easing of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called armoured contracts for directors of participating companies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
He would have to run it by the Ministry of Finance.
\"We've worked very hard on it, and we've made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,\" Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower monthly payment charges at the debtors' time and make it possible for them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult.
This is why we do not know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government - Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
The most important thing is that, this week, congressmen agree on their support and give them their good vision as much as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval will come about is, at present, the most important thing - Marek insisted.
Armed combat: the MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern record to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, these types of musical products such as LP records are no longer available, and as far as their quality is concerned there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl discs with music from art rock, jazz or blues are caught on their shelves, you're probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on its way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty crown merchant helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that not even most of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, playing music and video, recording the two, having a better or worse camera and even getting to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to do a barbecue and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile the screen indicator will be illuminated by requesting recharge.
And music reproduction is one of the biggest energy beams.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they constantly call themselves to get even, for more safety, a charger for the work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem is when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used on the mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order only in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices show only a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular team, be interested in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will hear it every day only for a while, as in the streetcar, then you just have any mobile to play.
Which practically gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all, and virtually all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough by means of the mobile internet to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and to buy a song or album.
This service could by itself be a weight argument to acquire a music mobile.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success themes of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, this way of selling music (either by GSM, the Internet or the wireless internet) is supposed to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry on a mobile.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether she always wears some headphones or, at least, handsfrees.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest are usually less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the recordwriters are evident.
It does not pose a threat that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and therefore gigantic account for data loss.
Which apparatus to decide
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach the 2,000 crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only one 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy still a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding lovers of music hand over the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as for price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most arria brand mentioned brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still have something missing - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long to arrive.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is of the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming rates it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, said that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with their own network no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entrance of the virtual operator to the mobile phone market brought a marked decrease in prices to which the classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in Britain, similar voices were heard there as well as here.
It has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year did this operator get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order to be able to function effectively, they have many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world these types of virtual operators are usually low-cost - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, are often countered with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cost in relation to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it may also be a good blow to bet for a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
\"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator he likes and who can be trusted\" says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if such a similar concept as that of Poland could stick in our country.
The Vodafone spokesperson, Miroslav Čepický, doubts this.The Czech market is relatively small to be accessed by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the provision of services, it is relatively saturated -
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there are any virtual operators in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region - he said in phone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competition.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it by the Novera GTS group that would like to take a step forward to become a real O2 Telefónica competition in the field of business customers.
We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance the meetings, said the group spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they're flashing better times.
It appears that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive at the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
At present we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field - expressed for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with the opinion of O2, adds: \"To date we have not recorded any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop\"
And he adds: “In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study on such a short horizon -
Vodafone directs its attention rather to meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the allocation of expenditure and infrastructure.
We regard this as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is found in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile-
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can easily be understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would result in a price drop and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by T-Mobile society.
It attests to the public information accessible on the websites of the ČTU.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “Besides, the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market has not long since been open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the market for mobile telephony in the Czech Republic it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would imply for him and, above all, for his services great requirements -
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously disheartening due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance towards this problem.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after a convention on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator is closed.
To date, no convention has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not sufficiently interesting for the classic operators - it added to our question Kristián Chalupa, from the department of External Relations of the UOHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of operators.
For the offices that should represent the interests of consumers, this is something more than consideration, apart from that they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “On the outside where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the low price of mobile telephony services”
Of course, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market means and the price reduction does not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
The dramatic shock in all of this is really the result of the dissonant reactions of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a chance is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
The Office has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore have a corresponding rise in liability in their market performance.
The necessary tools to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators, added to their response Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
There is, of course, a relevant market analysis developed by the ČTU that telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary agreement with the network administrator.
And the operator of mobile telephony - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should represent a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
The current complaints made by stakeholders (inhibited by the so-called GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a quite common trick in the field of telecommunications that the ÚOHS washes hands on all this matter.
We've met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the expansion of ČTU's competition in the field of commercial tenders that had not been carried out was recently tabled, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is evident that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks.
At the same time, it clearly continues to work something as well as a pseudovirtual operator that in Czech mobile telephony networks there already exist a few.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services which, however, only part of them are public.
These are usually companies that engage in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same in charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such resale.
“If cases such as those cited could be found to speak of infringement of the terms of contract that could be translated at the end of the collaboration with the given society,” answered the question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three companies cited it can become thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get a profit that is not negligible and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems:-The law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a despicable so many percent of customers.
These, moreover, must accept that the SIM card on your phone is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators -
This is precisely what should look like the least strange ČU.
There is also a new question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile phone operators are looking at this type of procedure, why are they blocking the virtual operator's entrance?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has enough competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it must not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases defended operators but their clients.
It was already with formal measures or informal pressure that led to the emergence of the first virtual operator and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
We cannot help but be impressed by the confusion of the powers in these cases.
But let us not despair.
If this information between developers is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech market for mobile telephony probably starts moving again.
If one of the operators lets some virtual mobile phone operator enter it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may no longer call more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded it by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are available four versions - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and one with female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
About the corner are Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek sees this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said before that it intentionally elected for the solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
\"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, also, with the Chorus which were fixed in the dictation so that the text would be well understood, so that it had consonance,\" he commented.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first played in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became naturally part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the \"new\" sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be acquired at present by nearly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it on their chip card at the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Mŭstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonds can be purchased from the transport company's pages on the Internet from yesterday, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of trade, can definitely start to forget about ticket sales in the subway stations, where so far they had to queue regularly to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card recharges it to one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a window with trained personnel available to passengers that helps those interested with internet shopping and also with the charge of the bonus purchased on their card,” said the project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the vending machines found in some lobbys of the subway.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker machine and travelers will probably already have set on them at the stations of Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“Now there are in the city five but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty,” Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, in the surrounding trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the central Bohemian localities.
“On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus zone,” explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The surrounding buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bond.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver,” Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on encircling buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bond can address the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudethes called in 1945 for Smoking to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Sudetes Germans were presumably addressed to the U.S. President in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular file and are stored today in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the \"Scimava land\" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
\"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as deliverers\" is written in the letter, signed with a - the people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts -
In view of the fact that the Czechoslovakia union with the southeast Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope alone in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors call on the American President to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
\"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people it gives us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way cooperates with the victory of the Allies\" is written in the letter.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the Czech oppressors.
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some experts, accurately paint the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans should have minimally felt that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Southeast some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed this.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, wrapped up in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British rushed him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
\"They thought that on returning home, the Czech would be good for them,\" said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that under the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay off!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way it could be characterized by the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš Æebíček promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous driving to the steering wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be made on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
I'd have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind you that before you get started, you stick to the belts.
He wants to reach awareness above all of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and lastly also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that ambivalent to emotions.
And to do so we are attested to by the announcements - bloody - throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay off!
The word \"Don't think\" is written with great letters in the license plate.
And in a blood clot is the word \"pays\"
This must symbolize that man at a time of despondency can come to pay with his own life.
The announcements are going to -fear - the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcements have been drawn up by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
For drivers, the system of sugar and whips is valid.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and so saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks, says the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
“If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it,” Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas for peace
The President of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the return of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
\"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all (occupied) lands if not all of them,\" Olmert said to the daily.
\"I'm sure we'll keep a few percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them a percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace,\" he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution Jerusalem would also be included this one.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over their legs as he passed on to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem” said Olmert in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead were killed and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place, which is located inside the ancient city.
He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work - he insisted later on.
Withdrawal of the Golan Talls
Olmert also pronounced for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highs, which in his view is an inherent condition for the closure of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
\"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan,\" he warned.
The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hizbulá (Kite Movement), they must be freed from the ongoing support of Hamas' terrorism (Kite Movement), Al Qaeda (Terrorist Network) and the Yihad (Holy War) in Iraq, the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are saffates illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In relation to the tragic accident of the student agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, we have the question of whether the saffates and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the azafata is opposed to the traffic law,” says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 25-year-old saffata died last week, evidently was caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the right time when the saffote distributes the coffee or newspapers.
What plays the role here is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
The long distance buses from Student Agency have no sites to walk, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
This has been solved by the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom by being on the bus if they have a seat - he told us his position.
Saffata doesn't know the law
\"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of azaphat - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term \"Vehicle Reviewer\", whose rights and obligations are not defined - adds, less bluntly, the Hanzelka spokesperson.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently deals with this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That's all - it says.
The buses are divided among the urban areas, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurbans with standing sites with a higher speed permit and long distances without standing places, with the highest speed permit and seats equipped with a safety belt.
As in the plane, the expert says
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no major problems with the traffic in the bus.
During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Not even here is the certainty that the turbulences will come and that the azaphata can be hit in the head -
\"However, if the bus suddenly slows down, the physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or tram.
The safety of the azafata must solve it the transporter's internal rules - he says and he also thinks that this problem is not being solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the azafatas service.
It employs two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
\"However, at the moment I get the impression that the place of azaphate is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses - it says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks azaphates in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
\"We don't have zaffates, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident - he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has occurred
In the incident of the line joining Naples, a young Pilsen Zaphate died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermitters.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, clashed with the front right side.
Jančura denies that they were sold the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the azafata.
\"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked\"
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the judge on the girl's family's compensation but it also expects the financial costs for the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the saffata on the bus in which for a year they have been working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
\"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not devote themselves to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march, says expert Hořín.
The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Zaphates to be a major threat to passenger safety, ending the Hanzelka spokesperson, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is based in Frankfurt
In the letter from the Board of Directors of West LB Bank for its employees there is no shortage of words.
For the merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as the writing says, published on Monday
Bank West LB, breaking the `competitive block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to be understood when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in times of difficulty.
Because as before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, much has been said about such a bond between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, said he saw no meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or the West LB.
But the board of directors of the DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But lastly Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the elections of the Bavarian parliament are over, the BayernLB union with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack the partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has outgrown much better from the financial crisis that was done by Stuttgart and Munich's real estate.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, there's only the North LB left.
But such geostrategic reflections are only part of it.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a trade model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro- Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the bank's board of directors it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As the coexistence between unique parts of the bank and the DEKA can be matched, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as - the Italian weekend -
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45 there are three buses, `direction Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are planned mostly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to its flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started partying at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
To Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored skates, these buses belong to him.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address \"Brenner\"
No beer, not yet.
Quietness quickly reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the forces.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the 8th road shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written \"Oktoberfest\" next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: \"knowing.it\"
Second: “When the doors of the campaign store are opened, that means marching,” he calls out at dawn.
- March - March and occupy the back sites in the campaign store.
\"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, spread out all over space.\"
One liter of beer, Marco rug, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He just gets out of his place, he'll be busy.
Third: \"This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here,\" you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, to the yellow caps on the trees, signs of traffic and even in a cartel of the elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
He wants to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as - the Italian weekend -
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and tormentively enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross who make a statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 attendances) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The Italian campaign's favorite store is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only last week the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück stepped up.
Well, that the politician would use the word - relatively - and added that the German banking field will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich property finance, which is listed in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to be able to withstand turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters that credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes as from private banks also from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financials with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed only a short period - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the cash bank's capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital has dropped somewhat from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period of last year, the continued revenues of financial investment and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, in 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of reimbursements of the costs of compensation for the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the repayment of interest under the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financial at first was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the real estate, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Airel bank.
As much money could not be earned from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations about the value of the subsidiary that will have a -essential material effect - on the consolidated account of the group's losses and profits, it is said very inaccurately.
It's a fact that's canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial asset in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, proves to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans went down essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank provides credit for the group's funding for a short time and the company is assured of - the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially unfit for operation -
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the president of the Hypo Real Estate Board, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and the bank creditors.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But you can't rule out the opposite.
It was the voice that on the last Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least concerned people.
The stock price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, loan courses according to the position in the property register clearly tend to fall.
The loans of former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are mainly affected, and the loans of which fall to 2009.
After the notable growth in the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that previously were an investment for speculation must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it is possible to depart from the amortisation of pensions in the short term.
Or something is going to happen, which no one is likely to imagine - the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial status, now the security that is already at its limit became a justifiable hope.
That's going to be a reason, because the creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their enthusiasm isolation.
Short-term investors can still put the end-point and use transport to new account of losses for future payment of profit compensation taxes on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally (kawaii)!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the Tokyo border in the direction of Kawasaki and I go on a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, luckily I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my house, in Baja Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Besides, I am not a person who speaks very gladly in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: \"Sayonara Wo she Sylvana\" - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because for two years I had begun to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have knifed, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word \"kawaii\"
I already knew her about my Mangas.
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means -mona, pretty -
Then I quickly undressed in my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone talked at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation they all took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring bits of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu pasta.
In most cases I have no idea what I'm like here in Japan.
Things are rare and taste new.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools the winds are not simply a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a gift made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
\"Why, Japan precisely?\" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year at school.
Then he always answered:
\"Well, because I'm fascinated.\"
Finally, for years I have preferred to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a flak for tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life -
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger escapes, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, acting in the manner similar to us, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called “Edge” for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to test it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about feeling and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: he becomes dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contage our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and in the executive functions they conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from the other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is linked with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it is, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, it is not allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents big problems to us.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consented experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential goes rather to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I do not consider it probable.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can one control if rats and men behave in such a way?
Seeing danger a cockroach escapes, so why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour still does not prove the appearance of experience.
That's true, neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand don't have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to try it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected to be the same as that of rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward that permanent work without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platinum: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister, Iwan Wasjunik, said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine’s capacity to organize the European Championship together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
\"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do -
The time of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is taken.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do great work at great speed - said the president of a Ukraine Grigorij Surkis association.
The UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us.
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules, Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
In a letter we assured the President of UEFA Platinum that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from it.
Only in the last season were many clubs of the first division condemned because of descent manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid’s outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life, and had trouble with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid pair: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan stated for the first time the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after her divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film, The Women, a story about the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is - unheard of that Meg how many times he tells the story of our relationship in another version - the 54-year-old man said to -New York Daily News -
Among other things, it is very, very regrettable, that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again, will remember in public the pain and the changes, all of which means a divorce for a child.
While Ryan after his divorce lives alone, Quaid is newly married and recently a twin pope.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting: “Be as my life goes on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay.
The prices of plane tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany cost up to 50 percent.
Aircraft tickets and overnight stays in hotels have become cheap again - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after rising prices in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half.
After prices on the hotel market have continued to rise for many years, overnight stays on many sites were made cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of the U.S. tourist’s interest in travel being diminished.
The decrease in hotel prices is also made much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed the rise trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the increase in the loose economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane the demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty which liberalises the traffic of aircraft between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that declared in bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still does not go out to make the decimal goal.
Kristoffer Klein very well presented the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
Everything I wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, I could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
\"We need a second goal - sylba Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were again at their sites.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the principal trainer of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
\"Today it wasn't all nice to see,\" added Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wanted to have it - more relaxed -
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
\"That was a dirty victory,\" said Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
The Saturday of will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
\"We know how to interpret it,\" said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quip with its late forced players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the pitcher Petric as well as Jansen who was taken from FC Bayern needs time to get together, but still the chip cannot shine with its successes.
\"We need more than feeling and dribbling,\" Jol demanded.
After the defeat of the vote
The Wall Street spreads fear.
The first news on the failure of the bank bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.

The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called mortgage actions - rotting -
But the sum is going to be paid by stroke but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the stock option receipts for financial associations that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Action courses in Europe and the USA continue to fall
Aids of one billion for banks in Europe and the USA do not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and negatively influences the Dax.

Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be wary: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
The experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe - Ulysses - spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel pipelines are freezing now threatens to die in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational maneuvering assistance, has led to disconcerting among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the path of space probes during which they gain acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example, of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Sun's probe Ulysses did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
They are more often irregular in speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect so far.
He was called anomaly during gravitational maneuvering assistance.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the attractiveness of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study now solemnly believes that before Einstein did not confuse and try to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers left in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists abducted in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention of the kidnappers.
Welt ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
As far as European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are concerned, they are released.
About this the same information presents Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arab television station and the Italian media.
After news on the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the liberation: \"Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your state of health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants in the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the army of the Sudan had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue - the guard said.
It was just about \"receiving hostages\" - when suddenly came - this surprise -
On Sunday the Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have been detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper - El Masri El Jom - referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the rescue.
The men had to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather - led to suicide -
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through a survey, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: \"I feel responsible for her death\"
The court was aware that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After her divorce in 1980, Trerise moved back to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court was aware that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was plagued by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after she had been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed — emotionally dead — as if she had — renounced life —
In April 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying: \"I used to tie her and wink her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for your death.
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she had not done so, the issue would probably not have ended in the courts.
He added: “I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother, abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future -
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two documents highly classified on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a criminal offence.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner referred to the conviction as a surprise to many in the English administration.
\"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet,\" he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley rescue/salvation.
The Government, in effect, provided 14 billion pounds sterling to protect the deposits of 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that the companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the loan of 14 billion should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest arising in the internal market is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
\"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent\"
According to BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
\"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members in the face of what might be a relevant price,\" said Mr Cole.
Interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of due interest, which may be almost twice as many.
Being the mutual construction companies organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably pay the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
The residents of the Jersey strado will have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra fivepence the liter since next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denying the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh on bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in that she may be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various charges of corruption in your charge.
His long-term political rival Khaleda Zia was released on bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, supported militarily, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected the application for bail for Sheikh Hasina claiming that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad under probation,” said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We are going to bring an appeal against the Supreme Court's order.
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, referring to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges charged.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the UN - have been unable to take advantage of a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that it happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials as they carried out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that obliges the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9 per cent in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopolio Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of the administrative staff.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
- Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved, - Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine state lawyers were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the pursuit of Republicans, high profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a \"primary responsibility\" for the dismissals, which he \"abdicated\" of his leadership position and was -notably not collaborative - in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Very Honorful Meat Loaf
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards by its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said that getting this recognition will be an honor.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album that Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is running the awards for this year's awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained in the classifications for about nine years and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Street - before I found the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street more than an active street.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the First Street
who wants to restore Extra Place and create a clean corridor to shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-time neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Land Use Community Committee held this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n.3.
“The city is owner today of very few spaces and we would like it to continue owning Extra Place,” said Mrs.
\"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.\"
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first arose during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of converting it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of that.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that he obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that leaves on the cover of the album Ramones-Rocket to Russia -
“The environment was magnificent,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
\"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes\"
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the Burgundy of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, still modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a strip of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct), has made available part of a city history talk about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow and outless alley, dark also by the day and marked by doors of oxidized iron warehouse and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canyons”
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was curated through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle near 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that you could get cleaned up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
\"I spent the best years of my life,\" he said, \"in dark, wet and disgusting places.\"
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and Director of Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book \"Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice\"
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that - African-Americans and Latin American students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, - and this is a very certain consideration.
In order to combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, “transitional bilingual education” for students-English.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
more than one third of students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost equally amazing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr Obama favoured.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any apology.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to the instruction of English to students is in the - total immersion -
Immersion in English means almost exclusively the use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, \"we have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was.\"
\"It works,\" he said, \"we think it works.\"
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the subject of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, \"you must make sure that your child can speak Spanish\"
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work well, rather than disregard them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The shares of crude oil decreased by 7 percent to 99.80 dollars in the morning negotiation at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before regressing, once again, because of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety took over investors once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was clouded by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachavia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement - they appear to have not been able to revive the feeling of the market -
Since the economic situation is deteriorating, it is expected that the demand for commodities, including oil, will be reduced.
“The prospects for global equity, the interest rate and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is to evaluate whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. —
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast reduction of oil and gas prices is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second room of madness: team sets record
After having spent, during the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a deflate game.
\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Ellis said.
The second room began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with persistence under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came in 10 seconds in half.
\"I didn't get out of my way,\" said Favre of all the steps that were going to Coles.
He's a fucking player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals' defense was mistreating Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The Darrelle Revis cornerback intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, the faults forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a kick of 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: “The second quarter or the third fourth?”
When she was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points with no answer in the third room - Mangini said: -I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time -
Gebselsie rested head of his world record
Again, Haile Gebselassie of Ethiopia has proved because many consider him the greatest runner in history, overcoming his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the accommodating plain race at 2:03:59, Gebselsie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set up a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-rheloj race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution will aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he arranged to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the beginning of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebsselassie won this Sunday, using on average a 4 minute cutlery 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of last Sunday, Gebrselassie told journalists that he had suffered cramps in the pantorilla two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
“I’m very happy,” Gebselsie told the journalists.
- Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end it was all right --
The athlete has been the subject of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemaker as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebresselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pacemakers diminished.
But just before three miles from the target, Gebrselassie took one last impulse to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi came to third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place on 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: -the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison -
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Eatonville Fair to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance of Harlem.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - also making it a tourist stage by including it in Florida's travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season - remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to share their true ideas with the white man, who - he knows so little about us and who doesn't know what's going to be lost -
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
\"We are very cautious about the way our history is told,\" said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and a member of the oldest church in the city.
\"You have to be right\"
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes defunct, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and secretive.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialected books such as \"Mules and Men\" (1935) and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
With a face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
\"Out of the road to the left,\" he wrote, \"there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write\"
She also mentions the widow's new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee - sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms -
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston puts in relation to Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
\"Zora described it as it was,\" said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who was immortalizing Mrs. Hurston by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: \"Some people didn't like that.\"
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as an eccentric vivacious who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without prior notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically.
\"People were always very happy to see Zora,\" said Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, \"she never stayed too long\"
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where it had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, nor large public readings.
\"I don't think your contribution to the world or your inheritance was understood,\" said Valerie Boyd, author of \"Wrapped in Rainbows,\" a biography by Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The officials of Orange County wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-way street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
\"During that season, a group of white boys went through the city throwing oranges and every thing against the people who were sitting next door,\" said Mr. Franklin.
They killed a girl once, too.
They threw him against a car-sandy.
In a letter of 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education - was insulting rather than honoring my race -
R Residents today say that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
\"I wasn't hugging your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there,\" said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, as she did, with boyanto, trust and lines like: \"How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand.
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went all the way to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemingway appeared in the bookstores, reintroduced in the American canons.
The road project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The idea raised from the road to five tracks would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply: \"Zora saved Eatonville\"
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church from here in 1993, began showing up in big numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library ( bearing the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a reselling and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community might be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly.
\"Most people, in case they dare go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,' says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
\"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at her story, it's a very nice city\"
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the hurricane's eye.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nest offices that are above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers that monopolize New York face each day the worst - bad day of the office - since the 1929 bass.
Guys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of apartment cargoes, like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric print hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their morning food, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait to queue for their bagel to the salesmen's carts, and however it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic predictions there are, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon in my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where clients all their life order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my, my trusted banker, and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks in places where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction society), from the credit unions and from the savings banks of their home city whose whites only work within the state of belonging, and they say treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office workers and shops that stood before me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe shelter, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-one and something to fix in my apartment block uniform, has changed the normal course of our conversation about Brad and Angelina or my shopping in the tent.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that - now I have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks -
Desecrated Muslim Tombs at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for freedom of Austria and Belgian Philip Dewinter, a member of the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization - Cities Against Islamization - in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the far-right political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, where the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the tombs, but the researchers think that this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said that they were \"deeply shocked\" by the news of the desecration, which came to the Muslim religious when Ramadan month was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection then the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that fell almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headpans and the burkas, and also expressed opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a \"European brotherhood\" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police made a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's earlier convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: “On Thursday, 25 September, at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad like France and Spain until 25 March.
\"Paul Gadd did not attend in person\"
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of the registration of sexual offenders.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A police spokesman from Kent said: “Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police spokesman from Kent said: “Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to keep an eye on someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
\"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public.\"
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court in western London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacquei Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that they had forbidden Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
‘Capto al maestro off-stage to extract its character — Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere costumes.
The essence of the great flamenco teachers, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
The other person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at those moments outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, unconcerned because you are not going to go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in \"Flamenco-people\" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with that least known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition - it reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day - explains the creator, who clarifies that -Flamenco-people - -can be any person but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed on the street are artists capable of transmitting in the scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco-
With the taste of the festival - Singe de las Minas - Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of camera and material remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, conferring modernity on it, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: -A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day -
It is not the action of the dance, of the singing or of the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the embodiment that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Known figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with \"Portartproject\" portraits of veteran sportsmen.
Although the concepts are different in -Flamenco-people - the photographer admits that - I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in your life, whether it's a long or short moment.
I think within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You either meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't know, or they leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled \"Flamenco-people\", is shown in the El Fotómata Gallery, located in the number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is - a fear -
It is set in places that do not yet know and discuss unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to taking forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him - it is a fear - and that - all indicates that he should not write - the novel.
\"If it were sensible, I would not, but I will do it and I hope to finish it once,\" he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of “The city and the dogs” was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of \"Our mutual friend\" by Dickens - filled the opening of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to whom he was made very short the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in his literary vocation, derived from the \"extredinary adventure\" of the \"placer of reading\" and \"living more than he lived - how he writes of \"disciplined woman - to supplicate his \"lack of inspiration\" - with an intense work of documentation, correcting and re-doing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what - immaterials of memory - are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that there is no way to measure and know if books change life, but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience, he underlined Vargas Llosa, who said that it - has effects - and - makes people more uncomfortable - so he asked the writers - not to give up on frivolity, and - take responsibility for their vocation.
The climateology dims the Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of areas
The celebration of areas closing the season of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced players that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather inclemences have blighted with this fair, as at last two of its three festivities have not been celebrated.
On Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a siege of Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a party.
In it, the triumpher was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went to his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sallied his two astutes with greetings and an ear, which granted the tender ones more than his bullock.
That is, even worse was El Juli, who went through the Llanos cosmos without grief or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief fair, he won the joke of a large part of the audience.

Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers chased and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A. J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of a public document.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, rushed sharply and broke control.
The officers started their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the archen, when their two occupants crashed into the race for a forest area.
The Ertzains finally reached out to one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hachish burden, so they moved to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been - doubled - since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrest of a criminal offence of forgery of a public document has also been charged.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the detention of the other suspect, who managed to flee to the career as has been said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was transferred to police units to carry out the related investigations and will be available for trial within the next few hours.
Detained actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers by trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, as the magazine People revealed a spokesperson for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear - he was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and going backwards passed several times over his sunglasses -
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because - she was worried about Locklear's life -
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
It seemed disoriented, so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to run a test for her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed co-operative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the very start, although, according to the first sights of the officers, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication -
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison for around 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The General Coordinator of IU and Member of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional training federation that will have to make a decision on the case of former Council of Youth and Sports of Seville City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing family-friendly treatment.
“I am a federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers,” Llamazares said about the action that the party will have to take with it so far in the Seville Consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for transparency to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always argued that such matters are of the highest degree of transparency”
In the same vein, he stressed that training has - strict ethical codes for all public positions -
'Sangre de May', the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried - to illustrate the multitude of characters and the social analysis - which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, is introduced this Friday in the cinemas, to become the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures he has fulfilled with this shooting - a dream of childhood - that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to cast a memorial tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Madrid Community has contributed in its entirety is a unique opportunity for Garci to set up with the decorators and the appropriate clothing the portrait of an atolled Spain that was wrong as head for which to fight, as the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII, has pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding such as that of Alatriste or Goya's ghosts - more than twice that of Sangore in May - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes shaped in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Return to begin with, has focused on what is his usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who do not cast, as it seems - humble - and consider that - part of the director's office resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry he works in -
Many of the interpreters who coincide in Sangre de May repeat before their camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood itself of May, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, - which must be made known - has ensured.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect prizes.
\"At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you are satisfied with making one more movie,\" explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will honor a Sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when he was three years old moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corsé that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of interwars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
\"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed amazing to me.\"
According to the dancer, we do not intend to tell his life but to gather his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, the butterfly dance suggested to me a guajira, or the snake dance, some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic - he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in her performances, as he did in the \"The Open Door\" and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
\"Mattilde makes Tortola bigger, the character of maturity.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it.
The montage also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the eternal companion of these type of artists who were divas in their entirety, and who are always in love with them -
The work also recounts in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she was habitually living in London.
\"I wanted to remind you because I think it's from those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now nobody knows and much less value their work,\" says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. in the Lope Theatre of Vega.
The publication of the \"Diary of a newly married poet\" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the \"Diario de un Poete Reciencado\" in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the \"Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón\" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the \"Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón\" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition \"Juan Ramón Jiménez: That cup of light\" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, will be planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Council of the Andalucia Board has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the Diario de un Poet Recipeciado - edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
- Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them -
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in \"Ausence of malice\" and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and of all America, to the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
Look what it cost them to give you an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
It's still been a mess for everyone.
\"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,\" cried Robert Redford, \"my life and my country were better thanks to its existence\"
No one was afraid of doing the ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark moment, fearful of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for soils, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an ideal almost platonic of beauty and real.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first-born dead from overdose to his home and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost much to overcome a suicidal eating culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood's barry admiration without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he had not killed a man but an era.
Another Englishman, director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no less than the top of his career.
Australia's bad boy, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
\"He has left us the very high list for all,\" noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
She got divorced once but then she was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom she was faithful when she was probably left with opportunities not to be.
\"But for what I'm going to eat burgers outside the house, if I have steak inside, I used to joke himself.
In heaven, he is proud that his daughters will match their fans on earth, something not so common in America.
\"Of all the great roles he interpreted, of no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, sociable grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,\" they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are celebrated in Madrid and, after the failure 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst career I've ever been in.
A full of disproposals which, of course, if taken into account as an assessment and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The waste starts with the collection of the backend, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the backend (first deproposal, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the T-shirt (second deproposal, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or has the crisis decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a minucia compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and also you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting period of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by popular rebellion conatos and assault on the hut.
I think that about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn't score the exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, it wouldn't go into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, it has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) meeting what it listens to in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this \"receptionist\" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversational groups.
In the video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that he is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells him she'll be there soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week it has been talked a lot over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essential rather than loaded with commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a find taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and -extracts - to Windows.
The change of course is grateful.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome came out on the net, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer for the Hardware and Software to understand.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the \"death\" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and each day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications coming in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post took you in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond early in the month.
In the refreshment machine, a poster asks you to use your search tool - -Your search. Our future -
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by pulling 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lucied one in Edward Zwick's 'Diaman of blood', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the gay frasculated parish.
And if we get to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp moustache force that raised weights in a traveling circus.
Essentially, it is only the typical male underwear shirt in cotton, girded and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which call the speaking angles, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles gives out on all the others.
First of all, because of its striking name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' highlights the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry in detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine T-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Wears designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
\"I want to be young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me.\"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than pretty and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house esponsorizes.
Warm and shy, wins in the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have devised my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the opera dinner in Valentino honor.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movie of the 1950s and 60s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very polyphastic woman, aren't you?
I think so, but, in the end, everything is united and they have a lot of ties in common.
I liked my clothes from childhood; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to scream in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers like to make us our stylisms for classes and rehearsals, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the act of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You met not long ago 30, did you come in crisis?
What's up.
I feel better than ever, the 30 of me like it.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she asks me for it and, besides, I want to be a young mom; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give my son much happiness and educate him with great love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for several premieres you played last year.
That's right and I'm looking forward to them seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, can't be.
I'm looking for 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the tomb of Christ'.
See what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a gateway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to a gateway to model.
I simply called myself Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite myself to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we exhibit - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part that she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pine, then so did he.
To benefit women in the third world, whatever is needed.
Reoccurring drivers by alcoholemia must install the 'alcolack'
Inside wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the hybrid vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project with a duration of one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so it will also receive a course of road reeducation.
In the experience, in addition to the Office of the Attorney-General for Vial Security, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 per cent of the car drivers reported more than once for driving drunks return to pick up the car.
Alcolock would prevent it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air spiraling and prevents the car from booting if the driver does not blow abs; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would be on behalf of the sanctionee.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce to 65% the breaches during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure deals with administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviour before it leads to criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and yet the necessary reform by the criminal system requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote for an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time of the program, landed in the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use their hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
On foot of stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who play the rescue of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps had informed her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give the photographers a smile and a escort stop before they move to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a reporter from the Mexican television station is waiting for them.
The award best equipped with fashion
Possibly there is no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion award, than Paris and possibly no living designer more exquisite and bont alive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Spoto-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is gifted with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's scape in number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the signature in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the juror of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the closest of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was lucid even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken with grief and making his heart tripes, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH props, which cut off the breath, and his son Luis' arm - a canyon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and he is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of own design - and for dinner was transformed with a long-time black sexy dress, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'grand fold' mite.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but he first taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, this is life.
1001, the number anti-stress
There is not 1000 but 1,000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And on its own little, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on 30 September.
The alarmer almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine getting involved in the agitated pace that imposes the current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together on the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores in the hands of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' disintegrates such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Sleepy talk
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very scared by telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk are asleep.
The first time you're at best scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign disturbance of sleep that is called somnoloquios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told him he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear in a very sporadic way (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in monthsS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its occurrence.
They often relate to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (sleeping flooring) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they may also be associated with very high fever frames, stress or overexcitation situations.
However, it is a phenomenon that has not been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a tone of quiet voice, loose words, a murmur or anything else (screams, tires, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is causing much anxiety and gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another alteration of the sleep that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress frame).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get too excited about the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or TV series that are scary or a bit violent.
With very nervous children who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer dream.
Once the somnoloquias appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should check out or find out what it is that generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not fall into the temptation to ask him a question to sound information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Moreover you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which much care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
I'm not even kidding.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal occasions and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rock the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern almost went to take the \"power\" and by turn Fonderflick from far away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
On the front, we wouldn't let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in the attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to pick up the balloon rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousien taster will not be able to taste his happiness much longer and will be forced to return in the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousians who have gone back a little to - compress - their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major butterfly, the ball passed very close to the cross-cutting field.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a ride for Britain.
In the face of the manifestation of resistance by fishermen who strongly disrupted the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him, in a constructive spirit, and hope that he will come with concrete proposals.
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the — crisis committee — created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in gas oil prices, which marks a record by reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president - will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors -.
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm footing.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in almost 10 km of jams.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ile have not been stopped.
A filter barrier has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the oxen stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important refinery Total of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the crisis committee will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support its movement.
The strike will continue - because - the fishermen did not abandon - and - do not want to move to Paris -, for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that a boat's financial balance point can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of - Two men and a fate - has died from cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivery equipment, reaffirmed the president of Embraer, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies a lot on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which has been taken out of trouble by the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the edition of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, it needs this newspaper.
The board of directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from part of AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in the private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic Paris Stock Exchange session
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a loss never seen in the stock exchange of almost 800 points, and Nasdaq a 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365,45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684,81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, i.e. the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, returned 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed a bit of stability to be recovered in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
This is not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan, said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
- This shows how far the market had this plan, - Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days will come - too late -
If the project is really moribundo (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American Central Bank, the Network's N.) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions more,” said Brian Bethune, Chief of Economy and Finance of the Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, - every day that passes, the fall of a financial institution - in the United States, underlined Mrs Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, leading to emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face - not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis - added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The 10-year bond yield dropped by 3,632 %, against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161 %, against 4,357 % on Thursday.
Obama, winner during the first television duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that has been followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's, although honorable, provision was not - quite - brilliant - to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published last Saturday, gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good expected performance of his candidacy member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He's got good instincts, but I'm preventing Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, stressing his opponent's \"ingenuity\" on these issues that were at the heart of this first career.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that he's accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without being confused, he showed himself concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so - he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, before 20,000 people who had met for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not pronounce the words - middle class - or - workers - - Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
Next week it could be a decisive episode - it was estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's good economic instincts with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster - the final result of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain - is eight years.
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless come to reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of Americans despite the shocks of Wall Street, Senator Illinois also pointed out that the realization of a possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 nuclear power plant park here by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates avoided the issues pertaining to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?
Youth and opponents manifested last Sunday in the afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
Some hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in the Minsk central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: \"The dictator has to resign.\"
Some recognize that they have not voted: - for what, because they will do what they want with my vote - says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has done good to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered as clean for observers.
They didn't go according to the opposition.
We have been put on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count of the votes, and Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of the Democratic Forces, was sorry to have a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
It is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some opposition Members enter the parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
But your entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and proposals for law.
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because - the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It underlines that participation figures appear to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
- Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, those who are better suited to power. —
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Sangre becomes safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has again become one of the safest and most effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had been seriously wavered by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, some provinces then created a committee that aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau committee accomplished this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gelineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, he recalls Descary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence - it says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population in Quebec had the successive confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, remembers that confidence is extremely fragile.
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the disease of the crazy cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Count Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gelineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we set out exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. —
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: Nucleus acid tests that enable the blood of donors to detect the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, which were based on the tests used so far.
Nucleid acid tests made it possible to shorten the period between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period within a period of less than one week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS for a blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I think it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without any worries, says the head of Hema-Québec's management.
Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, for example, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant - Dr. Décary goes on to point out that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since more aggressive anticancer treatments, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
Ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that regroups on average only 3% of Quebecs eligible for blood donation.
All people with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 % of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all, to retain and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate his blood - Francine Décary is afflicted.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered to be biomedical wastes is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and are expected to take out more than a thousand of these each year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year - Dr. Décary describes this blood-taking program as very popular.
Many mothers are disappointed to be unable to enjoy this, since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) at the shore of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time on any side, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only one who threw Matt Jordan out of the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game in the series of games to go and return, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a defeat by 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps accessed however in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Coming soon - The victorious goal of Kovalev
The threesome number one of the Canadian is willing to start the season.
Alex Kovalev's composite unit, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the 3-2 Canadian win attack on the free barrier fire in front of the Florida Panthers last night in the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this gain, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
- I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.
He tried to play maximum in the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.
Charest takes care of North
The Prime Minister is not excluded from launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get himself elected during today's partial election.
To reject the limits of our last major northern border: such is the long-term ambition Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining on the major lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydro-electric embalming, mining, of Quebec seen by -Google Maps - maps, etc.
Great means as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he pointed out that his schedule was very full.
The North Plan is the fourth side of a vision, which the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a new economic space, which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister explained, however, why the North was a jewel of immense potential, but it did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains - nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond - according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This - territory twice as big as France -, - is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us - he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, underlined: the gilead towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James Bay.
\"It belongs to us, it is our future,\" he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister specified during the press conference.
It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government - he indicated.
In addition, - with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North - he spoke of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would pay close attention to them and that the project would benefit young people, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly MP of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations around thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a meeting in which a common vision will be given.
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan - will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly - promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently about transforming the challenges into new times of growth and development.
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-bautize Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future, said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, this conservative, John Diefenbaker's Roads to the North program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment is scheduled for 2012.
“This remains between us, but I plan to be there,” he confided to his militants, cheering applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
It underlines that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly - constitutional aspirations - that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec specifically calls for recognition of Quebec's specificity in the Constitution.
She also wished Quebec to name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the main lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The leader of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, - we would have made progress today - said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (votion that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
“But what you want is that this isn’t just a show,” said the leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Lyrics - A Dishonest Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Harper's cabinet, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a \"reverent\" for Canada.
Dishonoring this woman who has led an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves our full admiration for what she says all about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are criminalized to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only one who mocks with false justice to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, particularly, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little does it care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still don't realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our democracy, that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government wants until now minority (what will happen after October 14th ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounces what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a transparent public debate.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to hurt anyone who dares to hold a stand contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the nearly bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the mining woman to open her books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to not rely on public opinion and rejects requests and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a public debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to designate only heavily paid lawyers and not all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it mostly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as persecution-bite (following the public debate), Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada, urging them not to use this word any more).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a transparent and public debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to reply.
The university world, which we belong to, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unrelenting persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to place devices that limit this type of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has struck Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: better control by those elected for their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses embroiled in the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the companies rescued.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,\" said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” the Democrat explained.
It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of Americans will be huge, said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the investors' mood.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who had joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, not to mention, however, expressing their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama was granted certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that which would allow the owners to retain their home and the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the State.
When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, they should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary - he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: - I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it. -
The important points I have read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option to do nothing is not acceptable.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the doubtful debts, the assets at risk and invincible of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (CPA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of the deadlock since the Democrats accepted that certain - toxic - assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of closing the waits for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in rescue companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures relating to housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and metal compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, told his constituents that, with all the evidence, Washington does not want to understand.
We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But it's not about taking advantage of taxpayers.
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us: we asked Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said yesterday.
Right now, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group by 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that he had given up buying his competitor in bankruptcy since he lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
This is not lost money, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos declared yesterday.
Instead, we recovered a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the savers and the families now appreciate that the times are uncertain.\"
During this time, on the other side of the Left, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an compromised icon
His blue eyes represented for so long his triumph.
The American actor with a charming smile had been released from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident would also have turned him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great deep corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, because of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the past few years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who looked a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born of these European roots.
No half ego, last quality brand.
Because he designed a whole country in love with the self made hand, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the motor pilot who was ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the world scandals of the show we do not know very well.
He is an honored man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death provoked the vertigo of the filmmakers this weekend, while his big papers were interwoven on the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual change parade through it.
Many memories return to memory as the cute cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams's adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked your sensible Mr Bridge, troubled by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to the cinema story.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, an offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable at Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked for hatred), by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar at the best film in 1973.
A bitter and avenger billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he earned in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
He's still here.
Seasons change during his career.
Young people know him mainly thanks to Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on unorthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as a godfather of the Irish Mafia on Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the rhizo was curly.
Contrary to several film legends that soon abandoned the career, Newman remained much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fascism and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humor, - as a challenge living in - underplaying - and who judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he interpreted less often the role of young gallan than of marginality: neurotic, alcoholic, clumsy or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed to the sides his true psychic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose devoted his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of smell and sadness.
Among the numerous tributes that were made yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, greatly saddened: - my life and my country were better thanks to their existence -
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, he also hides a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against the excesses of Hollywood.
We have seen his face reign over the vinaagret sauce boats, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although he started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Foundation for Childhood in difficulty.
Newman, rather than be content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these phrases: - always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen is summed up.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
Politicians and their accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and organized in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the funds obtained in public contests were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the municipalities - in their entirety some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fairal Baloldal organization and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public contests with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the charge, most of the invoices were false.
To this end they obtained the Talonaires in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunulas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour by the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Sides.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption, and these served as a model for the invoices he presented, among others, in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András þri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his study trips - Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomy center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a guest in Badacsonytomaj town had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill contained hundreds and thirty people.
But the highly fancied invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomy center. Because in the possession of books thereof - according to the information given to the Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he already knew that it was fake documents.
\"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place\"
He added: in addition to formal problems, he did not agree that a hundred people were housed according to the invoice, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not fit.
In addition, meals were also included on the invoice, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest exclusively organises trips abroad, so that in the cash bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
Furthermore, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the (consignors) also made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not perform the company founded as an investment consultant.
Equally for formal differences - improper format of the invoice, false stamp - it was assumed that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturalis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehérto Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers did not pay any attention to the fact that when the Fial Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The invoices were sent out consciously
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvany , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredert.
To the manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the charge - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, as later they cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the suitor of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data these invoices were purchased by the Kft. Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunalas, which since 14 September 2005 has been under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should also have dispatched the company related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued to the company invoices for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvany by charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at Iván Kubatov's express request.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the defendant, they did not receive work.
But it profited from these companies, as at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave in total 15 invoices to different entities worth 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecution considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the company in Szi-Beri to issue fictitious bills used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generació and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The competition obtained 500 000 HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
For this not to be discovered, they presented to TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Office - the course of counterfeiting the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the head defendant János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is, what interest does he have in doing it?, perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could be offended, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the many perpetrators of very higher economic crimes, who have never returned the money, walk freely or at least can expect the sentence in their own home, he does not have a chance for that.
Psychology of overlapping: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overestimate the product.
New York University neurologists and economists discovered the neurological - economical bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in skills such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this game by experimental auctions.
One volunteer group played lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self prize of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in betting is explained as a prevention not to cause an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups fought against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 prior to the auction, but in case the auction was lost, the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group that played - against failure - were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the group - the winner -
These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation - Andrew Schotter, professor of the economics faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are propagated by two main forms: hepatitis A and E through food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperma, vaginal mood, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be protected by A and B vaccines, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it manifests through a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year a million people die worldwide in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected patients receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooers.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control too, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered on time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviates the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
The Oxford University scientists conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - the British Telegraph reported.
Within the framework of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists applied electric shock, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they set a sparking instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the 17th century work of Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Army of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of religious theme or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt in security, as individuals, protected, calmed and peace reigned in their hearts.
As they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt about 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such striking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, only the proper image must be found.
\"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as by a mother or a father,\" said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would the regulation of pain have if the faithful were shown to the Madonna de Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
At its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it in the people's pocket, as well as in the sky above your head; you know where your holidays were spent, what doctors visit and what is it that interests you.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, the skeptics that make a parallel with the orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times newspaper that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in a system all the information in the world.”
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world is still in the early stage of the effort to be able to deal with all the information.
To the question that is what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered this way: I wish Google could answer questions such as \"What to do tomorrow\" or \"What would be the best work for me\" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions apparently as simple as there is not enough information from the users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their navigation on the Network the search keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they went when they finished the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, which they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by watching Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be feared and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only do they preserve, but in justifiable cases they also yield to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May, were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, by any of the points of the constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to secure its pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to Google’s view: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life, starting to use Google’s services, and rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries see in them the future generation, the \"vant-garde incorporation\" not so to their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by their Windows as conqueror of the World, much as they both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks younger, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because the geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that has occurred precisely because of one of the key words most mentioned in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these differ individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the latest photo galleries stored automatically appear in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of which it appears that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the following morning of the common friends, she finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company's management: one thing is safe, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
The life - on line - of a person is what it shows itself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least intends to do away with Google's monopoly, can do so (e.g. by starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave footprints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google’s “on line” applications, from text editing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions that do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible on us.
Public opinion almost openly hopes that the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($14 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are being introduced are increasingly causing severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
The critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions also: for example the top management strongly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's child care, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google yielded to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered any information that would violate the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to function, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next few months and years will be able to turn to the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of Google books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its health system, because in it we can create our own full health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scrogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to delete the marks on the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors on the double murder of Ózd who, according to the reasoned suspicion, helped to delete the prints of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesperson of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod province.
The young people recognized the crime they were accused of, and are currently accused of the crime.
The two minors - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - can defend themselves at liberty.
For the complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man had prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon hidden previously in the crime scene.
The police analyse with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for a hundred percent of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State who in a few months wishes to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic journal E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that among the interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
The experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitlna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the European press's point of view
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever-increasing international financial crisis speak of an 11th of September -
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. President - opinion La República de Roma - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new \"Pearl Habor\" that multi-million-dollar investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it is more correct to speak of a \"second 11 September\"
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led to the world economy on the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will eventually affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress's vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
You cannot ignore this threat - it points out the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at the buffering financial institutions, thus saving them from breaking down with taxpayers' money.
But if, as the dominoes, more bank is demolished, then it will no longer be enough and the new funds, nor the new improvisations.
The long-term need for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than 100 billion euros - remembers the Venetian Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers should also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis that is going on as a cuname for the Old Continent .
The (salvators) will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater harm?
Intelligent auto mimics the flight of beejorro
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of obstacles existing in nature?
For example, beekeeping.
In an amazing project presented at the CATEEC of Japan, the beekeepers gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic direction system of cars type BR23C imitater of nature, to which they gave the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each beejorro creates its own particular oval space that actually looks much like our protective safety capsule - he explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the eyes made up of bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle which immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the bees, changes the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system at present, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
\"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,\" explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Laboratory of Mobility and the robot vehicle project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be done in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike bees, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turning wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bees to dodge other bees, here they only used the rotary motion for the auto robot and acceleration in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is greater, meaning they have longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memories of gigabytes, no megabytes are needed.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, in ten years' time can be incorporated into serial-made models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the existing obstacles on his way.
He's got a name for this very dear boy.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared, which will be applied at various stages in order to purchase bad loans from banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, stating that the agreement is only to be formalized in a document.
The commitment to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, spoke about the outcome of the commitment, said: this program will work and it will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving the Wall Street, but about turning it back into the economic car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington's schedule (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called the Emergency Act for Economic Stabilization of 2008, Monday will first vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are happy with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion on buying bad quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit, bad rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other-poisonous-type credits, as well.
The purchase can be made on auctions or in direct form - competent persons of the ministry reported.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in a insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or risk prevention that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks in trouble and waiting for State aid may rely on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations also depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank is judged.
By buying the bad credits directly the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that boss' compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the income of the directors general - said the measure the Democrat Barney Frank, president of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from participating banks in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to gain profit from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the President shall submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens have ordered us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayers' dollars - said Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year you won't need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago, before Hungarians living there.
In his opinion - practically everything depends on the time building on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control -
At the same time he warned that the new system will remove the entry premise, but tourists must register before they leave the country of origin.
From today the head of Hungarian diplomacy maintains talks in Washington.
He will meet with the State Secretary Condoleezza Rice by handing him the Middle Cross with the Order of Merit Star of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the financial rescue package from banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties secured on Sunday their support for the administration's 700 million-dollar banking aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of negotiations of a marathon type, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, by putting economic issues first, Obama gained some advantage again and the advantage of McCain that he had obtained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice president disappeared.
In a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He pointed out that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
“We need to act now and with responsibility (...) it is in danger of employment, of saving you. Moreover, entire industries and the stability of the whole economy,” he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take the opportunity to qualify McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to the ABC McCain, he explained that we will all bring this to a very hard time (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a commission of control to the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he was the one who insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press journal of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group themselves became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in his article entitled \"The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents,\" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, also of Angela Merkel.
Failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but a process was completed on Sunday that had been planned for almost ten years now: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities, and this also has political implications.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group became the most conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones that have gone beyond the CSU; the autonomous, the small industrialists, those with bachelor's degree and those with graduates.
Thus, support for CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: \"Who with? In its article entitled \"The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues - deal with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the greens on the other hand do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolved around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let out some of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left aside the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, in the post of Vice Chancellor.
He claimed that in any event they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Manyer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation would probably not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must no doubt be discussed within ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
\"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government,\" Haider said.
Jaróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and its host is France, which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing interests of Roma children.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies remain outside the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
\"Most Roma youth have not completed middle education and due to poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university degree\"
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a crucial role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in early Roma children's education can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, there is a need for a broad understanding of these issues between both the Roma and non-Gypsies.
As early as school starts a Gypsy student, more possibilities will be made to become an active member of the labour market; through taxes to income and consumption they will also contribute to the national budget.
“The Roma, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of secondary and low-level education,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the objective and active unity of the European Union is needed to speed up the process of school disengagement immediately, so it is vital that the correct implementation of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is necessary.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be offered the possibility that the democratic space will guarantee that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights,” Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since the Berlin meeting of last year in the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their positions, but it is not known until grace lasts.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-critical duo let themselves inquisitive: they do not cling so much to their posts.
They intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who, one day after the \"tsunami Bavaria\", demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was on the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 percent, in contrast now, a year after the hit at Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had (monopoly) in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to co-operate with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and with the Right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the parliament, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the coup duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly deleted from the stage to the ambitious local policy.
CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will be given an active role Stoiber also that until now he was moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president qualified on September 28 as the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 elections of the Bundestag, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a pivotal role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could hide his disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition members in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, on the other hand by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million people, consisting of a hundred and ten Members, has no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the U.S. Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time - would allow - the entry of some members of the opposition into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott he originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which took credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not give it entry permit to Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered antidemocratic.
It was a sign of disbandment when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena rather than errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the primary report of the OSCE Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
In the view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Georgia Abkhazia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that -the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even one opposition into that unweighted parliament -
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, rather it tries to get the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in the face of its distribution, but even so I see that it is increasingly the ones that support the change among older people as well - Milinkevich said, referring to that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even those who are retired, those who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the breakdown of social security that, it seems to be the silence of the cemeteries, said Milinkevich.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People do not believe in words but in facts” so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: “From now on, she gets to breakfast before starting work”
It has never happened in the History of the Chigi Palace that set automatic doors to control the entrance and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against the person who files and then goes to the bar to have a coffee in working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
‘The automatic doors’ says Brunetta - they are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services - the minister needs.
A new phase of responsibility and transparency is now opened.
This is Reformism - it underlines again Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi - the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view -
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the secretary-general says: \"It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of the employees\"
In short, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and medium moons.
Brunetta's Word, which suggests, smiling, - a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand -
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that in three months the absences for diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50 per cent, that is 60,000 more people at work in one year -
It adds that more effective delivery is needed by the Public Administration
Italy, which are wage dynamics, explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate -
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the Codacons-backed petition.
\"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism of work due to causes of illness\" writes the association of consumers, the people of the 'wander workers' are constantly increasing.
It is actually millions in Italy that employees of the correct and productive public administration have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree -
In particular, in the Tar there will be a response to the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by sickness due because of service; the extension of the hourly rates in which the medical check-in visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: -Cross prevention -
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths in respect of homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, the Anmil is celebrating the 58th national day in all the provinces of Italy for the victims of accidents of work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
\"The worrying data published by Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,\" said President Giorgio Napolitano of the Republic, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalidated by the work, Pietro Merandelli.
The head of State expresses his \"great appreciation for the continuing commitment to prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion\"
\"It has been manifested, a 'lot', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of the public, instead the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics\"
Napolitano does not hide that there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the numerous initiatives promoted at school for more direct awareness of the young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed - as the phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which offends the awareness of each of us and imposes a determined commitment on all institutions to put an urgent end -
The data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is equally impressive - the president of Anmil Pietro Merandelli noted.
\"We do not want this - the tendency to decrease - to be less attentive, because it is precisely when attention is diminished that exploits the tragedy.
We believe that at the general level there is still too little done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our view - it has highlighted Merandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world -.
\"It serves a further effort - it has added - because it concerns communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency -
Merendelli has denounced - the progressive deterioration of the expected level of subsidiary protection for the victims of work - and the -careful conversion to which the system is heading in recent years -
\"The aim is to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he has added - because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time\"
Mp3 readers under charge, risk hearing
Listening to high-volume music over a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement in Brussels quoted the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and newly-identified Health Risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
\"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical apparatus weekly for more than one hour a day with the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity\"
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at a high acoustic level can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
\"From scientific evidence\" follows EU responsibility, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must also review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology.
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical apparatus and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that it caused.
-Scientists conclude that the EU executive confirms that it is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical apparatus and related apparatus.
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical apparatus to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
Such damage can be greatly limited by using solutions such as reduced levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical apparatus listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the way for the future of capital
Today, in March, the accounts will be held in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the Commission for the fututo of the capital of Rome, which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission would discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the municipal council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the \"official ball\" of the Municipality and its commander Gianni Alemanno.
The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to emphasize German - it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council will be able to evaluate themselves later.
There is no remaining position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March the work will end, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - he announced - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome -
He who accuses the Commission of useless, since its opinions are not binding, German replies: “All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested back and forth.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, seriously working towards the development of Rome and its future -
The principal of Rome also tends to point out that this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that express the capital.
For German, in fact, - we need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future -
A future that, the principal of Rome needs, was not limited only to the current communal borders but had looked beyond it - not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but also - considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean -
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him passing independently: \"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he does today by private citizen) with the enemy Islam -
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
She wrote a woman from Miami on a Web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he had won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators.
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voter's question: will it be a good president? And there are the polls; they all say that Obama won and with a good advantage.
In this case too, there is one who talks to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper of the Misisipi, in the interiors of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know who will vote the American patriot.
It leaves one side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
\"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain\"
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the back.
In Iraq it is 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Those who will take up the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, \"sassin\" of the printed paper.
Fifteen American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
But today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper are a major problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not expected to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the \"sassin\" of the printed letter.
The \"economic pressure\" that journalists warn has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that they will do something good through journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between the editors, or directors, and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with the -- job security --
The executives who plan to lose their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff, it's 30%.
The \"safe job\" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation such as the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of - take it or leave it.
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third year to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are \"hell\" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, COPPOLA DANILA IF RELEASE IN GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the field of anti-compromise investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained home release, turning it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the city route of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Endangered elites
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to -the Washingtons' and the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and South states.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of the one who spoke at first.
This barely cited is just one example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to function as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and emerge in the light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which, if they have strong financial relations with the outside, but above all are much more compromised the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state.
What creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has little to say: the crucial test is that the European Union is divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the grant of funds: from the moment it reaches the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values under certain circumstances in which no market likely and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the ever more sophisticated technology network, the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already meant to dominate the world, we realized that our future will in turn have to make the accounts more and more with the unmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, if you look at, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is a sovereign, he certainly has many more letters about who is not, and who is unhappy to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novelty that but I'm pressing a fracture.
Those who say Territorial, State, Government, inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of an inadequately highlighted economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understandable exception of the term, to have made the time itself and to be more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, subterraneanally fuels a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an \"revolved\" election or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stirs in dismeasurement.
In the face of all this, it is frankly exaggerated today about a ‘mass rebellion’.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls as the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilos over a vertical wall.
STUDY - The American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
\"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti\" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the paws of gecos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful of the legs of this reptile and at the same time - easily take off the walls» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Engineering faculty.
- \"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive\" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a microfibre adhesive made of hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmacos: never with fruit juice
Attention to the apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaryly with some drugs changes their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh ones associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of apple juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
FARMACOS A RIESGOS - The same Italian drug agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago, alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drank in case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being taken.
NOT ONLY POMELO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: -These discoveries are generally pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly» the expert of the agency Ansa underlined.
The New Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's administration's decisions on economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack on Enron, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now been proved accurate.
\"I am surprised and a little upset at how the recollection of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom quickly disappeared from the public's attention,\" Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a \"high-value economist\", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism\".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the \"anti-Microsoft\" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by the volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several developments: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse magazine interface, others are added more consistent, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2,the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to the multifunction with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create documents - hybrid PDFs - that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word maker.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the commentary for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to carry some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The version in Italian can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that had been in the mirror since Friday.
Besides that for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent at home or to work.
And if the free issue can be a hook for home dissemination, it is in business that Open Office the suite proves, it tries the big bet, and it can already count on several projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the base date; and lastly Draw the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached nearly 3 million 600 thousand to date, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best climber row.
Giving the news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl blood champions is among those performed in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third post at the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has reported the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been on the podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, adjudicating the row of the best climber.
INMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy of emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants - hosted with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed in Milan the previous month for stealing a box of gallets.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the ‘northern paradox’: the northern regions are at the same time those where they are registered - but more integration and more work - but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the North League -
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Also the new legislation loved by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: \"Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism\"
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The university rental market does not know about the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to bear, explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities strong demand has completely deformed the market to such an extent that it triggers a process of widespread increase even for residents -
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, unlimited canon contracts, under linked leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed which, through the review of tax taxation, can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (the Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University(San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is only economical if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 for an individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you can use 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
in the smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and outside the Community is more common, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students in respect of Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical halls
The historical cinemas close by favoring the Multiplexes.
\"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind town, it's like a face without eyes\"
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methicones on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historic places, full of memory, -as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion were shared\", observes the director of the new Paradise cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the jury's grand prize to Cannes, who told the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia for the way to live the cinema that may be lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay the most are the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures are as first, Emilia-Romeña with 82 less cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves have recorded the largest number of new methicone cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 be in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian exercise has developed irrationally» notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, - it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methicones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year’.
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first such in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono saloon is in the historical center that in the periphery.
The proposed rules include means of tax facilitation in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers may enter the restricted traffic area and have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like” notes Giuseppe Tornatore — and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in place.
It is true that in order to counter the extra power of the methicones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the \"New Paradise cinema\" that I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Way already closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side\".
A link between politics and 'drangheta', the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
\"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the piromalli shell\"
The charges that the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria give to the commander and vice commander of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the commander of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
He also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandchild lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and compensated 10 million euros.
\"Unappreciating any legal and moral rule, and in good sense,\" the prosecutors wrote, \"the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel Piromalli.
\"The Mafia family would have been allowed,\" the judges wrote, \"to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and control of the public administration.\"
The president of the regional board of the Calabrés Agazio Loire does not hide that - agreements between the organized bad life there is a lot - in his region: - There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean -
This morning's arrests are added to those of the past July after the police announced the headcut of the Mafia Pyromalli family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the responsibility of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a leader, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the battle in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right-center coalition.
I blow up a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was Marco Minniti at that time, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerge - the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Pyromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families -
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones go down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and are now discovering it, the major world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of raising energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, along with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new oil increase give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the sea wave movement.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Energys, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
\"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,\" said the spokesperson for a company associated with ha to the U.S. oil tanker in the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper, and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a fairly important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drillings.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good union between them.
The force of the waves, which makes moving the good up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables.
For now, there are four such developing implants, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, turns the turbine pallets, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, is now worth the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun, or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coasts, have invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008, and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
