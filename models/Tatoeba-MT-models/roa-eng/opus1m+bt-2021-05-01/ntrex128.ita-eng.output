The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned to \"make the appearance of clowns\"
There is dismay among some members of the Assembly in view of the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal came out as a result of the programmes to change the name of the assembly in Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly stated that his party is concerned that he could have remarried with Twp and Pwp.
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole - was not happy - and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be \"open\" towards the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the English pronunciation of the letter U in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently being drafted for the introduction of the amendments to the names, said: \"The final decision on possible descriptors of what will be called the members of the Assembly will obviously be an issue of debate for the members themselves\"
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed wide support for the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a scratch for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AM will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the referendum polls on the modification of the country name
On Sunday the voters will decide whether to change the name of their country in the \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to put an end to an ongoing dispute for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has stated that the name of its neighbour north represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said that he will not take the result of the vote into account.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shut up while Harlem's churches are in trouble
\"The elders I talked to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,\" Adams said.
\"Today there is none of the two\"
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people regularly attend”
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
\"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,\" he says, \"and for this reason they will rush to the moment when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become a member of these churches\"
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that prayed in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of 125th Street dealers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon - the bells of the poor -
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: \"A cultural treasure\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument\"
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon at the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese - to try to discharge the costs - on the parish assembly although the latter was not involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old fishing in California
Official sources declare that Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobster in California, during the opening day of the August season.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV San Diego that half an hour ago he was diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was just enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then - he realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was morsicated!
I've been morsicated!
His entire clavicle was lacerated, - he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
\"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'\" added Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital hospital in San Diego, where he was found in critical conditions.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that several weeks earlier a shark had been sighted in the area, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a boost to the beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in fashion sectors and household items decrease, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to television sets, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double the size of his offer of beauty items to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those present in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by the younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorisations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened at Croydon, in southern London while a second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards the purchase of small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the sales point will more and more resemble large warehouses while the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's introduced the Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given impetus to food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restore enamel to its parts of beauty products and pharmaceuticals ended up in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of a wide range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have transformed the appearance of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to respond to all needs and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping -
Peter Jones - furious - after Holly Willoughby shows up to an agreement of 11 million pounds
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million pound contract with his trend brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Truly matches and accessories.
The activity of the couple had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew's.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, resorted to Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left her Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their lucrative branding activity at the last minute to focus on her new outstanding contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones was \"furious\" when the golden girl on TV admitted in a tense meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million pounds - did not leave him enough time to dedicate themselves to their brandings and accessories Truly.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrow's Goop and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's heritage, estimated around the 11 million pounds.
As soon as Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his Truly abandonment, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: \"Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be his long-term future that would have engaged her for the next twenty years.
His decision to quit left all the people totally involved without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products in Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold -
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of the strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the ITV program \"I'm A Celebrity\"
A source close to Jones said last night that \"he doesn't want to comment on his business\"
Hard words and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticisms he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged - not presidential - and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the \"telelegial conductor\"
\"I haven't given up anything\"
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an \"equivalent response\" from the US to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to keep the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
\"With North Korea we are achieving great results,\" he said.
\"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent report -
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have proved positive: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the liberation of hostages and the repatriation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right in front of us,” Trump said, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravage an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
\"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated,\" Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will meet in Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of human life.
In the best conditions, moving among the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put in the centre of his election campaign the improvement of infrastructure in Indonesian brands and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is pairing against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point on the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 25 metres from Chelsea's door, with his team below for 1-0.
He hit the left handball before he hit the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned to the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and sank into the net.
“I was just trying to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible” Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled it out.\"
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The centerpiece of the Blue has passed from heel to Mateo Kovacic before skiing away near the middle of the camp and taking off in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick half-field pass.
So he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame his defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-wing goal beyond the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round-the-clock phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia reached 832, the country's disaster management agency declared on Sunday morning.
A large number of people were reported trapped between the wrecked buildings as a result of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been scattered of debris from the collapsed buildings.

I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on dashcam, so that they can contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation.
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was admitted is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the place of the reunion this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment but has been notified by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained speechless when he found out what had happened.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of \"rescripture of history\"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a \"folly\" and a \"try to rewrite history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: \"It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of the statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster became an objective.
Iconoclasty during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe must still be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case, of course of monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of that fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated.
Killer pig shoots a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China on the news broadcast by local media.
The man, identified only with the surname \"Yuan\" was found dead with a recessed artery, covered with blood near a pig at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs vaccines into a farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
It is reported that he had traveled with the cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pig pig with blood on the muse.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had cracked the farmer, according to the declarations.
\"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and slaughtered,\" said the cousin identified with the surname \"Wu\" as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was shut down to prevent them from attacking other people, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serial injuries to man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife managed to throw out the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a \"catalizer\"
I just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect, he explained.
The raisins of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and the south-western coast of the USA in the next few days.
Rosa recorded twenty up to 138 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a saccharging of the Pacific Ocean is forming and is moving eastward towards the western coast of the USA. While Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Thus, tropical humidity in contact with the approaching bag will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona areas.
Precipitations of 2.5-10 cm of rain are expected in some areas of the south-west, particularly in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make rivers canyons full and the tempores will bring wind to blows and raise dust.
The approaching sack will cause severe rainfall at the local level on the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery floats.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona by the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become wider at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong oscillations of temperatures in the USA while the Arctic cools, but the tropics will stay warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to important changes in temperature over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected a hot start of October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York, you can reach 26 degrees Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our weather forecasts for the long-term indicate high probability of temperatures above the average for the eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the winning deposition by the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last minute on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of herbour and tried to strip her during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflammatory deposition, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average hearing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty with the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that for a football game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionaries strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, guided all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing lasted the entire day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a statement stating that it would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken over by operators of the CNN and CBS on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes while being reproached and broadcast live on CNN.
\"I'm right here in front of you,\" said a woman.
Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
He was told, \"She has power while many women are powerless\"
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that it would have had other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would have done so only with the assurance that the FBI would have analysed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the Democratics of the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"making politics\" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his programmes of letting the European Union - political face - with the future of Britain and jeopardising the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit agreement, stating that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU must collect their duties is - absolutely ridiculous -
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrest the suspect of the death of the LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspected firearm death suspect by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge Police Department declared.
The authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson match, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, he notified the defense attorney.
East Baton Rouge's legal doctor's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task-force for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the police scientist's laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area who assisted the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the zone order for their commitment and the search for justice -
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was \"convolved\" and \"under shock\" for Wayde's death.
\"This is what you worry about at all times,\" Wade said.
Volcano ash cosparge Mexico City
The ashes that emerges from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the various wrecks and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysical noted an increase in activity in correspondence to the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot squads and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-smoker police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually stumble tourists.
Further collisions took place during the day with police officers who resorted to manganes to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang \"We will not forget, we will not forgive\" compared themselves with the Unionist demonstrators who shouted \"Long live Spain\"
The local press reported that 14 people had to receive cures for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx was low, and the Catalans against secession had greatly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place in the entire region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had packed up on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he had no hope of becoming independent.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at the possibility of voting, but now everything is blocked, - he explained.
Despite having gained a fundamental victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians of the two factions.
\"The situation is increasingly tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the European Parliament elections next year.
\"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the evolution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,\" he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after repeatedly beating against a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7.30 p.m. BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that the car has been hit with a crossbow at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers astonished relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved into the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a home win in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first in Hearts ranking, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile the Livingston continues its winning series in the division remaining unbeatable for six games, with coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused Ranger many problems.
Scott Robinson crashed but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out the door after he joined in to meet Craig Halkett's head shot at the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put visitors with their heels in trouble.
And it was so that the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a punishment football and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to move on to Menga, which was able to mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated in the possession of ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the foot of the Rangers Porter Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot off another Livingston game scheme.
Crosses happened in the Livingston area and were continually neutralized, while two strict demands, after Halkett's contrast with the Glenn Middleton substitute and one for hand failure, were refused.
A \"fenomale\" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and the collaborators have changed very little from their return to the top series, but you have to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he has managed to spray the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in charge of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below these standards.
The last passage was missing - only once they were able to penetrate the opposing area - and one can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in half rank.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distangling relations between NATO allies.
Issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU have been countered.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police have motivated with security reasons the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in battle with a car
A cyclist died in a car match in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road of Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the Saturday incident occurred.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and bus diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the maximum-security male prison, reported to the prison office.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin's maximum-security male prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents - Tornado - have been used to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison wing.
The agents were treated on the spot for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: \"Personal prison specially trained has been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison -
Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sommosa agents were called to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (of which may benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the south-west of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to Southern and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service reported in a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the border of Arizona -
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes provide for precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-western area, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of these rainfalls will probably be positive because the South-West area is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the drought monitoring center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category, - reportedweather.com.
Initially the route of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land on the mainland through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force on Sunday morning at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will strike with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitations on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high flood risk.
‘Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning with tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and towards southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
\"The main risk that Rosa or her strasses can cause is intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the USA,\" the National Center for Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to generate potentially lethal sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Aggression: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gun injuries in the Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in stable conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18 years old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who might have recovered with the telephone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered for the democratic party's abuse and anger.
\"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh was suffering from the democratic party's ill-treatment and anger during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh deposed before Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decided Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual violence against him decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also deposed the hearing in defense of the prosecution.
The President said on Saturday that - the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage - of Kavanaugh on that day.
\"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced minds of the law of our time, a lawyer with previously unattainable public service,\" he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of republican influence in midterm elections.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really doing it, he said.
\"This is why the lot for exceptional candidates\"
Trump stated that the Democrats are committed to \"resisting and hindering\"
The first fundamental procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to what a senior assistant to the GOP Directorate told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunamis, and the figures of the victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when an earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when high waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at the dusk, sweeping many people away killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat of tsunamis came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims,” said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
“The tsunami did not come alone, dragged by cars, logs, houses, struck anything on the mainland,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/hour (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, contoured and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The settlement shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released from the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as \"extesi\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications - have been totally paralyzed, with no information - from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area - the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,\" he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you feel a man on a top floor of a building that screams excitedly to warn of incoming tsunamis people in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, sweeping through buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an enormous blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army began sending air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget of the tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff at Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge under strips of wax in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
\"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups have begun the difficult start-up operations of the relief gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
\"This is still a provincial disaster,\" said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"When the government says, \"O.K., this is a national disaster - we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined\"
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the scattered people still kept hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of the natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a drain.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the scattered paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
\"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load,\" he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray splinter rather than two blue marks.
“I think it means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Ruban thieves $26,750 during a cash supply at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM in Newport on the Levee, being at a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver was emptying a ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver more money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man -- he got behind Brink's employee -- and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, being informed, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: \"The person formally known as Kanye West\"
West, 41, has been nicknamed Yes for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change occurred before his participation in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
The program replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for \"emotive reasons\" declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
\"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you',\" said West at the beginning of the year, speaking of the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
\"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our wickedness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are -
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
A former co-worker from West, JAY-Z, has also changed his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody rapture against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use the army to punish the Mexican people”
The soldiers had shot a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking their feet throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by electing monthly student grants and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for the AI
While China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the research funds in this field, says IA Kai-Fu Lee's investor and operator, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several groups of the US government about the AI, although in the USA there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be country no. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
\"Dubling the budget in the quest for the IA would be a good start considering that all the other countries are far behind the USA and we need a new revolution in the IA,\" Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next great success in the AI sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book -AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order - was published this month by publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American player of Otello with the highest score and later was leading at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google section.
Lee recalled the previous U.S. government technology contests such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to hold the next one, to be able to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
\"It's not China that's driving academic leaders away, it's multinationals,\" said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the field of AI.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese Council of State published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organizations distribute funds to researchers in the USA, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. order to create a National Commission for Safety on Artificial Intelligence has not registered activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in the \"Republic of North Macedonia\" - a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which has blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and placed the veto at the entrance of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have reached agreement in June on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents believe that change should damage the ethnic identity of the population of Macedonia by a Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote at the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the influx will reach the least 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum form is as follows: ‘It is in agreement with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece —
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
\"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us,\" Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that it will respect the result of the vote in order to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority to stand.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters expressed their vote.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,\" said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change of the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and the European Union accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and fixing the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up, not for the service door,\" Kavadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration -
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
\"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after voting.
He said that one - yes - would be the - confirmation of our future -
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the phylo-Western government since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the match won for 2-0 from Manchester City Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero seemed extremely easy his point marked at 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the action.
He moved among three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero therefore found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming several others at the Brighton area.
So he took a left passage, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's door with a right-hand shot in the network.
“Aguero is having foot problems,” said City coach Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
\"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that time -
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of the Sky Blues in the struggle for the Premier League.
The goal came at 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball off the grid just before he got out of the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one recapture with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
“Even if we play without objective, we can at least be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level of all this year.
And why should I never want to fight -
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, on Thursday he held a launch session and would be the first launcher on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump to a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
\"All we've done is put in play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving myself to do for this I fight for excellent candidates - he said.
Trump continued: \"We see this awful group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see badness, meanness.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to trip in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them to them.
The democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of \"resisting and hindering\"
\"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days,\" he said, calling the democrats - angry, bad, petty and liars -
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong fists among the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document to go through?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I look like a - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcome, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The opinion for the Friday Nottingham East Labour meeting states that - we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive -
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, the Friday evening meetings were exactly that way.
However, today it is not this tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a policy - more kind and courteous - has been forgotten for a long time, if ever it has been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All this started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought of sharing a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of tendencies from me and to take positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - it follows inventive insults on social media that ask for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the center and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments I make to me tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a multitude of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the standardization of levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party restricts itself.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything - would be fine -
But that's not what I got into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the incursiveness of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally to pieces, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it, as a local advisor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way dismayed by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family nuclei, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those who I think are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeated Ayr scales the class
Two late attempts might in some way have undermined the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now on top of the rankings, the only team in ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, who pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
\"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy,\" said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"We need to acknowledge the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of the opportunities of us\"
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to advantage, but a yellow sign for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, allowed the Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climate has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigour before, in the middle of time, to mark and then to convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second time and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was pushed out, and at restarting, the Ayr was pushed back into advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr Blair Macpherson's replacement captain received a yellow sign and Melrose paid the man extra with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of strong pressure.
But the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's forward mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had picked up football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game Star is looking for a new restaurant career
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which writes and plays with the long-standing partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's \"prosper food trade\"
The sea is ours: Bolivia without a glimpse of the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered with sarths in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the river of the Amazons are decorated with the motto: \"The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty -
In the whole of Bolivia with no outlet on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to once again seek the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court welcomes Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-elections next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
\"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,\" he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide for Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
\"The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,\" said Zárate.
Morale's belligerant rhetoric has choked any remaining good intention of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able - to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile - and will have the opportunity to - put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantage - he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political scam.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
\"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past\"
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the US
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never carry out disarmament by nuclear weapons if it will not be able to trust Washington before.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to be faithful to the promises made during Singapore's summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be planning to resume diplomatic negotiations in a state of readiness after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an \"illusion\" that the continuation of the US sanctions and opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the declaration without first Pyongyang carrying out important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President USA Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is intended to give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows have the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to extend your collection of blankets or completely block the sun's rays, do not look beyond.
The Valentino and Thom Browne stylists have revealed a series of crazy oversize covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have angered Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their engaging creations on the walkway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a broad edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled corners, a witch hat and even an pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a loose iced cone.
And if you continue with the enormous style statements, you're lucky.
The watchers of style predict that the huge berets could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the edge of \"The Bomba - the straw hat with a wide thesis more than one meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that invaded the social media has sent another huge creation on the bridge: a beach bag in straw as big as the pattern in costume that brings it.
The bag in raffia color orange burned, finished with fringe in raffia and with a handle in white leather was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrities designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: \"I expect these large beach hats and bags will arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the designer has achieved such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories\"
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of exceptional results to the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and required within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart -
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the ranks, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest of the votes.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of the students obtained the highest vote in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a matter choice, are considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty of covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more work opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real benefit in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, in particular those of the developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with the personal teacher specialized in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as \"international communication competences\"
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entrance with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-camped Sunday opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be established for how many minutes it will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the trainings at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six Lakers Pre-Camping Games program.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare myself,” he said.
The moment of meeting an West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally break.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation pending for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress at the November elections.
What time will Trump's commission be at, and how can you follow it online?
Trump's commission in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump commission in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have become stubborn because of the sexual violence charges with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of events is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little boost.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings during the next week are aimed at giving energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies, being in Reuters.
\"The control of Congress is so crucial to its programme that the President will travel in as many states as possible while we go into the most busy season of the campaign,\" said a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, tonight's commission could call supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media coverage of Pittsburgh,\" being at the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he had won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, a policeman at West Virginia University, staying at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sundays
After three one-way sessions, the Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum bike is a fully invented sports concept in which players believe firmly and never as in races like these.
So where's the bike now?
\"They had an advantage of six points and now there are four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike,\" Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel like they have a little wind in favour, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful, not lastly the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each has three points on four.
Spieth was ruthless by the green tea and is giving the example.
The guttural screams of celebration became stronger as the match continued, sinking a crucial putt to pair the accounts to game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who won them the 15-hole match was accepted with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
\"You really have to put it all to worry about your game,\" Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untrustworthy version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the noisy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular Fleetwood or Molinari player to seal a possible European victory while the sun collapses on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European glory talks are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly reached Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have starved the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even been able to get back.
However, Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
The fourballs and ovens are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and that they do not give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing the fourball and Saturday forsome matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National up to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on an irregular American team in the morning's fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted most in the furnaces, winning two matches, but failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European leader to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat down an overcrowded Woods and American former Bryson Dechambeau with an even lighter 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional space of genius but lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and the foursomes and seven queues.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's furballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the forsomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results hoped for in a pleasant and ventilated day to the south-west of Paris.
Three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a grintous 2&1 win on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team returned from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as the holder, Furyk's team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to untrustworthy unilateral disarmament
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated on Saturday that the maintenance of the sanctions was inescapable of the country's failure in the USA, that under these circumstances it would absolutely refuse to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted - important measures of good will - last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"However, we do not see any consistent answers from the USA,\" he said.
\"Without trust in the USA, there will be no security in our national security, and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally for the first time.\"
Although Ri has re-used Washington's note of resistance to denuclearisation - in phases - with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement has been important because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearisation as already done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised assurances to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end agreement to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
\"The USA insists on the need to \"first have denuclearisation\" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even oppose the \"declaration of the end of the war\" said Ri.
The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust -
Ri did not refer to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the leader of the USA had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: \"If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead\"
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year at the UN General Assembly, when he claimed that it was inevitable to target the territory of the United States with the missiles of North Korea after the President of Evil Trump had called Kim a \"missile man\" engaged in a suicide mission.
First to the United Nations Trump, which last year had threatened to \" completely destroy\" North Korea, has poured praise on Kim for its courage in undertaking the course of disarmament, but has stated that it must still be done a lot and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump stated that he does not have a deadline, stating that if it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.
Cine and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: \"The compliance of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and ascertained denuclearisation is achieved.\"
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
It was broken down by Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of presenting — gangster’s claims —
North Korea had engaged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the USA had adopted - measures in accordance with -
He said that Kim had explained to him that the \"conforming measures\" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had engaged in Singapore and actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year pushed all of its students to sleep more in an attempt to counteract the growing virile culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A university scholar noted that students at university number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this only now told me, when I’m at the last year?’
He said that no one had ever told him anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much - he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
An hour's course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gymnastics shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
\"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes - Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride linked to the \"night in white to study\" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to fight stress, weariness, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain in ways of inedia, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar study program before joining this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the \"blue light\" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm in tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal dropped Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another depression attack from outside the house with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first home win from the February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard's second defeat in 18 coach matches leaving his team eight points from the escape leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers training never seemed able to stand.
As the Ranger now descends to sixth place, the Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for different goals.
And there could be further problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence wake was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently launched from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, has chosen the usual training that has ripped a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents every round.
The Rangers may have mastered for ball possession but Livingston took better advantage of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's first-time filter passage sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment football by Keaghan Jacobs therefore found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow could only pull sideways on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly considered it necessary to see himself assigning a rigour to the end of the fifteenth following a fight with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the door in the first time but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let worry about the head of Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opening goal of Livingston at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact since the wing shoved a ball in Morelos, but the outstanding Kelly threw himself out of the doorline to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton presented a last strict request after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and CONTEGGIO continues... the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A firm point of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado,\" interpreted by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: -What the hell is that -
Rogers: It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in minerals -
Evans: \"After a while he's just bursting now\"
\"Hans - Geiger died in 1945, only a few days from his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ the malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
Therefore, they can see a protein common to many types of tumors and are then reinjected.
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland said: \"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2 protein - promotes the growth of different types of tumors - including breast, ovaries, lungs and the right- colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to teach them how to affect tumor cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA cap (Make America Great Again) after it appears on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stabbed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after an unconvelled performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be running in 2020.
After interpreting his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA hat, he started a riot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"Many times I talk to white people and they say to me, \"As you may like Trump, he's a racist.\"
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star has taken on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against the accusations of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been transmitted, the recording of the filippic of West was loaded on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained with the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his blanket.
They bullied me in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And so they told me I'm an outcast - he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"You want to see the place submerged,\" and he said, \"I would take the mantle from Superman because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love.
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL cast were embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the periodical: \"A mortal silence fell on the studio\"
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised by Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA group of conservatives, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest spirits: GROWS TO EVER TEST THE MASS”
But the conductor of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West was simply - what it is and this is simply wonderful -
\"But I've chosen NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his \"art\" which I think is embracing a vomity ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, - he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now the person previously known as Kanye West.
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg became named Snoop Lion and of course the missing musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.

Space Throne Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity · Global Voices
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Space Throne.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such on-screen soils often make the boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview at The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that something had gone wrong and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Tron of Spade, 31 years old, admitted to a lot of concern about this problem.
'Personally I am very concerned, at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are watching now?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because of course something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel of Throne of Spade once the series ended next summer, stating that he had finished with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best thing happened with Tron of Spade.
\"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on,\" she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, Kit's character, in Emmy's fantasy winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV- and AIDS-affected citizens.
More than 820,000 people suffer from these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to what the Chinese health authorities have said during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff had the GOP Senators data hacked, and talks about \"dangerous candles\" and \"conspiracy theories\"
The U.S. MP complained on Saturday about charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information by three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The democratic MP of Los Angeles said that the statements were fostered by opinionists and websites of the ultra-right wing.
\"Bugies, lies and still disgusting lies,\" Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information would include the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing by a committee of experts on the accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the post source has been associated with the Waters office and have issued information regarding a Waters staff member.
\"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,\" Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of these false and biased accusations, was not in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie -
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
\"This lie is furious,\" Fleischer wrote.
This implies that it does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He must not question the defendant's reasons.
It should remain calm and serene -
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the critics of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate on the run to depose Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
\"Enormous if confirmed, and twittered.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office alerted the competent authorities and the forces of order of these biased statements.
\"We will make sure that those responsible are exposed,\" he continued, \"and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff\"
Review by Johnny English still hits - spy parody with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
The veil of self-willingness on how much we waste will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for non-English film producers countries.
Obviously it is the foolish secret agent who despite his strange pretense of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to Gloria's theme of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games of London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious traveler and international man who once played atkinson in the now forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, who left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the elks screech briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the mood seems rather undersized and oddly superfluous, especially now that film brands -series - such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The mood seems directed to children rather than adults and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent movies when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of unchangeable current is now the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the Supersecret Web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with disposing of the officer in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that causes the vase to stumble for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a blow of political impoverishment: Emma Thompson does her best with this simil-Teresa May character but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the damn Johnny English, who now works as a school leader in a chic facility, but who also teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a spy course like School of Rock.
English is met in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role as a high society girl in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of the disaster for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the left Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they spark hell by smuggled into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take dimesticity with the inside of the house of Volta.
All of the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but no matter how grumpy and exuberant, there's a lot of children's TV all over the story.
Everything is quite modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be developing a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: \"Behind the end of the year we are expected to announce a review of the political line\"
\"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy\"
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: \"A four-day working week is not part of the political line of the party and is not currently under discussion\"
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from \"faceless leaders\" and \"speculators\" in companies for public services.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement \"deductions\" on the basis of behaviors considered illegal.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees on business boards and create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 % of the net assets of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up putting up annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say at -60 Minutes - if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court of at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the government agency may influence or not some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will go on Sunday, the correspondent of -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Kennedy.
\"I said it while I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that he came out of that charge, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal -
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
\"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett energetically denied it,\" Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever you're calling couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change -
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable star ride and has an equally remarkable mission: ending poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people come to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience of the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or - actions - such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful was the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way of persuading people to ask for an appeal for action, or is it just another example of the so-called ‘clicktivism’ - people who really feel that they make the difference simply by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million actions of its supporters, working for a wide range of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to call on world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which they have already been disbursed or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far the protected capital funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and executors, committed to — helping children grow to the maximum of their potential — with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
\"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,\" said The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were put in place calling on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions for nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on your website, you asked: “What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty”
Global Citizen replied: \"It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement - a blockade - and hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where he is working on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern core of Europe,\" he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with you.
\"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed the defendants at the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defined the \"voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
\"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial leverage and replace fuels,\" he said, referring to Russia as \"unversal\" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of North Stream 2, an inappropriate gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a prisoner in Moscow.
Moscow has pointed out several times that North Stream 2, spent from 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of merely economic nature.
The Cremlin object that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is guided simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,\" said the Minister of Russian Energy Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The U.S. position triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of European Union energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take - seriously - to apply for the presidency in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will take a \"serious consideration\" to apply for president following the mid-term elections.
During an assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed to contemplate the possibility of candidates.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our bad government in place, and that means having a woman to the summits,\" said The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider applying for president
During the city assembly Warren said his on President Donald Trump, stating that he was - bringing this country in the wrong direction -
\"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,\" he said.
Warren was expressed in criticising Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: \"It is natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote\"
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should apply in 2020.
58 percent of \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32% supported such an application.
The survey resulted in greater support for an application by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent to support a potential application and 48 percent to the contrary.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed on a potential nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“What my son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disturbances and some of the injuries our soldiers return with,” he told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest - the elephant in the room - and said, of his son and other war veterans, - they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country -
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic assault and violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of a firearm under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and District of Columbia Friday presented a memory of friendly curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He stated that his partner, and his violent sons, gang members, abused her, but the officials of the United States rejected his request for asylum on 20 July.
He was put in a state of detention in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations that face devastating problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The United States' new asylum policy overturned a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed to submit a request for asylum to immigrants with no documents fleeing from domestic violence.
Friday the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared that the new policy - ignored decades of state, federal and international law -
\"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be judged on the basis of particular circumstances and circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle\" is stated in the memory of amicius curiae.
Within the memory the prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants damages the economy of the United States, affirming the clear probability that these become entrepreneurs and -they provide the necessary labour -
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration courts not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
\"Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecutions or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for a political opinion,\" said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought to mitigate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the budget of the dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
\"There's a lot of tension,\" said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little feverish child in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
\"At every moment, there's an ambulance that carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce -
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, ruining among their fraudulent personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were broken.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a back and shoulder fracture, rested outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the continued severe siege.
He filled his eyes with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
\"There was no time to save us.\"
\"I was crushed into the wall's rubble, I think,\" Haris reported to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
\"I heard my wife scream to ask for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"making prepotences\" with \"advertising propaganda\"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a US newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
United States Last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China rejects.
The prosecution moved by Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to get involved in the US elections, noted what the United States officials told Reuters to be a new phase of a Washington-based escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalation trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their respective imports.
China's reprisal duties at the beginning of the commercial war had been intended to hit exporters in States such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have stated.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, - now increases those prepotences by publishing advertising on our free newspapers -
\"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,\" Branstad wrote.
\"Viceversa, in the building on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm fist of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He added that \"one of the most important newspapers in China has missed the offer to publish\" his article, although he has not stated that it is a newspaper.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various accusations of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, in the future mid-term elections.
The unrest in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to proceed with a vote.
\"These things cannot be withdrawn,\" said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute's insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
\"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November - declared Friday, as reported in Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the MoveOn Progressive Group.
Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan - November is coming - during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's application despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
\"People say they were already tall; it is true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians of the suburbs and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even though they do not like the president -
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his accusations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have been verified if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
\"For the GOP has become a confusing set,\" said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News at the beginning of last week.
\"Not only is it about the vote for the committee, the final one, or if Kavanaugh will be put in the bench, it is also about the way the Republicans have managed the situation and the way they have treated it,\" noted the news channel Guy Cecil, Director of Priorityities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent stated that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate's Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted him in a state of Judaism when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to him during a party during his studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can have access to and to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent hidden behind Inrupt is \"dominating the world\"
\"We have to do it now,\" he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own - online personal data store - or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on a single browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is completely at the user's choice who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it \"personal power through data\"
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make it accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't tell -Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely ridden from one day to the next.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that \"Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built from Solid\"
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastic of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The Church of England's only ecclesiastical one to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was recognized on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative slab.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that it was \"magnificantly symbolic\" the fact that the stone would have been inaugurated exactly 100 years from his grandfather's award-winning production.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal, through a sharp fog under heavy fire from the field and war machines.
Then he hurried towards the line of fire and with the \"greater gallantry\" he made the line forward before having run with a single hand cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were \"something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that \"he felt truly honored to play a role in the parade,\" and added, \"the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people.\"
MMA fans stood all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in the United Kingdom were stout when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some have remained grounded after being awake until early in the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the passage to cartoon for children as “a kind of joke of bad taste”
\"The government's regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to the children's programming,\" said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transmission.
- Peppa the pig - - yes -
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
\"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,\" Coker said.
\"But there are six Sunday mornings and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came in and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize that until he arrived at secondary school, that - not everyone is like me -
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give \"hope\" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made it easier for him to win the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for disease.
Presenting herself as an marginalized woman in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt less than anyone else as he grew up because - it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls -
He said, \"Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed.\"
He wanted to try to be \"something,\" he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The double bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high profile LGBT activist and used his face in this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt lucky he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three times world champion said that having fallen in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - - he caught me by surprise -
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
\"When he was so young,\" he said, \"he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later,\" he said, \"it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective has changed.
\"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that \"I had to win a gold medal,\" he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie -
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked for was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be here so I could be in the front row, Dad',\" he said.
\"I was holding my hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible,\" he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
\"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympics, there was no better feeling,\" she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a particular meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still causes him to come the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The off form Mickelson put in the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an infidel billion stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelve-time record, was put in the panchina by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the Saturday foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has often been for the United States, the five times the champion spent the day between acting as cheerleader and working on his game in the range, hoping to correct what plagues him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48 year old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unknown path regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the path itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, faces the careful champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, of four points below the beginning of their 12 individual games, start with a bulging start, Mickelson's match might be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he will be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk told.
\"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else -
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even far mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 matches twenty, 20 defeats and seven bets, even though Furyk said his presence has brought intangible goods to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, bold, he likes to play people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
“I also think that younger players have enjoyed citing against him this week, something that has been fun to look at.
He's done much more than play -
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in individual meetings on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, arrived at the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
\"I kept telling myself that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost it, and in Valderrama where we won, but a little bit,\" said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
\"So it will be the story to prove to me and to my team that it is not over.
Tomorrow we have to make the most of it.
We need to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world -
Happy the way hers competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: \"I would never have overcome myself.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to send to players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he also has to go there and get out the best of himself -
Unlike Bjorn, the counterpart Jim Furyk will seek in his players the best individual performance rather than team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself was found on both sides in those great last day meetings, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the \"Miracle of Medinah\" European.
\"I remember every single word\" he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players to his head on the last day.
- Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the match starts taking a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate matches.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we feel appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counter-offensive and facing Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the route to the end,” Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to the local media, the latest German military navy frigate had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the cold war times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and an impennade of costs.
The committee of Rheinland-Pfalz, the admiral ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesperson.
The ship was due to join the Military Navy in 2014, but worrying questions following delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new ones up to two years away from the national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will become obsolete when they come into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of \"software and hardware\" crucial that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has emerged that the ship weighs heavily too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the Military Navy adding future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initials of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Military Navy in fact - is carrying ships capable of being employed -
The official stated that the issue has become significantly worse over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Military Navy.
The National Trust spys on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal the way bats use sight to obtain food.
It is trusted that the discoveries can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, in addition to brown ears and bats at the Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of the pipistrulli calls and the manner in which each species behaves.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, consultant for nature protection for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to keep forests for bats and other related species at best.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined considerably in the last century.
The bats are at risk because of construction and development works that concern trespolis and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grasping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the Trespolies and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even set up the first reservation of Scotland intended only for bats at the Treave estate, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which houses eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
\"Here in Three we have a vast area for bats,\" he said.
We have the old buildings, many centuries old trees and a good habitat.
But there is a lot on bats that we still do not know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about their need for growth -
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trespoule can kill up to 400 females and small, perhaps by sweeping out an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, molest them, disturb them or destroy their trespolies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going through it.\"
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawmakers sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the charges of rape against him as \"false news,\" claiming that people - they want to be advertised - with his name.
His legal officers prepare to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the charge of $375,000 to keep silence on the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke the statements as \"false news\"
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false - says the five times Golden Balloon turned to the camera.
They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything is fine - added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's legal officers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the charges, which are defined as an inadmissible indication of suspicions about the private sphere.
Counsel Christian Schertz has stated that the footballer will seek compensation for - moral damages to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the breach of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years -
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Casino Resort.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the footballer's room, where he subjected it to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have got on his knees after the event by saying he was for 99% - a \"good boy - disappointed by a percent -
From the documents it appears that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also states that she has gone to the police and hospital, where her injuries have been photographed, but that she has subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt - terrified by the retaliatory - and concerned about the prospect of becoming publicly humiliated -
The 34-year-old now tries to reverse the agreement, claiming that she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer will join the Italian Juventus with a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom - it may forever regret - the loss of its world leader status in car building following Brexit, Minister of Industry Greg Clark said.
He also added that he was \"concerned\" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent momentary blockade of production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need an agreement,\" said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car company argues that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
\"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,\" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Director-General at Burnaston.
Increases concern in other English car manufacturers about exit from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the supply chain risks encountered by manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the concept -just in time - with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for on-order cars.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, there could be difficulties at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is precisely thought to avoid these borders.
\"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity,\" said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
\"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a successful distribution chain\"
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, states that the workers are deeply concerned: \"According to my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated\"
A spokesperson for the government said: \"We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU\"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could still be postponed, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein could be \"remended for a week\" while continuing the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House declared Sunday.
Rosenstein overrules the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's counsellors and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby risking Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
In the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a helmet to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and yelled that he was to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was then held at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's training of questions from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: \"No date has been set, it could be this week, I imagine he will ask for another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and will continue to update the press -
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has no press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefing is not due to an aversion for television journalists - who show up - although he said: \"I don't disagree with the fact that they show up\"
So he made it seem that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
\"The president has more Question and Answer sessions than any president before him,\" he said, adding without citing the evidence: \"We have checked the figures\"
Briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
Let us try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can speak with the President of the United States -
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably proved his point, making a free-wheeled speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance from the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of requests for settled status (stable resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: \"All summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only have valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities to whom we provide a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here -
Christion Abercrombie was urgently operated following a head injury
The defender of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after bringing a head wound to the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
\"He approached on board camp and passed out,\" said Reed.
First aid personnel and medical personnel administered Abercrombie of the oxygen on board camp, before putting it in the barrel and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State leader reported to Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that - there is still no news about the type and extent of the damage - and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is at his first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five plates before leaving the game, which brought his total of season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bail taxes for purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the laborers
The move will neutralize Corbyn's success of attracting young voters
The increase in the tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, will announce today Theresa May.
The manoeuvre will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in the tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The overcrowding, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the property buy to lets (purchases to be rented), could constitute more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry expects the manoeuvre to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of the new constructions in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first home in the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become a ghost city because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy arrives a few weeks after Boris Johnson had requested a cut on the bubble tax to help the younger with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by catching land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to fix the British real estate disparaging.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of exciting proposals for reform of the housing market, including rental controls and the elimination of unsuspecting fraud.
He also wants to give the council greater powers on the construction of the new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: \"Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, that is, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies, as is for UK resident workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of homeless remains a reality -
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate aspiration is to lead Scotland\"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “most aspiration” is to become a manager of Scotland sooner or later.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of raising the North-East team which is currently in third place in the League One, three points from the top.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after being at St. Mirren's guide during last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in B series and that's all - Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager -
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Technician of Alloa Athletic argues that he does not feel any anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"The success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to Premier League\"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it definitely belongs to the Premier League - he said.
\"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I get the team back on track.\"
Ross's career started three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute Hearts coach.
He then helped the Alloa to save himself from the downturn to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the edge of the downturn to the title of champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more at ease now than during his career as a football player in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
‘It was probably a real turning point,’ he recalls with regard to the direction of the Alloa.
\"I really thought that the role of manager was made for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I made a living, and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with on a weekly basis.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life.

The summer hot wave has brought more charges to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales from 2.7 percent to July, while the inks of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: “The persistence of the sun and the long permanence of England to the World Cups made it possible for the month of July to follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June is worse in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink most of them were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase greater than the decrease in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered from the heat, although not too much like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while the consumption of food fell by three percent -
Paul Newman, RSM recreational and recreational analyst, said: “These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly severe in addition to continued pressure on costs.
The long warm summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we have enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce -
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent to July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-out.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the industry's reference company.
A child in five has secret social network accounts that hides from parents
A survey reveals that a child in five, some only 11 years old, has secret social network accounts that hide parents and teachers
A survey carried out on 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in pages -fakes on Instagram -
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted to the background
20% of students said they had a \"principal\" account to show parents
A child in five, some only 11 years old, creates social network accounts that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed a rapid growth of Instagram's account-fake accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they were managing a “principal” account that was cleaned up to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who discovered by chance the secret site of the 13th-year-old daughter, found a teenager urging others to \"suck me\"
The research, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters - and Headmasters - Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of the boys between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted by creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them”
Eilidh Doyle will be \"voice for athletes\" to the Council of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh has a deep respect for the Scottish, British and World athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland could bring a huge advantage by bringing it to the council,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I can’t wait to act as an athlete’s voice, and I hope I can contribute and help drive sport in Scotland.”
The American, a winner of 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC opinionist, found himself unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had an stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would have recovered and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!

The advertising of a stripe compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company producing a tiralata has divided its opinion on the net with an advertising that compares to mothers who are breast-feeding and cows who are riding.
To mark the launch of what is described as the \"first silent and wearable tilatte of the world\" the consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertising in the form of joking music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tilatette.
Four real mothers dance in a bean of cows on a track that includes songs like: \"Yes, I take my milk but I don't have one thing\" and \"If I didn't notice, these aren't breasts but my boobs\"
The choir goes on: \"Take him out, throw him out, feed the children, throw him out, throw him out, milk at my lords\"
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video gave rise to different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that it would highlight the \"horrors\" of the dairy industry.
A unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too have to stay pregnant and go out to produce milk, except that their little ones are stolen to them a few days after birth - someone wrote.
The Elvie strip is worn discreetly under a mother's bra
Someone else commented: \"Comprehensively traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, because you don't use them to advertise a mammoth strip that will continue to keep their children -
Someone else added: \"It's really a pointless advertising\"
Others have defended it and a woman has even admitted to finding the song - funny -
- I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'd like one.
When I was wearing my t-shirt, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little irrelevant but does not get far from reality.
This is a brilliant product - someone wrote.
Another person commented: \"This is a funny advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the strip (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like \"girls\"
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the home industry -
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet stripe stuck in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use tiralata feel like cows.
Elvie is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck in a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in arm and even get out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Mother’s ECD commented: “Elvie’s tiralatette is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the cow pulley, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pulley is able to ensure -
This isn't the first time the Elvie news was released.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children presented herself on the walkway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tentacles at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the Trump administration's policy line have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of the people who relied on them were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to jeopardize the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the digital fingerprints would be taken to the potential accountants and other adult members of their families and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Strength, stated before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to rely on single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people, said Albence.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard period before, according to what says who works in the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to perpetrate their cause of legal status at a court for immigration.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or escape attempts, as they say who works in the reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability that this happens is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo where, because of its size, it is easier for the discomfort signals of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tendon without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or greet their friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria intimates with the U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war had now reached the eighth year.
Mr Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy the soil illegally with the pretext of combating terrorism and will be treated accordingly.
\"I must withdraw immediately without any condition,\" he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the \"war on terrorism\" is almost over - in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories - from terrorist groups and from - any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for them to return and accused some Western countries of \"incontinuing unfounded fears\" that force refugees to stay away from their homeland.
\"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,\" he reiterated.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is being politicised”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be granted in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a coscinating zone in Idlib, the last important stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack of the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Mr Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement needed deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the al-Nusra Front fighters connected with Al-Qaeda, who will be eradicated.
The envoy of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene a new committee of government members and opposition to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee by stating that the work of the group must be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution without interference.
Because Trump will add the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many of the Liberals might expect, his presidency should not end prematurely because of impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be - the most dramatic presidency ending ever -
At the moment, there are no sign of the spectators' bending.
Since 2014, the first night's percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" program has exceeded the percentages of the network by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
“This is a fire to which people are attracted because it’s not something to be explained,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC’s television series “Designed Survivor”, which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In the Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club” has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, \"Why does he make me laugh?\"
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether the immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to meet for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book \"Pura\" of Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket - a garment full of tracotancy - commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Storm Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, will no longer be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
\"Part of the reason why what he does seems like a reality show is that every night there are new news,\" says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of \"Pawn Stars\" about the advent of actors and the daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and meanwhile registered the CNN.
He couldn't get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in front of the future uncertain Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: \"I remember when we used to do all those crazy programs and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.\"
\"I thought it was a joke, but they were right\"

External money flow in the middle-term narrower elections race
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congress district that has made it possible for two members in office now to run for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings to the stage the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who conquered his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania district that overlaps the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that in the old districts the election colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Congressional Committee Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump awarded the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalise El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their mind
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a very friendly meeting was held between the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leader group to leave.
The officials of the State Department decided to bring the heads of the American diplomatic missions to El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama after the \"recent decision not to recognise Taiwan\" said the spokesperson for the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from Americans of aid for drug traffic control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which has been seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of reproach or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who nevertheless wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In his report, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now seems to have enough evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress were to pass on to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these charges before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his own just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the fall of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organise a coup against Hitler if Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed by letting us escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans at the moment have to deal with it differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this particular newspaper reported that last year she secretly suggested to submit Trump to intercepts by questioning his ability to take over the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news on The Times is not true.
How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will the mid-term elections vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to its actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future -

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for the G Group of Europe League.
Although due to a knee injury the midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
“For us it was a positive result because the Villarreal is a good team,” said the player thirty-monthly.
\"We faced the game convinced to do well and brought home a point.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the tie is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game. However, I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will be able not to disappoint.
Last year it was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the kids have fun and the preparation is going well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future -
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about what kind of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of those interviewed by Nationwide say they have spoken with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% claim to have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation -
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: you can’t prepare your family to assist you if you don’t communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for costs.
Involve a financial consultant: he can advise you how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of a financing for long-term assistance may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid policy on life with ransom value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles upon your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you have not been able to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a procurator for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is brought urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
\"It's not just a matter of finances, but who the doctors are,\" Martin asks.
- What's the medicine?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event -
Man hit several times with an air rifle compressed in Ilfracombe

The victim, a forty-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a casual action.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in any danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a strong earthquake and a tsunami that on Friday struck the Indonesian city of Palu. The victims' budget is destined to rise.
Communications are interrupted and the rescue managers have not been able to have any information from Donggala's regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Sulawesi Centrale and, above all, the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 by killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the Pacific Firebelt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh to the north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of whom over half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the Western Sumatra province.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there have been no tsunamis but more than 100 people have died under the rubble.
2018: a strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia by killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested with the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of assault.
According to a statement issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped his phone off.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility centre and his security was set at $500, as reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared on Saturday and declared himself \"certainly innocent\"
Palin is liable to be charged with three first-degree crimes, i.e. detention for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also enrolled a second-degree criminal punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the court of Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the victims' budget is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media circulates videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
New York federal prosecutors are calling for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that since 1953 has never been committed for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a home depot rental van to rain on a cycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has intentionally killed the eight victims and equally, intentionally, inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both these counts can lead to the death sentence.
Week after the attack, a large federal jury issued 22 counts of charge to Saipov that included eight counts of murder with a criminal association, generally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for - a real planning and premeditation - said the prosecutors describing how Saipov brought it to an end as -atroce, cruel and depraved -
The preliminary notification states that “Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the South District of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man quoted in trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The death sentence was carried out for the last time in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminate for having passed information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The spouses Rosenberg both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that the investigators took pride in what they did.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As regards the 22 accounts, it was found not to be guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was, of course, disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
\"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accepting a conviction of guilt and condemnation of the ergastrole without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,\" Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of the Tory parliament states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the negotiations of Brexit
Nigel Farage today swore to \"mobilize the popular army\" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the Parliament of Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should - feel the pressure - of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom - would be already outside Europe - should Farage be the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges May must face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been highlighted by the Tory in favour of staying in Europe who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, of those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the \"caos\"
At the start of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting the negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
\"We would be out of Europe by now,\" he said.
The member of the Parliament Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: \"We have not fought world wars to serve them.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country -
Bone rejected the views that public opinion would change since the vote in 2016: \"The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false\"
Even MP Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, took part in the procession and said to the journalists: \"I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote on it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and of our activists who travel the streets to hunt for votes to allow us to be elected.
Let us lose the Chequers Plan and start listening -
In an incisive message for May he added: \"The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises\"
At the committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to “feel pressure” if they intended to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't allow it.\"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: \"I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom -
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before having a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against the Brexit flags after the group's formation this weekend.
The laburist risked the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for unattractive borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a hoax.
A good Brexit does not exist - it has concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she will seriously think if she succeeds in the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that Trump could challenge in 2020 was already in the air for some time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a town assembly since Trump settled.
One participant asked if he would qualify for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to settle the government, which means that a woman will take over the highest office.

Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after winning Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team’s orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of companion Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the Mercedes team's orders would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group tail traffic, which could be decisive.
The Mercedes stops the next round by returning to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, overcomes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which Ferrari's pilot tries to prevent their passage inside by risking to end up outside after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then drive the race for most of the race without stopping at the boxes for the rubber change and try to quickly finish to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by conquering the fourth place.
In the end, however, it must perform the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 laps it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to get me through.
The team did an exceptional job to conquer the first and second positions, said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language
On a commission held on Saturday, President Donald Trump joked Senator Dianne Feinstein about her insistence on not revealing the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony made by Ford in front of the Judicial Committee Senate, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are \"meschines, bad people and liars\"
\"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, bad and lying,\" he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being broadcast and the perpetrators say “Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't -
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't - he added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is trampled by his office.
\"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal her story,\" Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
\"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did it.\"
But his disclaimer is not credible for the president, who said during the Saturday evening session: \"I tell you, this is just a bad example of the body's language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen -
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that Democrats be using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the badness. They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control, said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.

Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the bet before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the lead for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe that Friday night in Belfast had reassembled and won the game with the Dundees for 2-1.

The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five meetings, will play the next home match in Milton Keynes Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after being killed to allow an aircraft carrying hundreds of people to take them off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been scattered because of a strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong settling shocks continue to interest the area and many are trapped among the maceries in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the 29th-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu, which was oscillating fearlessly.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought it was to collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
\"It's really sad news for us,\" he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims will reach the thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency will indicate that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the mills and it has been impossible to reach many others” explains the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
High waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where Sunday a mass burial will be carried out.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and living.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse -
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: \"I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
You are ready - as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a disperse after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a dispersed one.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger misses the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age or nationality.
The local boats made it possible to safely pull the other passengers and crew after the incident occurred while the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline states that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is not yet clear.
The U.S. airline and navy claim that the plane has crashed into the lagoon because it has not reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very low share.
\"Ed was really a fortune,\" Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that was coming to life, managed to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to set up a bridge have provided help using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the plane went down in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in incidents of aircraft registered with PNG but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
On Saturday, the presentation of evidence of the prosecution in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 20th century accused Quinton Tellis and the victim of the 19th year Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he recovered the localization data from several mobile phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that that day was not in town.
When the public prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that night was in Sanford's truck, the latter confirmed that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville -
Another inconsistencies is the fact that Tellis said he'd known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
Cellular data indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
\"He deleted it from his life,\" Hale said.
The defence will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge shall provide that the judgment shall be brought before the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting in its own songs positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed Group argues that hip-hop has gone away from its origins when it broadcasts political messages and denounces social problems.
Instead they want to go back to the origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently come back to boom in the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York father cites a court-martial for firing her with a \"racist\" text
In New York a father quoted a couple in court for dismissing her in a discriminatory way after he misreceived a text in which the mother complained that she was - another black -
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a real \"extortion\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he found out that the new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER NERA” wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice for a couple of times.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, who was embarrassed, fired Ms. Maurice, saying that she was not happy with their previous father, an African American, and that a Filipino was expected.
She paid Miss Maurice for her day at work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple on trial and, to be dismissed, asked for compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she had been initially hired, even if without a contract.
\"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this,\" he said on Friday to the Post adding, \"I know it's a discrimination.\"
The couple responded to the charge of racism by stating that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people - said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
“Will you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so.
Comparing the request to a true \"stortion\" - Plasco said that his wife has been in a very difficult situation for just two months.
\"You can't hang with a person like this.
It's not a very nice behavior - he added the financial advisor.
While the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by harshly criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter as follows: \"It is not easy to put herself in the shoes of the first-time reader of the book before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success gained by Paddington -
I say that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a little 'despite' after his death last year.
About Paddington, who you describe as a very important member of our family, adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” she says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like he had a son who reached a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not yours.
I think he would interpret Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself -
I had to say goodbye to my daughter on the phone that she was dying.
At the landing the daughter was transported urgently to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
\"Nothing has called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not have done it,\" Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse says.
\"Well, he called me to tell me that he was gonna die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly improving.
She died a little while earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to myself.
In the end Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, pained by the loss of her daughter, came aboard the plane with the other passengers who were unaware of what was happening to her.
\"No one knew that,\" he says.
\"For all the time I've done nothing but cry low-headed.\"
It's hard to explain, but while on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Tickets of two pained women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
\"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,\" she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
\"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said he lit every room he came in.
But before he died he left his job because the depression had brought him to a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says: \"I continue to fear that there will be a chain effect\"
He created tickets - to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak.
The Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
\"You never said he felt down or depressed,\" he says.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, it avoided looking at them in the eyes.
He says that his death was an enormous trauma that they had to develop: \"He lacerated the family.
He broke us.
But we had to go ahead and fight -

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigations
\"I think if we could proceed as you asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement,\" said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission was - losing calm because of the blockade of the root supporters.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left at the mid-term elections on 6 November. If the Republicans as predicted will achieve a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they chose for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him he met with Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the doubt and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea - is decreasing - with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un rose to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data from the Ministry of South Korean Unification, states that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates you ask from those who illegally bring out these people.
Pyongyang did not issue public statements.
To the vast majority of the refugees in North Korea in the end, South Korean citizenship is offered.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) heavily protected between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, are significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearisation which are in a state of shock.
This after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the United States' sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
\"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first,\" said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as \"sterical\" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi defines the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as \"sterical\" and states that it is not characteristically suitable to cover this task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think that if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” said Pelosi about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate’s judicial committee.
She visibly excited Kavanaugh denied the accusation of having sexually molested Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in a rush to emotion, so much so that he almost got to scream and with his throat tight from the crying while talking about his family and years at the high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee who called the charges against him a \"disgusting and coordinated defamatory campaign\" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown that he is being prevented from the Democrats.
“I think he has self-excluded himself with his statements and the way he spoke about the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in the state of charge in case it was confirmed and if the Democrats were to reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but even for the court that now presides,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh circumvented his claims on his intention to overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that, \"You cannot send a hysterical and party to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way\"
And women have to use it.
It's a right diatrix, months and years of angry attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
\"We cry when we get angry\" Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's weird, and you\"
And she went on, \"A woman who was leading somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, \"You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.
And so he continued.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea.
Tears are tolerated as a vent of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once started crying for an access to anger. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from which I was always slightly terrified took me for the neck and dragged me along the stairs.
\"Never show you how to cry,\" he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're punching you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run to the presidents.
In 1987, when Hart's extra-marital relationship was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business, which had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to apply for the presidency.
\"In fact, it wasn't a well-weighted decision,\" he said, laughing at us over 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and there was definitely no need for another one.
Someone defined them as ‘Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs’ —
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and swore that she would not apply if she had not collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause on the way out.
He found that some of the supporters who had given men $1,000 would only give her 250.
\"They think I can get a discount,\" he asked.
When he held the speech to announce that he would not have launched an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that it made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was victim), that he was moved.
\"It seemed like you were in the grip of a nerve collapse,\" Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
\"Someone could have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would have written on my tombstone.
Maybe -I think a lot - -
How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening blows of the trade war between the USA and China were fragrant and, while the battle is still over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant scaling took place this week with the new duties on articles for more than 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing reacted each time with measures of the same kind by applying duties from five to ten percent on 60 billion US dollars.
China has promised to respond to the US hit and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon march back.
Because Washington resigns, it would be necessary to give in to his demands, but publicly folding in the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can positively affect China over the long period of time by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
\"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than has been recognized so far,\" says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security Research Center.
Syria is - ready - for the return of refugees, supports the foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for the return of the refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
\"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept any conditional aid from those countries which supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The USA has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points that were needed to beat the United States.
The USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot in the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his shifts becoming one of the four players of always having to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in Thorbjorn Olesen ranking of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight of them, became the European player who won more in the tournament history with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution - he said an exciting Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his brother-in-law John Ram who beat the U.S. Tiger Woods golf legend with the score of 2&1 on Sundays.
\"If I think I grew up watching his meetings, I'm really proud that I beat Tiger Woods,\" said twenty-eight-year Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the score of his meetings in the Ryder Cup amounted to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 bets.
A strange statistic if you think you are one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: \"I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the European team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I will work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we will move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all away.
But they've played better than us.
