What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor any pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new colleagues from the ODS.
Current.cz daily testified to the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, i.e., if they know the arguôt that was born in the last few years at the city hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition that led to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream started during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the new elect do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say it.
- Who is Valdemort -
\"I really don't know.\"
“I’m a youth in pragoese politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected culture to test the speaker’s vocabulary”
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina responded in the same way.
For example, the sense of “golf pit”
\"That's the only expression you're proposing me to use.\"
Otherwise, I don't use the bow.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the ODS Pre-Electral Congress, the editorial chose 6 examples, in priority those that are related to the city of Prague.
Socialists were to explain the meaning of \"Voldemort - - the biggest golf hole in Prague - going to the pastry - - beef neerf - - betrayal of the capital - and - entler -
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek also refused the test.
\"I do not care about all these things and how the representatives of the citizen democracy are enjoying themselves: I will not give my opinion\"
“I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other in our programs,” he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
\"Voldemort\" says nothing to a'Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is - the biggest golf hole in Prague -
\"It's the Blanka tunnel,\" Kaucky said, adding immediately: \"But I know about the newspapers.\"
\"I'm going to have to pay myself a language course,\" he said.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental elite, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of going to the pastry -
\"I think it's about going to a company - Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of the companies in Janousek.
On the same Brezina reminds us that he takes his knowledge rather from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexicon of argot in social democracy.
\"I've taken advice with colleagues and it turns out we don't really have something like this.\"
\"The names are said to be once we use abbreviations and symbols,\" said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrat Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
\"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues are calling me like that,\" says Karel Brezina, \"about nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party sponsoring, is nicknamed the little jojoo-
The nicknames are also the only ones who admit to using social-democrats inside the party.
Hulinsky does not seem to like to hear Hulda very much, but Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Pragois president.
\"Doctor in Matraque Law\" he recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctor's degree in JUDr Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of \"sorcers\" has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared as witches have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
\"Man rarely has this destiny.\"
“You also do not judge healthy young women because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister in the capital of that country of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual social measure.
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunt.
The case involves a level playing field
\"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso are not able to read,\" said Die Standard about the drawback of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with the oil they had sprinkled with her.
The BBC server sent this information.
Criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used by the ritual onion was ignited by the woman's contact.
The oil flamed, it seemed, when the team wanted to - hunt down the evil spirit - of the woman.
The isolation of workers is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: \"Human-spirited eaters have always been a danger,\" he said.
As Burkina Faso seeks to reduce witch hunt, the Gambia did not later than last year saw the President himself participate in it.
\"The Gambin President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for the witches who, apparently, would have participated in his death and had worked hard by the black magic to kill the President as well\"
\"From nearby Guineans to the rescue, they brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, men and women randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia,\" said the organization \"Amnesty International.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released on international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The chairs warm, he signed a higher rent.
An old man who was an imposing man came out of the door of the customer centre of the RPG Byty of the coal barron - Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arms a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who came to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
“And there is no hot water and heating works in solid fuel - it shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
\"But I signed it anyway,\" he said, \"and half-resented.
The Citizens' Association of BytyOKD.cz apartments which has described the new rental conditions as “immoral and indecent” advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of hand.
\"One says that, the other says something else - by snoring the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the price of the market.
Aktualne.cz has decided to visit the ‘laboratory’ personally for this reason.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, -book 2011 - is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number -157 - that your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about rent, but new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - request for reparations, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44000 RPG portfolio apartments have collected mails with new lease contracts in their letter box since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
\"It has been working for nearly a week, so it's still under test,\" he responds, after a moment of hesitation, to the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and old minor apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats made a fairly sustained statement before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
\"20 years after them, I want a new floor\"
\"They didn't even change me a pon...n board in the wc, relieves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is primarily, according to employees, pensioners who come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a return of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the Havirovaska Street’s deregulation window is not really overwhelmed by the questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it,” says the employee at the desk.
And yet RPG posses both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'They are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says RPG on its website.
“This person will not go to court,” thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the customer center gives him reason.
\"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court,\" he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
\"We'll see\"
\"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait,\" she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
“And, moreover, current rents still fail to meet the level required for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung at the ceiling in front of the padded armchairs of the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and covers no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments -
\"And it will always be at least 7.50 Czech crowns the m2 per month,\" says the screen.
The increase of 38 per cent concerns only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
In these cases, this is an increase of a very low sum of 19.66 Czech krona to m2 - adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (cf. the staple) is made to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected him to also house a mini kindergarten with everything he needed - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children can become employees of Arch. design.
The company of architectural projects Arch. Design., whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of child-making, and it was important for architects and project leaders to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with time contracts reduced, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It is the employees of Arch.Design.They themselves have imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they have been able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini maternity school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding facilities (up to 2.8 thousand Czech krona), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the two-year funding facility, the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the maternal mini school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher care for children all day. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three for most.
As a \"Ministry of Mother School\" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard for the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the programme of the mini-school is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children don't just play it, but quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go look for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stairway to a vertebral column of dinosaurs and balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname House in bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, here is all that is ypic for Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasing colours and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought precisely.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the frames of windows, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the lamps.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in Passeig de Gracia shopping street by number. 43, was born of the construction of a 1877 house of architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building a new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multiple dwelling house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that decorations are given for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises have nicknamed the house hot right after its completion because of its organic forms - the House in the bone -
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it the house that dances -
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines and did not allow itself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of construction stack on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo asked for (and got satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third one bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase that allows access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space liaison.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with light shafts.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was registered in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund may be visited by each one.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and they extended the field of visits to common spaces and at the barn, including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket in the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20% discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a pillow: women have other criteria than men.
No hostage frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so mattress and top give a real base for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the upper are to be placed is also important.
Typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses do not sleep continuously are not appropriate because they are \"heating\" softly.
They have, moreover, greater weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. From mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad, where very thick mattresses are often used with a soothing layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
\"That's how all the hockey players who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there.\"
\"For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattresses with a bumpy layer of parsley foam\"
“These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore take misinformation from joints and skin,” says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in padded furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
\"Today everything is going well, Tempor, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy moss.
What a \"miracle\" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses on you and you won't come back in the night like after a tough game.
You're just getting better sleep.
The parsley foam also works as a protection against squars.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Mater-Materials and Decorators who have spent several years devoting themselves to the problem of a healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own dressing and mattresses, so be careful, however, during the bait to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the top to different heights and it is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, which count for the layer of shape and air at least three centimeters.
\"To touch or to sit on the mattress you must not feel the springs - warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type to sleep.
The sleeper bed, when the mattress and the top are united like sumptuous sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; you must not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it's clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a big (and capped) tamis.
To this end, specialists refuse to make a 25-year claim for a mattress or life assurance.
But all to his but.
And for this reason an expert advice from the vendors: for a 120/140cm mattress, quit, for mattress coating, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to manufacture slide closure coatings for the whole, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and washing machine size it is very important!) or handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a closet?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bags springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-positioned laminers with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Along with the adjustment of the rigidity of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special link of the blades that allows pressure to even tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper - is integrated - well.
For men who have -the shoulders as wide as the back - this is really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the matelas manufacturers who for the \"masculine\" started using a rammolling area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them again a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer, there are wing or plate tops with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and causes tension.
But, of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen of air) on good mattresses and plummet, the \"plus\" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians per example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the upper or the rammollie area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and weed based.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
“The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products” explains Petr Vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While extracting birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, \"refroids - man, coatings - warms - women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are considered as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached its first place.
Saving for mattress and sommy is not simple.
From time to time, it may be possible to have in the framework of special actions by manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of only one.
As for example the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam memory stitched to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The era of parsley or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempor material at a -cosmic rhythm -
This started as a material for NASA because astronauts were undergoing the start of huge load factors.
The Tempor is softened by heat and stiffened, on the contrary, by cold.
So it adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use either the EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Apparatus to follow people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child causes more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, put in place at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as by example that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to protect their children better.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
\"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,\" says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
\"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases\"
“Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose the box is used and how to use it in case of an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to bring something like this to him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
“Portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
\"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to make sure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it.\"
\"Now it's the phone.\"
\"As soon as the tracking equipment develops, they (criminals) will also look for it as the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign\"
“In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police,” said the psychologist.
It acknowledges that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, he says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an aggression.
‘The device may be set up in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a specified period of time.’
‘In case the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains the same.’
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an elongated position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, smartphones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer comparable service after having formed it with a special prologic.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the one carried on the pendant of the size of an allumette box or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
‘This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracer’
\"Or it will come to light after some time, which will have given the police a little more time,\" he added.
Whether the tracer is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of one-position acquisition systems using the GPS (which is commonly used as self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could take the turn of the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km of the property.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army has purchased offensive cords from the company known as STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as the reason for the collection of an enormous amount of cordeaux detonating to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual explosive exercise.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army, are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
That distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could be provided for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to have more than 2 m of offensive cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the rapid response brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
\"And I don't take my head if they buy a lot of disgusting cords in our house.\"
\"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing.\"
“For us the army is a good customer that we strive to be content,” says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of ropes are being destroyed by the fact that the army will have these \"munitions\" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reported only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army of only two years.
\"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it may even go up to four years,\" said a two who do not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The last lifespan, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a rebate due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
\"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's supply of 245 km,\" says the spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the opinion of the prosecutors of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the offensive cords of the police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the security of pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to obtain more flexiblely the more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army strong of two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, head over the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old revelry cords that it buys today - at a cheap price -
Until now I have benefited from the contacts I have made through the competitions.
The frank sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to the winning place of the contest of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur's competition for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something,” said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building he turns into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he had another one of the same quality.
\"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the freeness of Pytloun hotels have been shown - the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
“And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well,” Pytloun adds with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I have to say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition for all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge to date that he could not have obtained otherwise.
\"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain commercial relations regularly.
According to him, success-related fame also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
\"I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has generally been recognized\"
\"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work for all of us together.
\"Only my name is pushed forward,\" said Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphory of victory was sharply replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind himself.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the year's Firm competition organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a business firm of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me and my collaborators and has increased our confidence to fight competition,' says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a society with some friends in his father's vicinity for the manufacture of plastic bathers.
Not long after they started to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was also known in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were working with a company that had the greatest success in their country of origin,” said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not passed to Farmet only in the euphories of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 economic results and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their acquisitions of new materials and technologies.
“We obviously did not escape this situation”
“Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even the licensor,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
\"We have built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the presentation of society in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions,\" says Zdarsky.
It all leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of assurance also go back and with them the number of employees.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that suppresses foolish regulations.
The survey of the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Certain absurd regulations may have been deleted.
The little-glorious winner of this year's survey on the absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that employees can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration asked for a paper excerpt from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
\"Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract of the Trade Register for Insurance Payment Controls,\" said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To point out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfil in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition from the absurdity of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If the last year 3000 voters showed up, it was at least 4000 this year that they gave their vote.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, what is more, more and more.
\"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world,\" says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, i.e. 8 places more than last year.
The year's Absurdity competition was first established in 2006 and continues annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the end of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the “antiprix” and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the highest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, it is about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the \"finalists\" of the competition, for example, there is a requirement that highway and track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees identify two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins in early November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a happening that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culminating moment of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts canons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today make the company complicated - Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade, said.
The effort to remove absurd decrements is not a blow to the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the individual company to the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And it's all right until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the decline for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was abolished.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Firm Responsible.
The objective of this competition is to support the company in a reasonable and fair manner.
\"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity,\" says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 firm's competition organised by Vodaphone, companies that do not have any success with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and forecast activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Of the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic, there is no example of the company of pragmatic and Netera prologics that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the largest contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In caring for employees with health problems, it can also be mentioned The old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent and, for this, has obtained the title of the firm Responsible for the Central Bohemia region and who has placed third in the region in the Vodaphone's Firm's competition for the year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, reduced wages.
The jury also released the title because it is a priority for Czech manufacturers, supports a ditonous activity in the immediate vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment,” explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the responsible company IT Hosted the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and set them up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their home work and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
\"We also support the foundation Man in the shade that helps the local Roma community,\" said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the latest, there is also a company for washing and cleaning the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
\"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure,\" said Joseph Strapac of the construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and had sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
The poorly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
\"If the representatives of the firms in law had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the contest \"principal\" Vodaphone's Year Firm -
“Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year,” says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Terrestrial Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Terrestrial Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and trading in real estate Lubos. G.
It had endeavoured to handle a call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
“For the moment I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for an initiation offence in the context of a call for tenders and a public contest,” said Pravo newspaper chief of Plzen Antonie Zelena’s Procuratorate, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations as the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor at the end of 24 hours.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, one can only speculate on the basis of so little official information.
On a question of Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund indicated that the police had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
\"It was a customer and in no case an employee, it has specified.
Cerna's public competition has as its real name - the call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act - and is in place when several legal candidates manifest themselves.
\"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to repose, which must be settled before the value of the land is announced.\"
\"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the purchasers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights,\" explained the spokesperson for the Fund.
Lubos G. had, of course, information about the persons who had registered in the appeal and since he himself was also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of restitution rights, he had offered the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in charge of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had connections far above the FdT (Funds des Terrains) standards.
He was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for having published lands for which the decision to set up a building had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he traded it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could put construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 crowns per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and certain locations rents will also increase.
From January, families will have to remove from their purse up to 100 crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, nearly 2 percent more expensive gas, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to occur for households in the apartment the 100 crowns annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but, of course, when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count about 100 more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating varies from city to city.
They are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for the central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the residents of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragosis will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand rental apartments starting in January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company that owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children sauté in rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts smoothly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the recidivism hospital are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
\"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be salty\"
'The trend is really strong in alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of the Hospital of Horovice in Central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle of papa into the closet, it’s sometimes wisky but it’s the fernet and vodka that prevails.
\"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it,\" explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
\"In general, it's rum or fernet.\"
\"It is today fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools\"
“In some cases, it was slivovice that they returned from the house,” Jurinova added.
According to the Head of the Pélikan Department, seeing children aged 13 to 14 years at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he was just ten years old in pediatrics where ambulances brought large schools around completely drunk.
“A young girl was hospitalized four times.
“She began her 12-year career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with ecstasy, described this particularly important case.
\"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party\"
\"What's interesting is, it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours,\" said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their tolerance out of the ordinary that their rejection of drinking is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
\"Under the alcoholic vocabulary, there is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it, but that is not found in children.\"
“For those who use the replaying alcohol, it is rather a socio-family background that is significantly unfavorable,” said the Head of the Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesperson, approximately forty ivre children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic at Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the STASTISTICS.
Ivy children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he excites according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
- Either they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of vacations -
\"Of course I lived on the day of the witches a admission of 7 drunk children all at once,\" said Pelikan.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in medically controlled detoxification is paradoxically better off than the one who came home and suffered the next day from the \"wood mouth\"
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
\"They are for this better lottis since they spend an excellent evening then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them\"
\"They are only amazed at where they are,\" says Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
\"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their ivy cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay one evening,\" Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, who should recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not address the cases of Hebrew children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer sits.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the bi-site versions of the L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of L-159.
They are now stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's Press Department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
'The L-159 monoplaces planned for the exchange were taken on long-storied aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
“The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state,” Pravo Pejsek said.
He added that the army will not remain without biplace as the department signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces unused into two bi-places.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introduce aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance's countries.
\"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one taking the aircraft L-159 into account is EADS and that they will be used to train the pilots of NATO member countries\"
\"It is therefore the case of the one who considers how to achieve this,\" Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the Defence Directorate argued that the exchange provides a future export from L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24, which wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice as the aircraft should have been selected in the context of a call for tenders at European level and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone the testosterone.
Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before 60 years old - proclaimed the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, especially by combining with genetic risk or other factors such as family health history, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the annuller.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longest index than the yearbook, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone matches a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him, it seems, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is \"completely demonstrated\"
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechia like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, the bleachers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 flight to Brno in the direction of Prague has the same fate.
The Central Automobile Club (UAMK) disbanded him to the information
At the 91st mile [91 km] a truck was hit, at the 93rd heavy weight, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on highway D1 at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go to Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A bunch of cars several kilometers have formed in this place.
Also on highway D11, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines, for example, are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramways are delayed, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Paz (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's crisis staff must meet again.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
Czech Railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 rapid links.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but redoubled in vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impracticable, on the Brno road there are beginning to be snowflakes and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass some communications routes to the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them up, it may take to send snow-sleeved and strawberries.
We can't for the time being estimate when they're rolling.
On Hodonin's road, caution is needed in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is also a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warning CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two to ten centimetres of snow; it fell the most in Northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimetres of snow.
The drowning was gradually disappearing in Czechia.
Americans have a smart new weapon.
The U.S. Army sent in Afghanistan a new, intelligent weapon known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and - it will change the game - for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm gauge ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a high breaking explosive, works in fact as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So we can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a rift.
Nor is it protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel sparks, it can put it out of battle as well.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses the technology - intelligent -
“The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects his intended site and supports the relaxation.
“Whenever you’ve reached 543 meters”
“When you press the relax, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters plus or less 1, 2, 3 meters, said Audette.
400 delocalized jobs
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their place of work currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, the group is expected to include 100 other jobs that are still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: \"Frankurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure\"
He claims that the connection at the airport is of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major enterprise within the region has generated the joy of the winners and caused the loss of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a \"planetary actor\" had been conquered.
It is a \"extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment\"
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
\"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company,\" said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties in dealing with the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about preventing such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
- I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative -
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighboring vertical little girl, as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, was part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the city hotel. It raises numerous criticisms, not only because of the impressive development of the areas that used to be used in part parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Specialized Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest provider of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For that, 7000 square meters of rental took place in the Astro Park building.
This old twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Menaces v. Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is becoming increasingly difficult.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in revealing confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with more and more force.
The cyber-activists group - Wikileaks - no longer has access to its host so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
‘Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server —
“Freedom of expression in the country of freedom” reported cyber activists at the origin of revelations on Wednesday (local time) via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the highest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: \"Formable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe\"
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, -they should stop selling books -
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, \"The Guardian\"
\"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information,\" said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
\"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, putting our national security at risk and at risk of life all over the world,\" according to an independent senator's statement.
\"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.\"
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper - The Independent - the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described the prosecution of Sweden as orchestrated intrigues by its detractors.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were made against the site.
\"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange\"
That's why Assange was particularly worried about her safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government advisor Mr. stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should - be killed - and that Mr. Obama could - use a Drone -
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the American President, Mr. Barack Obama, described him as a \"ridiculum and absurdity,\" the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed himself to spy activities.
\"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of a website-owner individual,\" says Mr. Gibbs.
\"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website\"
The U.S. government now completely passes the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr. Travers was tasked with setting up the necessary structural reforms, which were made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
\"We have done everything to get in touch with them,\" said the Department of State spokesperson Philip Crowley.
\"We are ready to protect them if necessary.\"
The University of Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confistors are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e., in German, the ice confisor somewhat defunct, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice cannot avoid the Italian Carpigiani company, Gelato-University.
The sorbetières manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams released from its machines respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extend over several days. Also, practical sessions are held in the private glacier.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California, is a member of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose in the future a quality European product in the country of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and she wants, after a few years, to draw a few unique things from this trying job for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ices.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: \"The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance\"
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats all 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it casts a pasteurized white cream, foundation of all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately assailli of question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
He who only speaks of ices - made from natural ingredients - may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is of course possible to manufacture ice without using stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not crouch anything other than ice granules.
Certain modifications to the basic mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients you buy in the fruit or jams of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
-the suppliers will all try to reflect you dozens of flavoured ingredients -
\"However, you should just try.\"
Be in fruit sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Be in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added of cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course have to move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ices are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The nut ice does not necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it is made up of a large part of nuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture properly meets the taste of a ice,” Luciano says.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if we use peach purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (the vines are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as ever.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously beaten available to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, small panels are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo gossips about the fruit of the head to the feet and, thus, bursts his fellow students when the control of the colossal blender bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that such an incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time -
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experiencing the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
\"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed,\" said M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the president of the Ecsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts, are under contract with the Ilisi pressure group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked decisively on the development of the Ecsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and was therefore clearly in conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond textually to the position taken by the Ilisi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in the background, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking head of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed the camp.
Just a short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those in the industry, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (International Life Sciences Institute).
This body considers itself a neutral forum that brings together experts from, among other things, the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
\"We would like to know, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize on the field,\" said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
\"If you don't look at the risks, how can you discover them?\" asks Mr. Then about an accusator tone.
That's also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that the industry was monitoring safety research.
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell searched for it, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in a halt to the construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
A few fragments were obtained.
\"These stones are relics\"
\"They must not disappear\"
It declares with enthusiasm: \"A modest and cheap, simple and terrestrial rock\"
He claimed that by cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with this fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former deposit of munitions of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
\"This would be a shame if they were concave or if they disappeared in the dump,\" he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallepipede weighing an average of 80 kilograms of value between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to do so during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still embedded in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the safe and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into \"Mäuerle\" or weed-bands limitations.
\"In fact, this stone is nothing special,\" said Mr. Rongen.
-in the summer this political component -
He enters his car all the land, turns his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied the law he had abandoned, and later he began studying biology before he became interested in computer science and eventually became a career worker.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He had treasured himself all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He looks back.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
\"Sometimes they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden\"
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says with enthusiasm.
‘My favourite stone —
It takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a bunch of fingers: Red sand stone, formerly part of Karlsruhe's station.
And so on.
‘Joli travertine
The parallelepipede was already part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertin from the police prefectures, the red granite from St Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from Heilbronn Hospital.
What a work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once hand-sculpted and moved with simple levers and carts drawn by oxen, he becomes entirely respectful.
\"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into play\"
He didn't become rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
\"We work hard, but it's rewarding,\" says the waste recycling company.
Next time, he'll have to go to Cologne.
There too are stones to save.
Skills struggle to conquer high potentials
The counter knows a living outflow.
16 students are bouncing to buy small salmon, tomato sauce and white-eating bread.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of contest of ideas, they need to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to deny better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in amphitheaters before they arrive on the job market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performances, they try to identify the outstanding talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the car group beloved the talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards featuring Volkswagen's logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's environment.
Nico Selle from the technical university of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: -Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience -
\"As for the Volkswagen group, he can meet the students, look closer to the serious candidates, and appreciate those who come into the account as a collaborator.\"
According to Mr Sele, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
\"At times, the focus was on the professional project,\" said Mr.Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much stronger.
In sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a kyrielle of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all court the hand of highly qualified work.
These are mainly graduates from engineering channels who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German VDI engineers' association, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will be further expanded.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and advisory expertise.
It organizes expensive events aimed at the recruitment of talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of paper rally where competitors must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
\"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race\"
\"For us, a simple cruise was too little of a thing.\"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
\"To date, we have remained in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action\"
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to send their requests to our company soon,” he says.
Apart from the direct avoidance on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
\"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional trade fairs\"
\"For example, at the solar technology fair,\" says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of recovery.
Currently, 35 posts are put in competition on the company's website.
\"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant posts\"
\"This costs money and takes a lot of time,\" he said.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
“Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his or her final study project at home”
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to make its advertising by displaying other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
\"Of course, a large group can't do that,\" said Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money no longer plays the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or opportunities for promotion are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual table of honor for German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The head of staff Mrs Stübe hopes that this placement will make it possible to enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
\"I think that candidates refer mainly to external evaluations with respect to a potential employer,\" she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
\"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees,\" he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
- Satisfied collaborators form the best messengers -
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
\"It's like playing in an orchestra,\" said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeastern United States, in the years to come.
The Washington Government passed a ban on an equivalent ban and thus definitively annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling has been banned for the time being.
The Secretary to the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is the source of this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its current conclusions December.
In October, the secretary at the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the platform exploded.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security controls, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches from the gas and oil groups.
The actors in this business sector are now publicly warning that the supply flow rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it is so far.
\"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector - according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, prior to the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: \"No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.\"
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it smells similar to that in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
\"Don't exhaust yourself,\" the environmental activist threw the journalists to calm them down: \"You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens.\"
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man deep in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat trail around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It is impossible to see that the basement is covered by brown crude oil mats.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that, once, she was collecting shrimp with whole seals here.
In the meantime, however, the calm waters were completely silent.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen live in the small town near Bodo now need to collect for six hours to reach fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the pests jumps to the eyes when crossing the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat smelts out some cradinous brown water. Whoever takes it out of its hand removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangrove emerge from the soil as slippery sticks. The isolated palm trees leave sadly hanging their palms.
We seek in vain the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in the wetlands: Since the engine off-board stops, a fantastic silence falls on this paradise once and for all that resembles a station-servicing by the smell it exudes.
\"What is happening here is war against the environment,\" said Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: \"Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard.\"
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a battlefield for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered this area; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this society: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexplored, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters are built in the water of steel truffles as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are referred to as very affectionately - Christmas trees.
They are up to 50 years old, most are crushed by corrosion to the point.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time into piece, as a constant fleet of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed in the sea during the accident of the super-oiler - Exxon Valdez - 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who must bear the responsibility for continued environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the U.S. researcher Richard Steiner opposed the Shell group to applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conduct failures is - even higher than other -
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many tunnels that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
We heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of kerosene drops fall and you finally get diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators daily produce four 300-litre Diesel drums: \"It brings us 34,000 Naira - about 22 dollars.
The Delta people take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material for free.
It is offered by the 'protectors', which are putting the oil pipeline network everywhere across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include members of high-ranking politicians and military, load the lion's share in tanks and bradent in the world market.
The Akpobari activist believes that the debate on whether environmental disaster or rather subversive activities are to be attributed to the population or to the mode of laxist production is purely academic.
\"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage nor illegal theft and refinery.\"
But, in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni mainly towards Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group. \"Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better\"
So Michael gets nervous.
\"It's a long time for you to get rid of - announces the robust oil worker.
- Soldiers may appear at any time
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material as all Nigerians.
\"In any case, this damn thing has caused our country to fall very low,\" says Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to a catastrophic failure of the reactor.
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, airbus passengers from the company Quantas had so far seen more chance: During its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices presented a serious safety problem, and cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leakages in connection with the oil pipeline, indicated in a position published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a \"catastrophic failure of reactors\"
Reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce are concerned and equip 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
The airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian Federal Court, which is based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts have been detached and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, indicated the spokesperson for the ASB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa replaced, by precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the world's largest airliner.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
All of Germany covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany hail: By glacial temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they could not escape the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent raffles swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects seafarers to take place on its Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowflakes on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Meteomedia bad weather warning plant announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, there fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind resulted in an interruption of traffic and caused by plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious rail disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees on the railways, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snowwinds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in many flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesperson indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service and provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car toned on a slippery slope in Aschafenburg.
However, meteorologists tell good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will twist in case of light raspberries.
But the wind's going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per location.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The debt bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could account for up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group's seat: The twin towers in the Business Quarter have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper - Financial Times Deutschland - cites a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the intended sale.
He said - we will check whether it is more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them ourselves, and to re-locate them later -
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin rounds for an amount of 272 million Euros from the holders of own funds, and they were then rehabilitated.
Energy optimization transformations have taken some EUR 200 million into account.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, which are renamed in the meantime - Green Towers - to around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying for the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the underage who were reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to lift the bodies because the security situation of the left pit continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age were buried under the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief teams were able to enter the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
Flagships were put in front of all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative feast that New Zealand had nurtured hope that minors would return to the surface.
\"But they never came home\"
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said that he could not refuse to accept the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative feast.
Minors of South African and British origin also became involved in the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are displaced, burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film, - Walhalla Rising - the opponent's epic.
To what audience could Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of it as turning - Walhalla Rising -?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is held captive; he releases himself from his bully and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in bad mood, he pulls out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be killed.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let, at most, at the turn of one or two sentences, some horrible agony screams.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the amazingly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decor of the Vikings universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is bad for them to be mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of \"Pusher - his trilogy regarding the drug dealer faroche and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to art and trial cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Amateurs of action films die of boredom, when the borgne embarks, for reasons which can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising, then, that “Wallalla Rising” did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of the poverty that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a fierce dream transformed into film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugrous soundtrack, but above all with an insatiable hatred that bruises the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully stands beside the borgne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything else, the bourgeois hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any case, rotten.
“Walhalla Rising” is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which has for its purpose the accommodation, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this, even less to submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubicly shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate; the largest nearby town is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built, it appears with the aid of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, in late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is little more information available than at the time, and even in time the mystery grew ever greater.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little clues showing that country was developing an active nuclear weapons program.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a \"suppressed reactor\" even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be \"pleasant\"
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned on how to ensure that a nuclear reactor is involved, a high-ranking diplomat from the United Nations only gave a laconic response in the summer by stating that the IAEA had sufficient documents to ask questions -
The Syrians have certainly promptly removed the debris from the \"unutilized military building\" and have proceeded to a meth of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images of commercial providers from a Member State showing the moment which followed the attack directly, and it appears that the latter are more evocative than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it unlikely.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of El Kibar and I refuse access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel has an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this issue.”
This is how the investigation of this case has drawn in length since June 2008 without a result being achieved and is increasingly becoming a serious problem of the Agency's credibility - as recognized by a high-level Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is ultimately a serious violation of the Nuclear-Weapon Treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a functional relationship with the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated what facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" they are known in the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as well as the names of neighbouring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located on or directly next to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access from the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent to the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by the U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallepipede to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could serve fuel production -
There would be no indications of sensitive activities such as enrichment and uranium reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the non-enriched uranium.
However, there are some plausible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been later separated.
It is unknown whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in all three sites.
When hundreds of land-loaded trucks are gone, no one will have any information on the place of storage of the gravel.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing the satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley, has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has undertaken grounding work on all three suspicious sites and has moved enormous containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but it has not helped to put aside suspicions.
He said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan on the inspections to be carried out, which was to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
During this time Damascus also ended this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the reactor's destruction, the emergency would not be reported in this case, for example, says Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been reporting for a few months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has, of course, already talked about an option to which I am open in the future - but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries that are represented there do not want to see the situation get to know a escalation.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who reflects: \"It would be useful if in the end they found nothing.\"
Love in Wartime
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause trouble.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian bull during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hassecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is the ambassador of good will of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
\"The meeting must be held in Bosnia,\" says Hassecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hassecic's organization had subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of a good-will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a screening authorization after a few hesitations in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has learned about the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What makes a big difference with the version \"a rape victim falls in love with his ass\"
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie puts it, is - unfair and based on wrong information -
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can give him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's pull new!
This evening, everything is going well again with the Irish.
No sign of dismay.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout for joy on the bottom of a loud music, they tripped feet.

Cyan Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer reserved, these two behaviors are not really going well together.
And yet, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the devastating question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not reflected in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
\"But I find a strange feeling,\" he says.
\"The home country is so far away and I don't have any jobs\"
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, -in less than two, she took off her job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign - said the young man smiling.
Because of the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chances abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and her brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon be leaving their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be an emigration stream comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed a great deal of ease, grief now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is mainly affecting well-trained young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: “In Ireland, everything goes to the draw”
\"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity goes away and our country is a whole generation.\"
\"The last one to leave extinguished the light\"
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future because the government only throws it into the eyes and offers no prospect of the future to young people.
\"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,\" says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her friends cramp from a practical internship not paid to another.
She states that they are her greatest concern is to emigration itself in four years.
\"It's a sad and depressing thought.\"
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the salon -WorkingAbroadExpo - which provides full support on the theme - working abroad -
\"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy,\" said the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a joke, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months now, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, because he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the credit that he has contracted to build his home in the country of birth.
\"The situation is already a little crazy,\" he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
\"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live practically no more\"
He bursts with a embarrassed laugh across the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive large-branded cars are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for a amount of 380,000 Euros, funded 100 percent by credit.
\"It was crazy times, no doubt, money was easy,\" he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, rests from the hot tea and says: \"I don't have children to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero\"
The engineer of the building does not like the complaints he has often heard in recent times.
\"No one should suffer from hunger, yet our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island,\" he said.
\"Working abroad for a while is not what can happen worse, perhaps that's what makes us feel first of all Irish.\"
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on”
This idea pleases Cyan Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is going elsewhere.
In his palm tree, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well these last days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell party.
\"Only, not much emotion,\" he said, drinking a long throat of beer.
\"A farewell, it seems quite disturbing.\"
\"Let's call it a good-bye evening, all relaxed, gathering some friends, with some drinks and some games\"
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey conducted in September and early October.
The first is the quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific in South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this was the same number as last year, but with a significant increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but they had a strong rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for democracy.
If this has been successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have had a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and declined again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared feeling of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America where recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or one of their loved ones have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, decreasing by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote.
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in the wilderness and plunged into fear.
Vote boxes and a new poll were presented, ballot papers scattered in droplets, looted polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations would open late at night.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, were mistaken in the vicinity to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, several of whom were alleged to have denounced fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as - a fairly good election in many ways -
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process -
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are due to René Préval, President of the People's Party, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The opposition's two candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their original appeal to make the vote invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support in voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second bull reaches the second round.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, we were afraid that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Almost 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this was her highest level since her election in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms.Fernández, obviously in mourning, that she would either abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation fell into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissenting members of the Peronist ruling movement joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian struck one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not have to approve the 2011 budget.
\"I'm not going to fight myself,\" said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and trade union wage claims are around 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which made counterfeit statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs. Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation eroded growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of seeking to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government entered into an agreement with the bonders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging forwards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it once sum $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that it could not involve supervision by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide a \"technical assistance\" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude to INDEC's sanitation.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which the Kirchnerism is highly prostrate.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have relived.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject many of her husband's policies without noise.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have been moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his great brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters were present on 27 November, 70 per cent of eligible individuals, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings in relation to the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but that's right.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has focused on the full independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential vote, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of Taiwanese elections, including busy country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal outfits.
An attempt to murder mysteriously required has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary President of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, just across his face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, has had consequences for the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates have played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its links with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from attracting anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation as to whether China's policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the bercail.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let us start with the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates came up under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate to the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party had a \"reliable alternative\" in relation to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite vertigo economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impoverishment seems to be largely due to unemployment and to the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says that his cabinet and his local antennas will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist - the point of no return has already passed -
Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category - best new artist -
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist handcuffed by President Obama to take place at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a great appointment in the category of the \"best new artist\" -
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, Esperanza, the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not go out more than three albums before the recording, which establishes the public identity of this artist.
Its ambitious album of 2010, \"Chamber Music Society,\" has certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skilled pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one sharp line at Spalding compared to the glowing success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Other than that, Grammy Awards voters rightly honoured \"Historicity\" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the category - instrumental album - a twist on a invigorating frisson of a recording that was one of the leading favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, \"Moody 4B\" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and \"Positootly\" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favoured by the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequently invited to \"Treme\" of HBO, has been honoured in the contemporary jazz category; it also leans heavily towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Arge, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognitions in the big class together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Children Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album \"Pathways\" of his octet's live was a great example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Award Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Awards annually include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
In the lead of the appointments, we quote \"Deus Ex Machina\" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five \"yes\" and \"Dreamhouse\" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three \"yes\"
Among those appointed with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, -Los Angeles - a work that was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year showcases five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No.3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; \"God Ex Machina\" and \"Metropolis Symphony\" by Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; \"Dreamhouse\" by Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; \"Sacrificium - the art of Castrati - featuring various artists; and the \"Requiem\" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the names are \"Lulu\" from Berg from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, \"Marc Antonio e Cleopatra\" from Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; \"The Love of Loin\" from Kaija Saariaho from the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; \"The Enchanted Wanderer\" by Rodion Shchedrin from the Orchestra and the Choeur du Théâtre Mariinsky; and \"Ivanhoé\" by Arthur Sullivan from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition have Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for -Deus Ex Machina - Hans Werner Henze for -Appassionally Plus - Magnus Lindberg for -Graffiti - and Shchedrin for -The Wanderer Enchanted -
Pärt's Symphony No.4 took its first place at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed \"Los Angeles\" and is dedicated to the former oil store Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The \"Mandolin Concerto\" by Dorman was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he soon wrote the work of 15 minutes especially for the interpreter at the mandolin Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
\"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms,\" Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the category of orchestral services, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, we quote pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist names: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic blends category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording-Racines: my life, my song-
The Temecula Mosque project wins approval from the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took part in the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it,” said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
\"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen.\"
\"This shows justice takes it away.\"
\"The opposition is really minimal,\" he added.
\"They just have very strong voices\"
\"We have good people in this valley\"
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at roughly equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal's website.
“There is no more America” wrote an intervener.
\"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand\"
- America is down -
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 occurred in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush reported violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has lived together without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a space bigger and better than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque at the Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of the Chaparral lycée.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
\"This body has a dual capacity.\"
\"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic\"
\"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly \"foreign\" way of life,\" commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
“We are wondering what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the area of research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery - indicates that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the \"standard\" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed - commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Spacial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
\"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,\" Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake as it has high levels of arsenic.
arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
\"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus\"
As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately.
\"But the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphor; it penetrates inside and somehow gums the work of our biochemical machine,\" Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic that it was able to adapt to and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said, so the researchers assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was formed at first, said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The two other four-flight exhibition dogs outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two pembroke gallois - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late in the evening Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
\"The good news is that dogs go well,\" Whitmore said.
- They're in good shape.
\"They were returned to their legitimate owners\"
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
\"An investigation is under way.\"
\"We don't want to say it.\" Whitmore said.
- We follow orders -
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month female - were healthy and excepted, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were wearing missing until they discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championship - AKC/Eukanuba - Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events scheduled in the days prior to the exhibition - AKC/Eukanuba - said Peek in Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and hold their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy boxer, a parson Russell terrier and a breton hanger - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, in the thickest fur, in the truck where it would be fresher.
They have a little open windows so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redo again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal New York bankruptcy judge officially leased the pre-packaged plan on Thursday by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the Thursday decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, no longer any legal obstacles remain before MGM to float under the supervision of the Spyglass Entertainment Founders, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an facilitated study.
Staff will be brought back to about 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has established a $500 million credit facility to finance the new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged to advise management on how to place its finance as it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, sale to auctions attracted few bidders among whom none of them were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more whose creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a $4 million \"premium of success.\"
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-launch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on -the Hobbit - with Warner Bros
The studio must make a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important gap in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumpstrings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys-R - Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known such, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys-R-Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toy toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine dance singing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-round games like Simon Says and can do moon dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who tried to play the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a back bag filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a ride into a session with self-correction and a valve classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, these are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for the 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses a iTunes-like system to offer electronic games and books and has an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks just larger than a lightbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impractical spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in toy shops are the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online company animal from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 -Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6-12 years old) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit from the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Lightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the last button-tailed micro-robots.
The fake beast quickly moves on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a Softer Side to Order Maintenance in China
Tang Shenbin was a city seat like an urban coaching sergeant, seriously inspecting his nerve loads, voiced orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - responsible for public order in China, feared and despised for arbitrary repression and for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
\"You are entitled to.\"
\"Be obnoxious\"
Show them, he says, \"What do the pretty girls look like?\"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in jackets and identical olive-colored pants, were staring at your guard.
Four pairs of heeled black shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four perfectly sleeved coats at the top of the hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
\"Personally, I think they have a medium appearance,\" said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
\"Models are beautiful.\"
More than one government has tried to refresh China's image of urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the green-grey of uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the drop-eyes with a strong approach: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an uncontrollable snack cart by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the Colporteur rebounds his business and departs.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, their galb and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty attracting attention to China's underground urban brigade
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after he used his cell phone to film them by dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, robbed and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry co-rapporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game of violence, available online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
\"Chengguan marked the government,\" lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a \"veritable complete cleanup\"
The skeptics say that the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new women's recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had any real tasks or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years old, to have a beautiful silhouette and - the five features of the face in the right order -
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retire at 26 years of age is compulsory.
Officers stated that work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
\"It's their image that's important,\" said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
\"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, facial traits, etc.\"
Then comes the temperation and the internal qualities -
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: \"In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the facial traits.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disfigured must not apply.
“We cannot let a person who drinks or a boss come to serve here,” said Mr. Zheng.
\"He wouldn't give a good picture\"
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baogung Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommeled toys with a finely curved mouth.
She does not see the development of her appearance as gender-based, she says.
\"Think I look sexy in this uniform,\" she asked for an outburst of air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old greenhouse colleague, said: \"Our job is to present the city's image.\"
They did not object to their limited mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing the sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen traveling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bowls as possible before taking the escape.
\"Master Wang, you must leave\"
\"We have already told you several times,\" said Mrs. Xu when a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her bicycle-carrette with noodles.
Agents describe their functions as rather monotonous than darts.
\"It's about the same thing every day,\" said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
‘Grand routines
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calmness is not guaranteed at all.
Just two blocks of houses from the placid Bauguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the face of the disaster, broke a tail path to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male team coordinator, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male or male coordinators aged 40 or older are simply supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
\"At times, we fight verbally\"
\"At times, we physically fight,\" said Mr. Li, \"out of a neutral tone.
\"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts\"
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the honourable senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential until the scandal around his case did not make the big national titles last year and damage his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was \"very happy\" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Ministry of Justice had - reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this case -
The Ministry of Justice refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, regarding the honourable senator's case with her.
Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying with his former employer or Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends prior to the case, appears to contradict the so-called prohibition of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, “there seems to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the rotating door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients of a government investigation.
Although the Ministry's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be suspicious of political prosecutions after a number of high-level reversals by its section of public integrity, including the decisions made last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take arms, Melanie Sloan, the director general of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
‘This basically say high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them — she added.
Paul Coggins, the lead lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for accusations against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the honourable senator, as his office reaffirmed him on Wednesday in a communiqué, had acted in accordance with the law.
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecutor's office.
\"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,\" he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was everything except a gift.
NV Energy, a major company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he \"marteled\" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Alligant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after having hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr.Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fight a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr.Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and would terminate his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the ranges of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and the children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements in the courtroom that outline arguments of appeal, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is causing is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a - circus atmosphere -, so widespread and instant saturation with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could lead the appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
\"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the human rights of a fair trial,\" said Mr. Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, tearfully rejected the claims in the judgement delivered last week, claiming that the media were \"sensely controlled\" and that there was no evidence that the jury was likely to have been driven by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Appeals have acknowledged for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgement dated the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a \"carnaval atmosphere at trial\" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film \"The fugitive\"
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review a half century later Mr. Hayes' conviction may be curious given the argument that new rules may be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
\"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media - in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue states that some court of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trials.
The Twitter case is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photographs of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media kept attracting the flames of the emotion of the case.
\"The daily buzz of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in the courthouse,\" wrote the lawyers, \"didn't look like anything that had ever been seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level.\"
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new instantaneous ones were more incendiary than the later releases was a ludicrous view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers stated that the appeals courses were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had overturned Dr Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and indicated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
\"This case - they wrote - representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.\"
Can civilization bring the cleavages closer?
After a campaign marked by inventiveness and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this an early sign of genuine two-party cooperation in advance or at an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress has produced no insight into the major issues that need to be addressed during the session of the \"boxed canal\"
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The committee's Wednesday public meeting on the President's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a time of testing and mutual testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
This is why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, spending, health care or rights, the two parties remain at thousands of distances.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
\"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone,\" said Pete Wehner, a Bush Administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
\"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections spark partisan passions, and then they blow away.
That's good.
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the boxing canard session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or a whole, on a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, it would only be because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the \"boxed canal\" session, with the ratification of the \"New START\" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the \"lame dock\" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
\"Once things are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,\" he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or a shadowboxing relative to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early responses to the recommendations of the Committee on the Deficit, which include reforming the taxation code and increasing certain taxes, reusing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes in the committee, made up of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had trouble reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, which suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, tax and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will be careful to observe the public response.
The person who will be judged to lose will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties saw 2010 as a simple prelude to a more significant election in 2012.
Given this reality, this week's civility could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be required from both sides to find common ground on the issues that divide them further.
U.S. documents disclosed depict Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a \"Kleptocracy\" and passes to the Kremlin a portion of the wine pots and the protective money it collects, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the \"vertical of power - - - takes its part while the money runs up the ladder.
The Service Note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on its website on Wednesday by Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expelled.
She was drafted while Jouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow, and is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he declared what follows a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: \"It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything.\"
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime led some people to name it \"dysfunctional\" and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government - according to the embassy's note.
\"The criminal elements enjoy a \"krysha\" (the term used in the criminal world/the Mafia which literally means \"tote\" or \"protected\") that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City Government.
\"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world\"
\"Luzhkov is at the top\"
- The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at second level -
\"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.\"
\"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services\"
The report indicates that the FSB is collecting money from larger companies and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, he said, \"explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.\"
\"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high\"
The note points out that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred to the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted that there was little progress.
The embassy's note transmits accounts of men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, up to the Kremlin.
\"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev relies on bureaucrats,\" he said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the \"Indem tank\" of Moscow.
\"But he's part of this bureaucracy.\"
\"It is not part of a political class because there is no such thing in Russia\"
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the American Embassy's note, which was realized only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements made by U.S. diplomats by calling it Batman and by raping Robin's Medvedev.
\"The problem is that this is our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,\" he said.
\"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics\"
Former Red Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor-quality concrete walls, the director of the Anlong Veng secondary school referred to the man who had built it, the last chief of the red Khmer, Ta Mok.
\"Everyone here loves Ta Mok\"
\"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,\" said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as the butcher, for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Reds in north-west Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual which, for the first time, taught the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, handed its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, at 35 years in prison, the former chief of the sadly famous torture centre at Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as \"Duch\"
In the face of this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Red Khmer of Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their will to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
\"There are feelings and fear among former Khmer Reds but they are powerless to do anything,\" said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
\"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil.\"
“The situation generates divisions within families”
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or over-handling.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government of Pol Pot-Uni in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas at their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red fighters began to defect the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who took the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the former red Khmer fighters have fallen into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer Red elite officers have held their local leadership positions in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are unskilled farmers at the low rank and file.
\"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation,\" said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
\"They are imbibed by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime\"
“They have been raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
\"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,\" he said.
\"Ta Mok feeds everyone\"
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs -
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge senior officials and principal perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond those four cases.
It would take more time to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, a 64-year-old district chief in the province of Banteay Menchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, on a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
\"Cambodia is at peace and stable,\" she said.
\"If there is more prosecution, there will be war\"
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians objected to this.
\"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,\" he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
\"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,\" he says.
\"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand\"
The centre produced the first approved government manual on Red Khmer, \"A history of Democratic Kampuchea, made up of 75 pages\"
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valak, 19, a senior student at Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticically when he returned with the book at home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
\"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue\"
Such resistance made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a road, invaded by the weeds and scattered with plastic bags, leads to a black silk rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone salesman on a roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
\"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray,\" she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of mature bananas in the hope of bringing chance.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it was going to abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Belarusian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials have told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a grievor who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
\"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit - Security Summit -
“This proves that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton has described the agreement - of very significant, important step - made by Belarus.
Obama pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all the vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
About a dozen countries have done so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Security in Obama, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never abandon its uranium.
\"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and weak enriched uranium,\" said Mr. Loukachenko.
\"It's our product ... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone\"
\"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all\"
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, it was of interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials indicated.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and deleted, officials indicated.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
\"A thorough coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence - leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a director of the Department of Energy specializing in the Reduction of the World Menace.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential renewal.
\"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens,\" she said.
The government has issued no objections to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to -can demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft flying across Spain -
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe, which accused a number of anti-human rights practices of dozens of countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report, which had surprised the Government of Zapatero out of the game, insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
‘From Vega noted that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights above the Spanish territory —
\"They just want to be informed - to prevent them from being taken away - reports Aguirre in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence capacity -
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
\"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information,\" the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States has expressed concern about -the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors - more than the declassified information of the Ministry of Defence's CNI o.
This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments, regret Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that even though the Spanish judges were in a madly jealous of their independence and would do what they thought was right - he had given instructions to his collaborators - to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric, by trying to lower the temperature -
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this case.
\"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States,\" she points out.
The parricid that passed to the confessions complained in the network of the \"acquisement\" of being a mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: \"T error to the Galician\"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is -Muki - in the network.
With this nickname she used when she was a little girl, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both of them from Noia, the village of Coruña whose origin it is.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Not long after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elite was Alberto, a young man from Lausanne, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has broken down, they have separated.
In March 2008 she found herself in Minorque, alone, and wrote: “Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there”
\"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and does not have the freedom to do what he wants.\"
And then, she's talking about a mobile message she just received: \"I want you to come in this month or you give me an address to send you the child\"
Ella complains: \"If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back - she leans.
In the month of May, she talks about the return to her village: \"This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because the 20th I have to come to a job so I don't lose it.\"
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
\"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him with someone else if that person is not my mother - a dubious intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there was another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposed to have been murdered on the 10th, died.
\"César is happy on the one hand, but he's not on the other\"
\"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day\"
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
\"It will go there (the child) at a few hours of summer and so I save some money from baby sitter\"
On 17, greetings and complaints.
\"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come\"
\"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos to the e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit.\"
On 30, another: \"The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: \"He's ahead of me money\"
On the Internet it has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the universe MySpace, now blocked, where her name was \"Muki the liberator of the prison\"
\"T mistake to the Galician (epigrapher).\"
The last man who lived with her, being vigilant, expresses his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think everything happened so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detainees in Minorque.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she doesn't remember how the facts happened, and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either.
She had previously confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor called for a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the CSP would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training gets in these doubles normally the one it receives in the Catalans.
As a result, the Catalan populace obtained 610.473 votes from the 2008 generals, while the 2006 autonomics had won 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts in this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also earn four (now 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 MPs (there are 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the most upcoming meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comecies, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relays at the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the populace agree with the fact that the CSP could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority of the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic that this formation loses its representation in Barcelona City Hall - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians held by officials of the General Intelligence Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell, which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, among which - The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land - (LTTE) and -Laskar e Taiba - (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay bombings that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has attached great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that, with-the Kampai operation, it has been weak, the international falsification apparatus of Al Qaida and, consequently, its operational capacity,
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that included the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its fighters could pass the European and other western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations took part, apart from Thai services, of other European police units, so that in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who have been leading the cell in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - primarily robbed tourists of passports that met the conditions of the so-called \"World Islamic Front\"
That is to say, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay bombing, even though the author of this attack, \"Laskar e Taiba\" was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalunya was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were (invested) to buy mobile cards that were used after the \"commando\" integrations, which killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, was given the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas's conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and who resumed to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-Souverainist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half of his mandate.
The Catalan People's President arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he obtained 18 members in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because CiU's candidate requires that at least one of the trainings that the oppositions will abstain in the vote on the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are being made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the PP president, to support an investment - all sovereignist and independentist speeches should be eliminated - and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converged leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders share their bets to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated self-government and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's investment will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalan).
Geriatrics claim that the dead were not due to the \"lack of measures\"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Officers of the Geriatric La Charita d'Olot (Gérone) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven older people he was responsible for in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, came along with the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that \"the desire of La Charitat would be to be able to charge the accused with the responsibility of the dead but - the legality and responsibility of us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials -
And apart from the social discretion that the entity may suffer in order not to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Charitat now takes the form of an important compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' parents.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime occurred on August 2009 and that from that day on he continued to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients from the geriatrics - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally exploit the deceased but, given the age and the pathologies of the patients, formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and pointed out that - the lack of measures could not have been the cause of what happened -
La Charita's lawyer added that, in this case, there is only one indication of recklessness on the part of any other person other than the accused,
The person already baptized as the \"Ange de la Mort\" admitted 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Charitat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff from the centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them lessive as he has already admitted that he did with the three women he killed in between October 12-17.
The Charitat does not believe the nurses' statements at night, nor the number of convicted murders, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available for justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threats
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of Trichet yesterday, which warned that - markets should not underestimate our ability to react -
Differentials of peripherals have closed in force and actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative closures.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended, at least until March, and that they will continue to sell to the quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase program will continue and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction of trafficking in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared with 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval from its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a safe haven.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the action plan to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four Vivaldi seasons.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it resolves with a strong demand and helps dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
To ask for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, triple from March, to very expensive types, and they cut access to sine-day markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, apart from being, to appear.
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia asked by her sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, for he considers him to be the law-enforcement council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to defend their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the executive bodies of El Enebro.
Its Board of Directors has been excluded by five of its seven sons who have been appointed directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, whose challenge is recorded in the Register of Trade and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next 16th, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the tinkerbox within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is characterized by David Álvarez as a \"desperate response of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly distorting the Act and by abusing the law, validating and correcting the assembly radically null on 18 January - according to its official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly takes place, it is contested by considering that the assembly is not fully entitled to it.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks the use of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the rising trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all won on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as the champion's driver, German Sebastien Vette, also the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the \"secret weapon\" that the multinational company Siemens has put in Red Bull's hands to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-off objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create plant assembly chains manufacturers from around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute - in a few hours, almost real time - the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working with powerful computer equipment to analyze and project all sorts of changes to the diseases.
Siemens' leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull's packages except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can change from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this technological development folia there is the amount of $40 million each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its diseases in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that goes on there is considered top secret
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Form 1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put into the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and not known.
The company's technology director, Steve Nevey, says five years ago, it could be said that R & D's progress in race cars brought 50% of the winnings and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while the pilots bring 15% of the value added.
Nevey confesses that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, as they are unforeseeable gladiators -
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20-storey network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to deploy 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be affected interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive trading network claims to - improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging -
Barcelona's store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
\"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days\"
“This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already hired technical assistance services,” Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers at his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be attempted to offset partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million special customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new management plan that will be eligible for three years.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can get out of the bank -, its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank had more spoiled SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise this year's Optima Master Plan, which was drawn up four years ago, even though the plan was originally for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional fiscal year.
Customers who let the savings banks out will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year - difficult and transcendental -
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain - will be slow -
In addition, in two or three years it will be very difficult to create jobs, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and crates pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to offset the fall in margins.
-The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit -
\"We didn't lock the faucet, but the differentials are higher,\" said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see FiveDias of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now - is to increase commissions - but - there is a competitive framework -
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain - we will ask for larger dimensions -
\"Everything will move next year,\" he said.
He claims that the capital needs - rise enormously - and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but instead of what happened in June, funding can be obtained in the short term through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the banks
The ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector would take place.
When the Spanish Savings Fund concentration trial began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations yesterday.
\"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it can't be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank group is a second phase, these are adjustments.\"
\"Most have been fully realized; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well,\" stressed the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is carried out - at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain - has emphasized it.
“The 45-box pass with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets at 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that - there are a number of rather unhappier opinions on the slowness of the process - which demonstrate - a lack of seriousness and meaning - because the Bank of Spain reminds us that the deadline must be met by the end of the year -
The ECSC Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and, probably, in the world and that it has given people who question it a \"lack of knowledge\"
The leader noted that given the current economic environment, - we can remain very calm - with the financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration - very important - and - went as fast as possible -
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector drew on the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin opted to remain in the euro, but it established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of EUR 426 of assistance to unemployed people without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And then Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashs with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, one begins to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis in Germany.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among others, and the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, even though it now seems like science fiction, with a very favourable trend of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second blow in the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved and, the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that transgress the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The timing is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will allow us to have greater peace of mind.
And that we can seize the opportunity that we have been given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it in this form and its double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past on Saturday with large companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggest that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude the abandonment of an overcrowded monetary zone from countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us about it.
Sport and law fraud
The hives similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of gold in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23rd November match against Ajax in the League of Champions caused a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match was over (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately wasted their time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of its group, the two players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next game of the Auxerre dam match and will be able to pass by cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned with two matches the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the related case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn displays nobility and honor and who in past occasions has condemned a fine to his players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, that he adds an episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions we commit a fraud of law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets to which we refer with the correct game is to prevent the team of violators from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate that it is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in hiding to try to avoid the punishment, but their action has specifically tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbiter.
They were waiting and they willingly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders gain from the intended errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that there is no disadvantage to the rival and there is no advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on those players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of extermination, because the team could be eliminated all at once and apart from that, with this action players perform a penalty match and pass into the second round of cardboard, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboard occurs with a less than the first cycle.
So, grating the scales, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which is still part of strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), but they chose instead the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing the penalty or running away from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think that a clear case of genius has been made.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears to me because of two factors: for there have been two self-ejections and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes, also come to dinner groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive your adjusted price to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the industry interviewed.
To complete accounting, this year's calendar (such as St.Sylvestre's night falls on Friday) concentrated the applications in the week of December 13, which has so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the circumstances, they all ask for battle prices, confirm the president of Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before they book”
\"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,\" he says.
The case will go well - for those who give quality at good price and with good service - he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go a step down with the crisis, so that the slice around the 25 euros became majority in the demand.
In a survey in various institutions in the centre, there is a batch of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine demand boom for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjunction, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the particularity of the calendar assumed more early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros - detail them.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and good ones, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine manufactured according to the champagne method - 'cave'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
On the part of the patron saint Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), his vice president, Henry Gomà, is confident in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that overall reservations are - animated - even if customers - negotiable to the maximum -
This is true, the hope for festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a faster rate than any other country -
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, \"decreased\" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world -
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: -The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials -
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason to maintain custody.
\"Pakistan has staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,\" said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan's nuclear weapons production.
A press release from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as \"fruitful,\" supports the following: \"Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated.\"
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of National Intelligence for South Asia, noted that \"despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world\"
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it very clear to the head that the Army of Pakistan must end up with the silent support of terrorist groups.
Hunting the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist officer to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to follow the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a \"red alert\" to \"localize and follow the movements\" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents in the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange -
On 20th, the international police corps having the seat in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 countries of Interpol were indicated to identify or locate Assange - to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition -
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the network call not to be a freeway for arrest - that the national police force must realize -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be present.
The movement condemned Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained a permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Head of Security of Stalin.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to find herself in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she has been responsible for ordering American graduates to use the United Nations in violation of the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Press Secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as \"ridiculous and absurd.\"
\"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us,\" he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations - to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance -
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to come back to his statements after saying that Assange should - be murdered -
\"Obama should turn it into a goal and use a flight without a crew or something\"
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
\"He who is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason, and whatever is not an execution would be too kind a punishment,\" he said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks ERC peace with eyelines to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Hugot proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the internal uprising within the ERC, with no north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira's followers, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his mentor and that it cannot absolutely give him any headaches that he had with other outcast currents.
That's why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new criticisms with eye crevices that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Cardists want to bring a certain penalty vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of rank wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result - in Bulgarian - would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to make his position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth it when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider as a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC has admitted that \"polyphony\" affects stability and that his goal is to make once and for all the organization able to wash his own living room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' idealist, the owner of Innovation believed that the leader will be ratified - in exchange for various objectives - is as though he did.
And he listed five, of which he stressed two.
The first, \"recompose\" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures coming from the Adhesive Sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquid once for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows for the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession with the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the Conclave Convulse of 2008 commissioned the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there has been a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders, these three women are mentioned and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases are the one of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of fire and the blow of thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the dead body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan Municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the four, the owners of land operated in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal strokes in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his home to initiate order collection work.
On 7 November, two 30-year-olds were killed by a head shot impact on each of the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the blow of grace in the front we found a man's corpse on a lonely road of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet percuted with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the settlement Plaza Golondrina.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough research of the rest of the body members, but were not found.
Tepotzotlán residents warned about the discovery of a dead body in Peña Colorada, the hands attached behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a shot of fire in the back of the head.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with shots of fire in the head was found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces were detected with her image.
Towards the end of the month, a man's body was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their head in the cloud and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: “This is what happens to those who do not align”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the settlement Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Close to him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in COP16 assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and had detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, Su Wei, representative of that country to COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he has reported that his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese climate strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with regard to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, detailed it.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country with regard to climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than expected.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plans to make it a similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is law.
In his interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
\"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of the Order of Sonora\"
Mr Espino has the right, if any, to appeal to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body, he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that it is not time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidature.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections, where a successor should be elected.
“This (a 2012 alliance) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, was an approach to the local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that the NAP is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why internal competition does not make us afraid; on the contrary, we will enjoy it and make us stronger, he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elect the best leader whose National Action needed for the next three years, so he would give the person determined by the council the reinstatement.
\"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five\"
He predicted that the party's re-launch in the 4th of July elections will be reflected in the next dispute, even though it is not yet the time to think about 2012 -
\"For the time being it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task\"
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations.
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
\"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they leave 'armoire',\" he said.
He stated that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no barbarity, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for undocumented students
\"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,\" tweeted the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
\"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,\" said Twitté Obama.
Its short message maintains a cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as voting in legislation is imminent.
\"There's a vote that we'll be waiting for soon, now's the time to listen to your voice,\" he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the expansion of tax reductions in Bush's time and government funding were prolonged.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican Locking of the Dream Act and other projects, the Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is solved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
\"I think we have a lot of time.\"
\"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved by the end of the year\"
\"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,\" he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a \"vote to close the debate\" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the U.S. Law would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, at times when the protagonists' partisan organizations are actively lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest Republicans there are Senator Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another republican who supported him, John McCain, has not set his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the greatest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the beach
The second stage of Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants staggered the narrative
“The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? which is hoped for by me,” asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second stage of the Plaisirs de la langue, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (while another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plague -...we put in the embarrassments - has slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and to whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Cellorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the \"plaie\" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a response, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she becomes convinced: “The patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my plague”
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that plagiarism is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: \"The plague is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar.\"
The protagonist sighed and concluded: \"On the beach I only knew that it is open in reality and that it does not exist - but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very close to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating story that he called Eloge à l'invention, where the finger on the plague is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous insurgent who touched clouds, turned people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a story to turn to speak to America, the great news that had since the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
\"Certains who invented all of us (the writers) mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have contained the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the godliness\"
Nevertheless, he stressed, -the madmen and the liars have the best imagination - and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its apogee.
This is in fact called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
\"It's because of his legacy that we're what we're counting on.\"
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauds the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le owes on the plague.
Cuba-Portuguese has placed itself on the great plague of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - resulting in disputes over drug trafficking and sale.
\"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs are a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated,\" she said, after citing that the reality of the literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a \"chemical reaction\" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed - this must be on the plague of the committed writer -
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that revolves to the advantage of dogmatisms, - after each assertion there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes -
\"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger on the wound and disturbing the people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white,\" he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Roman at the hunt of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he knew three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he knew three times the decisive series, even though until now he did not put in the thousand and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
Argentina ended up comforting itself with the Underchampion Medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive endings.
The holy strategy came to its first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when it held the reindeer of Morelia with which it lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in Clour 2003 it also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Tournoi Bicentenaire, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
\"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important - commented the helmsman when asked him what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, - the only lesson that we can retain is that until the arbiter blows the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, also the players, because the last time, with two penalties to draw us were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate -
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he confides in his players: \"We never seek to arrive at the penalty series, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare us, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer get in that situation.\"
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Persons must go to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC, according to its English-language acronyms) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants, including the following:
The total cost for processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another payment for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on demand (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for commercial and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visas will not have to interview with the Consular Representative, they will only be present at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents, and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because of the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants wishing to have a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will be less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101101_Visas-FAQs.html.
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she cited the press, NASA assured that it would present an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life - which caused speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know.
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
At the conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrono 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress there appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, PRD; and Patrono Montalvo, 'found' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we start 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Director-General chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way are the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from political will and if they did not, they would again be served by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
\"As far as the opposing coalition is concerned, this is what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest.\"
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it has continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now -duopolistic -
\"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress\"
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they now speak to other colleagues to make them more numerous, has subscribed the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'future' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
\"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two\"
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
\"That they don't leave by cupulary agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we don't agree with that reform.\"
$200 million more for -the supplier -
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another cheque to the asked owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of weight favours Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of \"supplier account liquidity\" .
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
\"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,\" he said in an interview.
The last cheques appeared in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Northwest had published a review of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, revealing that in the period of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the City to pay Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, with cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the downfall of a foreign tourist in a creek of the Sanchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be treated and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists have come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid close trades.
“Politics don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune that is lost, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for such a long time and without adequate planning”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the City Hall.
\"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just make the correction,\" he said.
\"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only is it because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as people who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to keep the city well\"
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
\"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions,\" he said.
\"We have not given them the attention they need, and this kind of fact underlines something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary\"
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, stated that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
\"Mazatlán has a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put on line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination\"
IP calls for results to Congress
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members should be responsible for being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
The business sector in Mazatlan seeks a work law that is worthy and free of agreement between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was set up by seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new constituents of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party mind or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members should be responsible for being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
\"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they become a carnival mask of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions\"
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
\"We will ensure that they do decent work, especially with society and sectors, because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, for now the economic situation is very complicated.
\"The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will stimulate the generation of jobs.\"
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
\"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a lower budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and directly rivals agro-industry\"
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonatory tourism projects that help to give the State the safety and update the Alcohol Act that the earlier legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king mage.
Puppees, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live in the daytime because their father does not have a stable job.
\"At times it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the \"plebes\" for sale in the street,\" said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her three-year-old sister, Isabel, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster trick' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
\"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive - he remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, shoes size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
\"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hasch, money and equipment used for production were seized,\" said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leaders assumed in this network, two Sherbrooke men.
Arrested persons were due to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession in order to deal with trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were conducted following a long-term investigation, which lasted about a year.
\"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests,\" Mr. Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problem
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, should address the problem of ships in charge of illegal migrants, is clearly being beaten while the three opposition parties reported on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I strongly support the Charter”
\"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,\" said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow all persons to be detained for up to one year from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took the wrong target.
\"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government will do,\" Mr. Duceppe said.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms that his party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
\"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, C-35,\" said Ms. Chow.
\"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,\" Ms. Chow explained.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
\"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown.\"
\"They expect Canada to take firm action,\" said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections for its rejection.
However, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would then speak before his or her constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Minister of Public Safety Robert Dutil argues that this idea is not dated yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Research on this subject from January last.
The metropolis has a permanent corruption unit since 1870.
However, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for Beijing's public security critic Stéphane Bergeron to call this ad of \"lapin out of a hat\" and \"brittled solution on the corner of a table\"
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
\"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just going to assert it.\"
\"We are aware of this problem.\"
For the CSQ President, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
\"More Mr. Charest refuses to want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me he has something to hide,\" he explains.
\"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest,\" explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
\"We must be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate,\" he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent scout is not the only project in the Charest government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would arise from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed to him that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this matter.
In the Spring 2001 operation, which hit motorist groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
High-monitored rivers
A number of watercourses remain under high surveillance due to the severe precipitation that has taken place in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have taken place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There was a busy road.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the snow source already accumulated in certain sectors, there are fears that several rivers will overflow.
Warnings of flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and in the Cheenna, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood surveillance and remain under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitation has led to the overflowing of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overrun of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Puntefract.
Civil Security remains on the alert and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
Quebec's Crude Forecast Centre issued on Wednesday warnings of strong crosses for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ouareau, L'Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially blamed Dupont
Quebec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont has undergone a partial reversal before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its coarse wave language.
The CCNR finds that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that did not fit the broadcasts during the day-
The Commission also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of the Social Assistance Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must present solid information rather than deceivers.
Regarding suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had estimated suicide to be a gesture of laxity.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
\"The majority of the Committee considers that the events in question of \"Dupon le midi\" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner.\"
Therefore, no blame has been held in his place.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
CHOI's host stated that he had made no gift to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
\"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it.\"
\"My file has been blank for a year and a half,\" said the facilitator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated - beyond its obligation -
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during high listening hours within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealers Nacereddine Zemmal has a very special course.
The athlete that excels in Şsanda - (kung-fu -full contact -, kickboxing and boxing thai mounts on the tatamis and the world's rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals”
\"In my case, I'm looking for fights all over the world, as for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America\"
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as an agent for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to its rivals, bringing two gold medals to the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
\"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and boxing thai, he explained\"
\"Now I am preparing to go to China for the Cup of the World of San Shou\"
\"The fighters who ended up among the first four at the last World Championship in each category were invited\"
\"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto\"
\"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth\"
“In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added”
\"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition\"
\"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year\"
The \"san shou\" or \"sanda\" is a discipline originating in China where punch and foot strokes, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to hold in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament -King of Sanda - the kung-fu Super Bowl.
\"This competition is the most important and most prestigious competition in China,\" said the friendly Gaillard.
\"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)\"
\"This has been a great experience\"
Zemmal won his first fight, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
\"He who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed\"
There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg) -
\"The winners of the semifinals face in the final of their category\"
\"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of kung fu\"
450 million contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the most important, the stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without call for tenders.
This consortium, known as Energy Management, was set up in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice of entrusting the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship Consortium took advantage of the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and cause price increases.
\"This is the new way of collusion and abate competition\"
\"That is to say, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly,\" said Beijing MP Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to see how the public's interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
\"I'm starting to have my trip,\" she weighed, arguing that the QP had been \"bad,\" and had \"lacked rigour.\"
She said that - that would be the least of the things - that the QP apologizes.
The formula of consortia is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the scale of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition play acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week in Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register enables more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its leading competitors, including CIMA+, Genevar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and even moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Consortium Energy Management, Minister Normandeau stressed that the Bay James territory has responded to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it in a particular way since the 1970s -
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it a point to stress that the project's stewardship contract was granted willingly.
\"If you go on call for bids and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher\"
\"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say, we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price\"
\"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the people's competence,\" said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has broken 22 contracts, Genevar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship contract of $295,31,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec -
Minister Normandeau dropped that the QP was also linked to these companies that finance it, before stating that it was more of its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The label - truth - does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptic.
The Quebec consumer gives very little confidence to those involved in sustainable development, but also to fair marks and eco-labelling certifications to guide his choices.
On the other hand, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption drive, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even qualifies as a brake on his commitment, he indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another point is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on fair products, but also of the credibility of products and trademarks which appear to be eco-responsible, says Barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians' discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this trend in the current animated consumption by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would calm the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are also calling themselves distrustful of the alleged performances of green products or services that they are seeking to put in their hands.
On another note, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also favoured purchases from local merchants and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 over a maximum of 100 for this year - the Consumer Homo of Quebec likes to present himself as the king of recycling seeking to reduce his environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
However, his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transportation or advocated co-piloting to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioural survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was asked to make a financial commitment to the repurchasing of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Society and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only against one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallèle, which hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematic complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full Cinephilic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to involve itself in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least the opinion of sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal was reached at SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to answer them.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the State's gift must really be ignored.
Let's recall that the Association of Film and Film Owners of Quebec opposed a direct investment of the State to support the repurchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
However, a number of stakeholders in the environment were calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the Master of Ceans, has for ten years put the author's cinema behind him in his complex premises after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his clients.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $70,000 to push on the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
Sailing on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil of what the United States considers to be the lower complex of Canadians towards Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of their superiority towards Canada.
For example, U.S. diplomats are surprised that each Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in public square yesterday, offer more crisper details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in the middle of a federal election campaign, which tells how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
\"A complex of Canadian inferiority almost inherent may require Canadian political leaders to speak of everyday domestic issues rather than to have this election run over the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), he writes.
The United States is therefore, in conclusion, the proverbial elective of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak about it.
The ambassador understands all the less this \"sustaining silence\" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
\"Unquestionably, he believes that the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote\"
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
\"Your trip will help ensure the Government's survival during the vote of confidence early in February on the federal budget, by which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a re-launch plan of $30 to $40 billion,\" writes Mr. Breese.
There is no indication that the government had to extend the pre-Christmas Parliament to avoid being overturned by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their conditional survival conditional to the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast at CBC refer from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the \"No-Fly-List\" or the CIA's abductions for muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of case-by-case
At the end of the meeting, it is written, \"he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin\"
-The secretary agreed to review the file -
Finally, let's note that the spirits warm up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be -- murdered --
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed to Cancún yesterday a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments by industrialized countries to reduce.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolise from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by light-diade ampoules (DEL or LED), most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen, last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, whose Canada has engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should move the overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will need to take this balance sheet off again to stabilize the 2-degree increase in climate by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampoules, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact ampoules last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves for fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers put in place the instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulb, but rather coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is anxious to announce election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the publication, without delay, of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadline has expired.
The Secretary-General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay, stressed a spokesperson for the head of the United Nations.
“He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional outcome is announced”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission passed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had stated on television that the commission continued to work to announce the results.
The calls multiplied Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of votes - fraudulent - in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidation of voters practiced by FNs in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denied any connection with the former rebels, judged the delay in announcing the results to be unacceptable and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go until he claimed victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The President's second round on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ITB) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate appears to rise by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a new rise in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 in three months, +0.5 in one year) and 25% by including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 15-24 year-olds were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight rise in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 point over three months as well as over one year), 482,000 people aged 50 years or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age have benefited from stability of unemployment in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and maimed at Luynes' detention home near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was screened for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, recel, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, her lawyer said.
\"Alexandre Guérini is a combative one and wishes to explain himself on all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts.\"
\"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them,\" said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong PS man in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also screened Wednesday night and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to handle.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew about them, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was examined Wednesday for the diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
\"My client has been able to provide an explanation for the facts being brought to him.\"
\"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of freedom,\" said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Cleanness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for \"traffic of influence and passive corruption\"
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined one for - the removal and diversion of public property by one person in charge of a public service mission - the other for - the complicity of the diversion of public funds -
Finally, Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was screened for \"recel of abuse of social property\"
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement for Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies to have used money laundering from the big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for fraud alleged in the procurement of public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
As a source close to the investigation, the research focuses, inter alia, on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for \"expionage\", held the opinion in halein in France, put diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the careful look of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice for the treatment of their own \"hostage\" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French girl had not had to offset the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to confirm the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled \"Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases\"
The Councillor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do all they can to repatriate their own strong nationals to Iran.
\"Making noise,\" they say, \"martling constantly\" in the media, the words \"rights of fundamental man\" -- \"innocentness -- \"immediate liberation\"
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
\"Do it all the more so that the Iranians ask you not to do so\"
Because, past the attempts of discussion through discrete channels, - silence will rule nothing - the Iranians are - masters in dilatery maneuvers -
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail.
He announces that the release of prison in Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the Embassy of France) - will need the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money - €230,000 in bail).
And he tells us that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that would get worse.
The Iranians could - in the near future stop another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran - he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is being broadcast: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States demands extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment into Iran, is released in Paris, by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which targets the Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is bad news.
Did France accept a merchandise?
The release of Iran against that of the French woman?
At a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he said, not only was it completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision, but sought to oppose it.
\"There has been strong exchanges between the French Presidency and the guardianship of the seals - (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but - the French government cannot go back on the decision - judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the \"close\" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée's advisor consists of a telephone number, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran - is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy -
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée does not manage its efforts, through press releases and \"fuits\" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a \"important\" and \"influent\" role of \"mediator\"
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles impact the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the media 'blitz' of French officials -
On what is the basis of so much “gratitude” expressed to Mr Assad, the Embassy is asked in Paris.
\"Despite their praising statements, the French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done\"
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée was involved in this fiction.
The intense communication effort - aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria - analyses it.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited -
By exaggerating the Syrian role - Paris seeks to -show Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region -
The objective is also to spread seeds of discord between Syria and Iran -
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: \"Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything.\"
\"But we thanked them anyway.\"
“This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it from the Elysée.
In a press release, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their active \"rolling towards the liberation of our country\"
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called \"Cendrillon\" law, which will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
\"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day\"
\"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep,\" said AFP Jo Rin, the Chief Executive Officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them, added the responsible.

South Korea is one of the most - connected countries - and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.

World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa refers to the organizing countries
In the midst of suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice in which struggles of influence and lobbying are likely to take steps on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen Competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Crayff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
Corrugated treatments are therefore likely to last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once in 1966.
The BBC released one layer on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that includes three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease Fifa and embarrass the English leaders, who have launched into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the organization of the JO-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to surround England's Blason with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could soften their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, becoming a heavy outlier despite the shortcomings of its file (state, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced a \"unfair competition in the preparation of the vote\" in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
\"We're covering them with mud, we're trying to compromise them,\" Mr Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new nominations appear premeditated for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World Cup-2026 to China, which Fifa so strongly wishes, would effectively lead to the fall of Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the great game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new borders, but these two countries present more risks than certain ones.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of paid TV rights (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
One warrant to the Elysée calls it another.
So the current Head of State will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence doesn't do well with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
So we must pretend that there was still doubt.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a severe air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that he would make his decision - anywhere in the fall of 2011 -
In front of MPA parliamentarians on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of \"two terms of office\" therefore sowed a bit of febriality.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president only recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made a point, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's mentioned the president's tone of humour at such meetings.
\"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me - he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelle in May 2010: \"Don't think I don't think I'm thinking about the next step.\"
His earlier remarks do not make him more candidate than he did before; they make him no less.
If they raise comments, that is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's entry into high school that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is clear from his 2012 application that many of the PS demand an earlier battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's nomination to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
\"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this issue - he immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
\"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,\" says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
\"He will always believe he can win\" correct Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its State securities purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the procedures for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt emission institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as a situation worse than it is in today's bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis of the states in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...).
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove any more dissensive about his intentions, merely indicating that the State securities purchase programme on the secondary market was continuing, and that we will see what we will decide at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of market operators, she would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the euro system have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the expectations of a continuation of purchases are clear (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect significant changes in their heads.
If lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB is still receiving unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
\"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program.\"
\"If not, it would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term,\" says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's economist.
\"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely - it anticipates on its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, the ECB should maintain a volume of purchasing these obligations to encourage an atone market, adding Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
\"It is necessary for it to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a packaging of the yields paid by the most fragile states,\" testified an important bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates fly, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Saving the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government does round back
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline in bond rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
Upon a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as \"indescriptable\" and expect an unforeseeable weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday, in any event, the gap with German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to a degree of suffering in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, has expressed \"strongly concerned\" about the turbulence of the markets and the possible contagion from Ireland.
\"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland\"
\"The bad news is that it is like Portugal,\" explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax returns that goes with, making the state run the risk of being unable to cover its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget being reviewed in the Senate table on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budgetary collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
\"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken,\" says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
\"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time,\" says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
\"There is no problem immediately, either in the short or in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's stabilization efforts are less than those requested from other countries - see Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held in late March.
There would then be a short period of time for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: \"Europeans, I believe that it has still been demonstrated on Sundays and at night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone\"
Although any relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we still can't talk about a start of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
\"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems,\" said Exane BNP Paribas' economists.
More so, political time is much slower than market time.
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers go well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first FESF securities emissions are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted to Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to the closer-to-effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both of them take every effort to avoid seeking international assistance before they set up their own budgetary corrections and decide on structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
By way of passage to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that a gap of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Black and Red: 24 departments in Orange Surveillance
The snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and freezing.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loire, the Two-Sèvres and the Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowflakes affect northern Gironde and Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are enough to create difficulties of circulation and disrupt some economic activities, Méteo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned with heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of need and the circulation of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture - invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and adapt their driving accordingly -
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris Airport and 10% to Orly due to upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time when the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been beating its full, the billions have been crying.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris Metro which must be built by the Society of the Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a portion of its double loop funding on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, reviewed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of the money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris -
It is calculated as follows: ‘The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year’
The second is an adjustment of a tax on the offices that already exists - in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to assign this increase to the Society of the Grand Paris -
How much would that bring?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
\"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Society of the Greater Paris as a whole and as a measure of the project,\" can be read in the explanatory statement.
In the GSP, we don't find this system shocking.
\"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after, we explain it\"
“This will be included in the budget and drawn up and tailored”
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This scheme, in which the promised 4 billion are still absent subscribers, could lead to a somewhat heated parliamentary discussion.
First open meeting on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The \"extraordinary\" revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and the sinisterly caricature profile of Khadafi has long been for sketch-based cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should only be composed of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts doesn't like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the inexistant), but because those who want to be occult believe only what they already know, and who reconfirm what they've already learned.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
Same for secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (if not it could be, as I know, editor in Libération), who hold only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
Then why did the revelations on these files make such a noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of states can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place US diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the state department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims and the \"hard people\" in a crisis.
But let us come to the profound nature of what has happened.
At Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had completely proven itself since, being able to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power's eye.
But when we show, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it is within the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks did no wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on-line any information reserved - this would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope that we can maintain confidential relationships by telephone.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who discreetly move in diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at the very least, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crabs, that is to say backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wires (telephones).
The videocassettes (analog) had enabled film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macro-portions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communications policy and technology will return to horse-ridden cars.
One last comment.
Once, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies who ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France bids its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review compliance with the rapidly released financing promises (such as fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French binoculars are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has come out of the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment regarding fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track to meet its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, “new and additional” in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to the Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what \"new and additional\" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose procedure has been blocked by France.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission considered the reference year 2009: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the financing of ‘all new projects’ in 2010 is “new and additional”
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or at the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to new and additional funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution between gifts and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro that is given...In addition, it should be counted for its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only to make such a reasoning: it - it respects - its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for itself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France only places 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice step-by-step tour!
In short, in its fast start funding, France has a double swindle: on the one hand, on the other, the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, she can make it believe that it spends EUR 420 million - new and additional - in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems to be true that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries were not completely dubious...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, short-term issue, compared with all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully that will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the issue of ‘additionality’ or the method of accounting for loans will not escape.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of \"additionality\" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Children's Ingested Pesticide Alert
A 10-year-old ingests in one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday of the association Generations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results - do not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated - has bought between July and September foods generally consumed in four meals and a cash in one day by a child of ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as colds, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the base is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five classified carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
\"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying - notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for as in the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide, however prohibited in France.
Even for Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even bread bag and gum chewing were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most “rich” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this pollutant cocktail is probably underestimated according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed, in response to the urgency of the situation, to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop - the increase in civilization diseases -
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
