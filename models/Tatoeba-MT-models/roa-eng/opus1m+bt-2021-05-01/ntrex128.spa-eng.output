The members of the Assembly (AM, for their English acronyms) of Wales are concerned about -- seeming muppets --
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP, by their English acronyms).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned - to remain with Twp and Pwp -
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was \"disgruntled\" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales stated that his group was (open) in the name change, but pointed out that MWP's leap of speech to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the Yorkshire letter or English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support to call the House of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly appear to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disability of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final floor on the question of what should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians turn to polls to vote for a referendum on the country's name change
The electors will vote on Sunday as to whether the name of their country will be changed to the \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
\"Historically, the older people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,\" says Mr. Adams.
\"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.\"
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in another way,” he says.
\"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbours go regularly\"
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that - sooner or later, they will return to the point of departure -
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
\"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,\" he said, \"and will therefore speed up the closure of these churches, as most of the people who move to these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches.\"
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a main shopping street of Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson's faithful made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the rail.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martin, proudly called him the campaigns of the poor.
In July, the expert at the railway called: \"a cultural treasure\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument\"
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, pointed out that she was the first bus in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who left to play the largest Riverside Church lane 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said San Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese - intending to pass the costs - should the board, although it had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old who dives in search of lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of lobsters in California the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the KSWB-TV channel of San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just thrilled to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was -- he was screaming that he had been bitten.

He had the broken collarbone - he observed Hammel when he arrived next to the child.
\"I thanked everyone who came out of the water because there was a shark,\" Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper zone of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to the Swami beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the United Kingdom beauty market, valued at £2800 billion and with an increasing growth compared to the fall in fashion sales and household household amenities, the largest beauty corridors will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if they successfully overcome it, the same will be done in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets looks for ways to use space in shelves that used to be used for TVs, microwaves and household amenities.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double his offer of beauty with up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also revive its range of Boutique makeup with a majority of animal-friendly products, something more and more demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will try its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, in the south of London last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
The online stores and the change to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local shops force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, has stated that stores will increasingly look like shopping malls while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argo discount selling points into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have driven the sales of edible and profitable more these purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues of the sales points of pharmaceutical products into their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: “We have transformed the appearance and the environment of our beauty corridors so that they can enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized personnel who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy -
Peter Jones is - Furious - after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, went \"harassed\" after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly accessories.
This business had compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was - furious - when the golden girl on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and complements, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Pitrow and was profiled as favorite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune, of about £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one consulted source said: “Truly was, with difference, Holly’s top priority.
It was to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to quit left all involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-selling products.
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delaying its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they maintain a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night - it wasn't about business issues -
A difficult conversation - and then we fell in love -
He joked about the criticisms he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider - little presidential - and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of \"newspresenter\"
\"I haven't given up anything.\"
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting with him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stagnated.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the main diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a “adequate response” from the United States to the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
\"We were great with North Korea,\" he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship -
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the trials with missiles, help free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
\"It's very easy to be presidential, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here,\" Trump said, pointing out to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia ravages an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population in Lombok had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” Mrs Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to assist.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not seen as many in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best case, traveling from one island from Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural catastrophes further complicate logistics.
A hospital boat in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's waste infrastructure the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must deal with the pressure of the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from the Chelsea port office when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell on the net.
\"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself all the time possible,\" said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante coming up and gave her a touch. I didn't think too much, just throw the shot.\"
Chelsea was going to win 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in minute 25.
The Blues half-point made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around making a regatta near the middle field and entering the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice walk to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard sits in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball on the network of the second pole with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples at the Champions League. The meeting will be held at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday, which sparked waves of up to six metres, said the agency's spokesperson, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation has been initiated for murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: \"The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street, Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to pick up something in Dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our research -
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
She became perplexed when she discovered what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter within a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
It keeps repeating terrible functions.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing inside the cord controlling the block of floors.
Any person who has information to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously in number 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success by -rewriting history -
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by its fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a \"crazy\" and a \"try to rewrite history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: \"In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell wrong by the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and on the part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historic debate.
What is true is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating.\"
A murderous pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name (Yuan) was found dead with a sectioned and blood-covered artery near a Liupanshui market shot in the province of Guizhou, as reported in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder was prepared to inject vaccines into pigs at a pocilga in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby police station was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth at the pocilla.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig nearly 250 kilos had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
\"My cousin's legs were bloody and shattered,\" said the cousin, who was headed for his last name, \"Wu\" at The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos ran to a farmer in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten by a farmer from Oregon, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a \"disparator\"
- They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them - he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains widespread in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the next few days.
Rosa caused wind surges of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday to five in the morning (east hour) and was almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which move in this direction to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward, to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain clashs with the low pressure approaching, there will be heavy rainfall widespread in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible despondents in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
The heavy rains could turn cannons into icy rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
Low pressures approaching will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes can be observed in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature at short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be an almost 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the centre and east of the U.S., a warm start of October is expected, with widespread temperatures that will run from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average could be reached.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures higher than average for the east of the U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the crackers testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday in six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued at a dead end and the media were interrupting their usual programming to broadcast the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake of Arizona to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average hearing in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football match of the playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, was the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an appearance that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC held the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement informing that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the cameras of the CNN and the CBS captured how protesters shouted when he was trying to climb an elevator to attend a appearance before the Judicial Commission.
While he received these reproaches, broadcast live by the CNN, he was shot down.
\"Looking at my face,\" said one woman.
\"You think he's telling the truth to the country.\"
And he went on: \"You have power when there are so many women who don't have it.\"
Flake said that her office had issued a statement and, before the elevator's doors were closed, that she would tell more in her appearance to the Commission.
The cable and broadcast television channels broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges made against the candidate for the next week, which had been asking for some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"doing politics\" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plan to leave the European Union to \"do politics\" with Britain's future and to undermine the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for the Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the tariffs of the other was - absolutely absurd -
Wayde Killing: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player from LSU during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree homicide, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and the police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, branch of the CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bail of USD 350 000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Judge This issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound in the head head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for their “diligence and search for justice”
Sims was 20.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a match of the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, stated that his team was \"damaged\" and \"in shock\" for Wayde's death.
\"These are the things people always care about,\" Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the neighbourhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social networks, images showed fine layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposing demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of the polarized Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists to whom the anti-disturbs had cut the passage threw eggs and dust painting to them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and the police used dicks to contain the fight.
For a number of hours, independent groups, with messages such as - not forgotten or sorry - faced unionist protesters in the cry of - Viva España -
Fourteen people were treated by mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local means.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose for overwhelming majority independence, although participation was low, as the people who were against secession greatly boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would be independent.
\"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck - he said.
Despite a vital, though narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, Pro-Atalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been revived by politicians on both sides.
\"It's getting more and more tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the next year's European Parliament elections.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for busting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly botched a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to the accesses and to the building itself.
At some point, he might have shot the car with a ballet.
A Menga attack awarded Victory 1-0 to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by achieving the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as an Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's went up one post, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard's have not yet won any victory out of the house and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands his winning streak in the division to six parties. Holt, the incumbent coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step forward long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson got over the defense, but his attempt in front of the doorway failed. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow was shot off after he was hospitalized to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for visitors with the parades played.
That's how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston searched for an entrance, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they could not pass the host's defense and the doorman, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' doorman rejected a kick shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow was far from another Livingston move.
In the Livingston area, they entered long passes constantly, but they were always clear. Two requests for a penalty were rejected, one after an entry from Halkett over the alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
‘Livingston Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and outcome for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and their template have hardly experienced any changes since their rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
I was counting on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormous and led a beautifully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the opposing field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of whom were Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These manifestations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic Accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road to Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped and the cyclist was cared for by paramedics, but died there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that went to the escape at Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Centre Directorate.
The riots began in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continue.
Specialists from an elite team (known as the Tornado) are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight prisoners participate and affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by mild facial injuries at the site.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars -
Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Arid Areas Could Be Benefited)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collection of Hurricane Rosa crossed the southwest of the desert, with a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented in a tweet that only ten hurricanes had retained their status as a tropical storm or depression on a radio station 321 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967 Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometres from the Arizona border -
The latest models of the National Center of Hurricanes range from 5 to 10 centimetres of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarve in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimetres of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains is likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported onweather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to return to Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“It is expected that torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters,” as reported inweather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Subsequently, she will travel to Arizona south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert,” says the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains \"stable\"
A 17-year-old, two out of 18 and one out of 20 were arrested that same night in Radstock, Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who might have recorded what happened with the cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh - suffered from the Middle Ages and the wrath - of the Democratic Party
\"To vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and outrage tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said in a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has, during the entire appointment process, overlooked the pettyness and anger of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the session on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, the \"Americans saw the cunning, quality and courage\" of Kavanaugh.
\"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record at the service of the public,\" he told his West Virginia followers.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
Five weeks are left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't remember, but it's a career, he said.
\"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates\"
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place no later than Friday, reported a high position from the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged through the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a severe earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to hold a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its course.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Catastrophe Management Agency (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronyms) in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not arrive alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, blew up everything on the ground,” Nugroho commented. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronyms) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as - important - and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications - they were totally paralyzed and there was no information - from Donggala, commented Nugroho.
“There live more than 300,000 people,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse,\" he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the officials claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, one hears a man who was on the last floor of a building warning the people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declare, but the evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims for the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff of Donggala has arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees take refuge under a canvas set in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Dosaba.
\"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while aid groups launched the gears of disaster assistance, some people regretted that the shift to Palu of experienced cooperatives was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and staffing can be used if the site concerned is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
\"As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened.\"
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that write the natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which earlier ended that same month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr Mandagi included, were their pupils.
“For my experience in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages showed only one check mark in grey, not two in blue.
\"I think that means that the messages were not delivered,\" he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during a recharge of an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves docked a Brink employee recharging an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, taking 26 750 USD, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic cashier located in the center of leisure and prepared to recharge him with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities must contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapero Change His Name to Ye
Kid Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: \"The person previously known as Kanye West\"
It's been a while since the 41-year-old West was named Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance by \"emotional reasons\" as the programme's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
“I think it’s the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” said West earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with the radio speaker Big Boy.
\"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are —
It is one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred Love and Brother Love names.
An ancient contributor from West, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case letters, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico.
On 2 October 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were building throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge the announcements concerning the I.A. of several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Duplicating the I.A. research budget would be a good start, since all the other countries go far behind the U.S. We have the look in the next advance in the field of the I.A.” says Lee.
The double funding means twice as much as possible that the next major achievement in I.A. is achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book -AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order - was published this month by the editor Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important I.A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an I.A. system that won the best American player in Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the U.S. Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the U.S., researchers often have to put forth a lot of effort to obtain government grants, Lee said.
\"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations,\" Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading people from universities to work in I. A.
Lee commented that some changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations finance American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research by I. A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they are going to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday whether their name would change to a gesture that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy of accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents contend that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has called into question whether the participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: \"It is in favour of NATO and EU accession with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece\"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union, because this means a safer life for everyone,\" said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one afternoon, irregularities had not been reported.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters deposited their vote.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Gjoose Tanevski, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Macedonia's prime minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a country's name change that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
\"We are in favour of getting into NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with the head very high, not the back door,\" Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration -
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide the much needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
\"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a \"confirmation of our future\"
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43% of voters were to participate in the referendum, which means less participation than required.
Another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, dodge the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling rescinded Brighton's defense in victory 2-0 that Manchester City obtained on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in minute 65.
The Argentine mediapoint received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he entered the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He barred a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English foreman used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who struck him with the right foot to avoid the doorman Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
“Agüero has some problems on the foot,” said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to journalists.
We talked about it playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he'd scored a goal at the time.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the contest of the Premier League.
The goal came in minute 29.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice balloon pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some taps before heading to Sterling for the second stick.
The front of the Sky blues threw the ball to the net just before leaving the limits.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a group party of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to save the Rockies party
With the Nationals removed from the contest by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League Division, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first divisional title.
Even if we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open his number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's rear history is 18 wins and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important ones. I don't remember, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for great candidates - he said.
And he continued: \"We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see wickedness, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”
\"We've seen him for the last four days,\" he said, \"the Democrats--they were angry, they were mean, horrible, and false.\"
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the abbots from the public.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Will you close the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Labour Party Members to whom it is told that it is not welcome, and only to say what we think.
My Parliament colleague, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment as being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the area of national security, on Europe. It was ironic that it was matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As was stated in the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday, -we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive -
For the most part of the eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the evening meetings on Fridays of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a more kind and kind policy is already forgotten, if it really applied at any time.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously thought that he shared a similar political vision began to hope that he would radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the standardization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion - of censorship - or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many advices that recommended me to keep my head down and not make me hear so much and that it would - it would be good -
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my full school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councilor or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to ignore my political stances or areas where I did not agree with current leaders.
All I'd say to those who promoted the Friday motion is that I don't understand these wants to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an Invert Ayr climbs to the top
Two essays at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved victory in this most entertaining party of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now head the table and it's the only invincible team of the ten that participates.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better seize the opportunities, those that granted the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
\"We have been tested in all parties and we remain invincible, so I have to rejoice,\" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, took advantage of the opportunities better than we”
Grant Anderson's essay in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, stood in front of the Ayr; but a yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he scored and became a solo essay, leaving the marker at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to take off on a camel, and, on the resumption of the party, the Ayr advanced with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to re-use that they had one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for score to Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made an essay when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, as he did almost since the match resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to the wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to do with the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restoration sector after being revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, which writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source of the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's “floating restoration market”.
“The sea belongs to us”: a coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave blue sea flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: \"The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty —
All over Bolivia, a land without the sea, still vividly remember the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, since Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will take action in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who fights a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
\"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,\" he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide for Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice resolution arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, she may have been disturbed for the past four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
He also suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile, and the possibility of ending 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political mule.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific ocean,” he added.
\"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind\"
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the US.
Ri Yong Ho, the North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks on paralysed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with Kim Jong U, the leader of North Korea.
Ri points out that the continuation of U.S. continued sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to submit to the north is a \"quimer\"
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of abandoning an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the representatives.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or totally protect yourself from the sun, don't look any further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric large-sized hats for their 2019 spring collection on the gateway, gleaming the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large-sized accessories were jewelry sandals, a hag hat and even a pineapple, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masquerades, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation reminded a team of complete diving, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melting ice cream cone.
If you like big-size fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to see on store streets.
The large hats arrive strong-handed from -The Bomba - with a straw hat with a wingspan of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so impractical that it flooded social networks presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as large as the model in bather that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia flakes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera de Jacquemus collection for the spring-summer season 2019 in the Fashion Week of Paris.
As noted by the famous designer Luke Armitage at FEMAIL: “Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized complements.”
John Edward: Linguistic competences are fundamental for the citizens of the world
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams that are reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30 000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS, for their English acronyms), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, he reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the classification tables, being the highest approval rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS centres, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, 72% of those studying in German, 69% of those studying in French and 63% of those studying in Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without doubt.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 % of employers' reasons for the difficulties they faced in filling jobs were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these competencies are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow such a person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and it was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education is now important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, independent colleges can always choose from a number of languages provided by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “competences for international communication”
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait of fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first Los Angeles Lakers match is about to end.
Luke Walton, the Laker coach, has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-temperate that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes it is going to play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell published in a tweet that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session early this week, James was asked by his plans for the six-party Pre-Temporation Programme of the Lakers.
\"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-temperate parties to prepare myself,\" he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five scheduled Trump rallies for the next week, including stops in venues with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view it online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances of the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who were tense because of accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left an early Senate confirmation vote in the course of, at most, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of riots is to help Republicans facing the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that the next week's five rallies aim to - encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives - according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is as crucial to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we can as we can as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium in Wheeling tonight's rally could attract supporters of -Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh's media - as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, who is running behind the polls.
“For Morrisey it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a polythologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive in front of the individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon forts may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
\"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that could be considered a small impulse,\" Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind for and plenty of reasons to be excited, among other reasons the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from the tee to the green and preach with the example.
The gutural shouts of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt who gave them the party in the 15th was received with a similar cry, from those who convey that he believes that the American team has not yet been left.
“What needs to be done to redouble efforts and focus on the party,” Spieth said.
That's what these players did.
18 holes to leave mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four out of four and nothing can hurt them.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine Thursday morning holes.
That crack and the way it flows its energy with the bullying public make it clear that these are the players to win on Sunday, and that there will not be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four balls of the morning, after becoming a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those they don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage towards the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe moves forward by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated duo composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the battle with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in trouble, advancing four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team who made many mistakes during the morning furballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname of \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and the American novice Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who in the two games on Saturday hadn't stood out too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games of fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning furballs, became Henrik Stenson's partner in the ovens, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwestern Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory in front of the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after having lost the two initial holes.
In the story of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual parties has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the trophy owner, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although it has been the best second for two days, it seems to carry out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says that there is no possibility that they will first be unilaterally disarmed if they are not confident
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had adopted - important measures of goodwill - over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not receive any similar replies from the United States,” he said.
\"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no chance that we will first disarmament unilaterally.\"
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a formula of denuclearization - by phases - that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, since he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. President and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump ensured the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weaponry.
Washington has also resisted appeals to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by putting objections to a declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
The idea that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a flame of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust -
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced to bomb and platter by the American leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: \"If South Korea were interested in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stagnation.\"
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct the North Korean missiles to U.S. soil after the -- evil president -- Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim -- rocket man --
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for her bravery in progress towards disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that there was no deadline for this: \"We may take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter\"
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, such as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompey, informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without non-compliance until final and fully verified denuclearization is realized”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompey spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that its \"requirements were those of a mobster\"
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the - corresponding measures -
He said that Kim had informed him that the - corresponding measures - he was looking for the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing machist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One teacher found that students at university number one in the world do not usually have any idea about the basic care of oneself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the U.S.
His motivation for starting the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked why she just heard about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me - he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of setting up a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know it's not going to change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know about the health effects of smoking tobacco, added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for - spending the night on sailing - still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good-quality dream should be — the secret weapon — of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students consider putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the \"blue light\" that emit the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble staying asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: the goal of Menga tomb to the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team at defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's wanted to win their first home win from February 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's team for the second time in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points from the Hearts, led Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place minutes before half-time and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers come down to the sixth position, the Livingston climbs to the third, behind the Hibernian for the gap of goals.
The Rangers may encounter more problems, as the Calum Spence online judge had to receive medical assistance for a head wound after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitor background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the headlines who won the party against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt pulled out the 11 players at Livingston who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have dialed at the first two minutes, when Menga made a pass to space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep fault for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there were more hopes than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished in the minute 15 of the match, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian request.
The Rangers got two rounds in the first half, but the former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely in trouble to deal with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored at minute 34 by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for their dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep play to Jacobs' stop ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to mark the goal.
At the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors to exactly the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett taking off a long walk after another.
Holt's could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow ended a head horn that did not enter.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked to the other side.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, now 136 years ago, and CONTINUING... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then is a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film \"The Cronado bells\", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to - see - malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to -- see -- malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and alters them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can see a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can - see - a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland commented: \"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2 - promotes the growth of different types of cancer - such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and -- teaching them -- attacking cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatrib in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was an abated in the Saturday Night Live study after an erratic performance in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would be presenting for the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to deporate against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"I often talk to someone white and ask how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I cared about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago - he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch program in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although it was not broadcast, comic Chris Rock went up recording West's bronchial to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had gone wrong behind bars to wear that hat.
- They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep - he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"You want to see how sleepy I am,\" and he added that he was going to put on his superman layer, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Tested with love
His comments were received by the public on at least two occasions and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person stated to the magazine: “The study was totally silent.”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he went to the stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest spirits: GRACES FOR RESISTING TO THE MUCHEDUMBER”
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply — being himself and that is absolutely wonderful —
\"But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too - he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying that he was now - the person formerly known as Kanye West -
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the missing legend of the music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.

The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Thrones Game, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Throne Game.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying that those roles on screen often passed on to young boys who had to be hard to respect.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that - something has gone wrong - and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that it seems to him that it is quite important to address this issue.
\"Personally, it seems quite important to me right now, \"Where we've been wrong with masculinity,\" he said.
\"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems that are now seen?\"
Kit believes that television can be a part of responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued: \"What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people -
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Precuela or Sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is - full of battlefields and horses -
Starting in November, Kit will starve True West, Sam Shepard's play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever taken out of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in the series, so in that sense she has given me my future family and my life from now on,\" she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic award-winning series Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on a farm of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14 % increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which means a change with respect to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in full practice, declared the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was disbanded in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff leaks data from Senators of the Republican Party and asserts that these are — dangerous mentors — and — conspiracy theories —
Representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Senators of the Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that these accusations were driven by commentators and websites of “extreme right”
- Lies, lies, and more vile lies - Waters commented on a Twitter publication.
It was supposed that the published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session on accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration took place at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and released data from a Waters staff member, according to the Chapter.
\"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,\" Waters continued.
\"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not responsible for the filtration of this information for any reason.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie -
Waters' statement gave rise to immediate criticisms on the Internet, including those of the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
\"Disminate this information with anger,\" Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that it is not the temper necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
You mustn't rebel.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
You must maintain calmness and serenity -
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction with the critics of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during the appearance of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
\"If it's true, it's very serious,\" he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent charges -
\"We will make sure that the authors are discovered,\" he continued, \"and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.\"
Critique by Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of the spy of Rowan Atkinson gets short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit foxes in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what it is to do with this new delivery of the Parisian franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfying about how clearly screwed up we are the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his heels eyes and his inexppressive face, has renewed his license to put the leg for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that touched a single note on the subject of Fire chariots that was played at the inauguration ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads, sowing chaos behind it.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor while the propellers clashed against the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but the mood gets rather short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises of films - serious - like 007 and Mission impossible to add comic ingredients without problems.
The mood seems more directed to children than to adults and, for me, the absurd misadventures of Johnny English are not as clever and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the current repeated argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all his active agents in the face of the agent's dismay, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script leaves little room for work.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that, as all active spies are in danger, you will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the torpe Johnny English, who now teaches in a pious school, though gives extra-official classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with its suffering old Bough compinche, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batmans and Robins who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire in the world of technology that claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash the chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of the house of Volta.
Definitely, they were employed in depth in that last sequence, but, however graceful and narrow, the ensemble continues to transmit a somewhat childish sensation.
A fairly regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to devote the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional free day.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea - it would fit - in the party's plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a week of four days has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
Just as a high-ranking Labour Party commented on The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
\"It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party\"
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not part of the party’s policy and is not going to be discussed at the moment”
The Minister of Finance in the Shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was willing to regain the powers of, and, at the expense of, companies providing public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover their full participation, since a labor government could apply deductions corresponding to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive property funds in which 10 % of private sector companies' shares are to be allocated to employees, which would lead to annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in -60 Minutes - about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put forward at least one week's final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge and also raises the question of whether the results that are concluded might influence a Republican senator who eventually decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, the journalist, -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
\"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
It was shown firm, resolved, tactless —
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
\"I've already made a decision around Brett Kavanaugh and I'd overlook the accusation,\" he said.
\"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star cartel meets for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to the Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or -actions - as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved when it reached its goal for 12 years?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the so-called \"clictivism\" which is called the stance we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favour of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed to have world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which, have already been paid or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom with a common commitment to help children grow and develop their full potential. To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4500 tweets from Global Citizens collaborators.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador to “The Power of Nutrition” to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a collaborator of Global Citizen responded: \"It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as we have already achieved earlier human rights movements and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we'll count on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretariat
\"If necessary - Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the hands of legitimate government, is but a pretext for expansion into new markets.
\"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the largest supplier in southern Europe,\" he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
\"The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the \"speaker of the energy consumer\" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
\"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,\" he also warned that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve Russia of its role, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the \"inappropriate\" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which amounts to $11 billion and intends to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington's fervent opposition to the project responds only for economic reasons and is a further example of unfair competition.
\"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,\" said Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the United States Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The American stance has, however, been met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It poses a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a meeting that was held recently between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of running for the presidency in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the elections in mid-term.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being addressed.
\"It's time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally to have women among the leaders,\" The Hill said.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Hall and said that \"he was taking the country along the wrong path\"
\"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,\" he said.
Warren spoke without tapestry about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that - it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote -
On Thursday a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58% of the voting potentials in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not appear, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible application for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as reported by the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's posttraumatic stress disorder in a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
\"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since his return, knows him very well the other families who suffer from the effects of the PTSD and other injuries with which our soldiers are returning,\" said the public that he congregated himself in a rally in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented about his son and other war veterans who - they return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is such respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country -
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence towards a woman, who interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support judicial recourse to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a \"friendly\" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been revealed in the case - Grace v. Sessions - which in August presented the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said that his partner - and his children, who are members of a violent gang - abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday stating that the new policy - ignored decades of international, federal and state law -
\"According to federal legislation, all applications for asylum must be failed by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the application and, on the other hand, this exception infringes that principle\" is indicated in the friendly curiae.
Also, lawyers indicated in the writing that the policy that denied entry to immigrants harms the US economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and - suppose a necessary workforce -
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin on grounds of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” said Sessions when it announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum has never been created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people are facing every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly distressing.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce -
Some residents have returned to their homes destroyed to search among the few drowned belongings left to them in an effort to recover as much as possible.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals are also damaged because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, they are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who had the back and a broken shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous replicas, also very strong.
He could not help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake that he lived while he was at the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
- We didn't have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the fallen wall, I think - Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
\"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of making \"bulling\" with propaganda advertisements
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to the payment supplement of China Daily in Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, something China strongly denies.
The accusation that Trump launched about Beijing's attempt to influence the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials pointed out to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington-led campaign to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both parties.
China's compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall within the exporters of states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the previous governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China - is further intensifying that pressure with advertising publications in our free press -
“In an attempt to spread its propaganda, the government of China is worth the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, in the kiosk of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that - one of the most relevant newspapers in China avoided the offer of publishing - his article, although he did not specify which newspaper was being dealt with.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-term vote with Kavanaugh's debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlog, especially by women, may occur in the next mid-term votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to proceed with the vote.
“In this type of business it is not possible to go back,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher claimed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to stand in favour of the FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the voters disgusted with this matter.
\"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it tomorrow or November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the movementon progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters gathered at the Senate's gates were toppled - November is to come - (November will soon come!) at the time when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes out of every forecast,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst at the news site.
People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, so it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided women in the suburbs and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who don't usually vote even if they don't like the president.
Even prior to Ford's public testimony in which his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate were fully detailed, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans continued with confirmation.
\"This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,\" said Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"It's not just a matter of the committee's vote or the final vote, not even if they sit on the bench in Kavanaugh; it's also about the way Republicans have handled all this and how they've treated it,\" said news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on the side of the latter.
In a new survey of YouGov, it is indicated that 41% of respondents definitively or probablely believe Ford's testimony, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or probablely.
In addition, 38 % claimed that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same thing to Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her and was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitalia at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is about to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is -to dominate the world -
\"It has to be now,\" he said about the startup.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own — online personal data storage — or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique in the storage of personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it \"personal training through data\"
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to -Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all his business models are completely modified from one day to another.
- We're not asking for permission.
In a publication at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that - his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite being even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew they had granted him the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was - of a special symbolism - that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal - through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and guns -
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the \"greater courage\" he made the line forward before reaching a cannon with one hand and down to three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed him by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he performed his grandfather were so great that I could never get to his height, but they were very exciting.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which had the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, \"It was all a privilege for him to be part of the parade,\" and he added, \"the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such numerous backing.\"
MMA's followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see all the Bellator 206 so that in the end you won't be allowed to see the main event.
The cartel of San José had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was going to broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m. just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face up, the United Kingdom viewers were amazed when the program changed Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having had to stay awake until early in the morning just to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change to cartoons as \"a heavy joke\"
“There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when we asked him about the transmission.
- Peppa the cerdita - yes -
The company president Bellator, Scott Coker, said they are going to modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
\"When I think about the streaming option, I think it can work,\" Coker said.
\"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all of them were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us that he did not realize until he came to high school that - not all were like me -
In the first programme of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention to speak about gay rights was to transmit hope to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made it more important to gain in the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, is going to be missing a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first programme, Daley, who showed himself to be a marginalized, commented that he felt - inferior - to the rest during his childhood, because - it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls -
He said: \"To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to triumph\"
He wanted to show that he was — something — said so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used in this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass that hope on to others.
Three times the world champion declared that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year with the winner of an Oscar, who has been 20 years old, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
\"When you live so long from a young age\" (it was at your first 14-year-old Olympics and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same high and low as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that their global perspective had changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal',\" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is definitely Robbie -
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and in fact one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be in the first row,\" she said.
\"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn't invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
\"At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed all my life: to compete in the pool in front of mine in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better,\" he said.
This fact was also what inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, who accompanied him in the stage of preparation for the Olympic Games. He was still put on chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his shape if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event that was held every two years to get a record for 12th time, was disbanded by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and ovens on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so many times done for the United States, the five times major tournament champion had to settle with cheering at a time and, at other times, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough continually punishes with wrong strokes.
And, if the camp is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth party on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed trust in his partner, he couldn't say much more.
\"He understood the role he had today, he slapped me in the back and, rolling around with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
\"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine it playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them--
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 cattle, 20 lost and 7 equal, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
\"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to mock others; it's great to have it on the team,\" he explained.
“I think the younger players have loved to have it as support, too this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just game-
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even though he enters with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a band headed by Seven Ballesters maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to beat the others by weighing the heels for a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Don’t stop reminding yourself that we made a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and lost it, we did it in Valderrama and we won it, but for very little,” Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to accomplish, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of what's on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world --
Proud of what their players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: \"I don't want to move forward.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test all your skills as a golfer.
That's the message to be conveyed to players, to get the best out of one tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner behind, go and get the best out of yourself —
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do it better individually than they did as couples, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brookline and then lost when Europe carried out the “Millage of Medinah”
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super important matches tomorrow, but we have to boot as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure lies in those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow -
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour,” Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new fragata of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, the local media reported.
The delivery of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" - the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement by a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery hampered the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bukes missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very small acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power overseas) to be outdated by the time they start serving, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial software and hardware defects that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the personnel in the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €31 billion ($36 billion), rather than the initial € 22 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is - leaving without ships capable of deploying -
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships have been discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything we find is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the coastal bats of Daubenton and long ear browns of the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been considerably reduced in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind,
but, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the subject of the bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts on the subject, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reservation dedicated to bats of Scotland in the state of Treave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Three, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.
It emphasizes the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean the annihilation of a local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, \"We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species we don't know how their populations evolve.\"
Ronaldo denies rape complaints while his lawyers persecute the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued rape complaints as \"fake news\" and says that people - they want to get to know each other - at the expense of their name.
Their lawyers have received instructions to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were issued.
In front of Portugal and Juventus he is accused of violating an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying him $375 000 to hide the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, tagged the story as \"fake news\"
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false - says the five times winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to make themselves famous just to mention me, but that's right, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine - added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit with Der Spiegel on charges that appear in what they have called an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions, as Reuters reports.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to get compensation for - moral damages for a amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of his personal rights in recent years -
Apparently, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her on an annual basis, according to the documents registered at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a 99 percent, a \"good boy,\" and that he had let down that one percent, remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and that he took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later he agreed to come to an extrajudicial settlement because he had - a terror in the reprisals - and he was concerned - to be humiliated in public -
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to cancel the agreement, as she was still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom - would regret all its life - if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of automobiles after Brexit, said the Secretary of Industry, Greg Clark.
He added that it was - worrying - that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily be stopped at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
\"We need an agreement,\" said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays on customs in the case of an unintended Brexit could lead to loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production pairs in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about exiting the EU without an agreement, particularly with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which car manufacturers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (just in time) where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture cars for commissioning.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom left the European Union without an agreement, an interruption could occur on the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and decommissioning of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May, where future relations with the EU are established, is - precisely designed to avoid those controls in border crossings -
\"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get off the step right now but we have to take the opportunity,\" said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidences of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, are that we have to be able to continue with what has so far been a tremendously successful supply chain”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesperson said: \"We have put in place a precise and convincing plan on which our future relations with the EU are bound\"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Vice-President-General Rod Rosenstein could, as the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to dismiss the deputy general officer or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fuelled Washington's cutlery for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself carried to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said that \"I would rather not - say goodbye to Rosenstein but the meeting had to postpone to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: \"No date has been defined, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will report to the press, as soil to do -
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting in greatvolved, although he said: \"I did not disagree with the fact that they were boasting.\"
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
\"The president performs more questions and answers than any other president before him,\" he said, while quoting without evidence: \"We have contrasted those numbers.\"
Press releases will continue to take place, Sanders said, but -if the press has the option of asking the president of the United States directly, I think it is much better than doing them to me.
We have tried to do it many times and have seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States -
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press wheels with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him occur only on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why he was like that, where he made an angry appearance and, sometimes bizarre, before the journalists who were gathered there.
State Health Secretariat writes EU workers in NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The State Health Secretariat has written to the EU staff working at the HHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of EU citizens' requests for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which the expected decisions were made this fall were followed.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefit patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is, no doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you.
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, player of the Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically intervened in emergency after suffering a head wound last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the breakup.
“I came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a camel and leading it to a thorough examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that -- there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused -- and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.

Foreigners will be charged a tax on the transmission of higher estates when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be charged a tax on the transmission of higher estates when they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected with this measure will be used to cover the (without roof) according to the new plans of the conservators
Change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the tax on the transmission of holdings shall be imposed on persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasure hopes to raise up to £120 million a year that will be allocated to the - homeless -
The additional money collected with the increase in the tax on the transmission of estates to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will be allocated to aid to the - homeless - announced today Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and bullies to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the tax on the transmission of farms will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also including the rise in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the “buy-to-let” system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasure hopes to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, resulting in rising prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the most suitable areas in the country (especially in the capital) have become “phantom cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy arrives just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining very high prices on the estates by buying eagerly land without using it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas applied to affordable housing to solve the \" shameful housing problem\" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of evictions without cause.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: \"Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real -
Jack Ross: \"My primary goal is to lead Scotland\"
The trainer of Sunderland says that his \"prime objective\" is to become a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman was thrilled to see the possibility of revitalizing the northeast club, which now occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of leagues of England), three points from the first.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I just got a B cap — Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
\"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I succeed in leading a successful club -
Ross' predecessors as leader of the Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic says that he felt no fear when he went to such names established at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"At this moment, success for me is measured as to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League,\" he said.
\"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it should be.\"
Ross has only been exercising as a coach for three years, after a while as an assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
Later, he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren come from being on the edge of the descent to win the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
\"It was probably a real crossroads,\" he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
\"I always thought management was the best thing I could do, much more than play.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a living very well with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while the profits of the restaurants dropped by 4.8%, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA company consultancy, which was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the World have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8 % in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of beverages rose to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the domestic business market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the fall of 4.8 % in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continued pressure on costs.
The long and warm summer could not have come at the worst for gastronomy operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implantations.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK’s restaurant, bar and pubs sector, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined billing of over £ 9 billion and is the market reference value.
One out of five children have secret accounts on social media behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted at 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth on Instagram fake pages
The news has heightened the fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students said they had a \"principal\" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create accounts on social media that conceal adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in Instagram's fake accounts, a reference site for photo sharing.
The news has heightened the fears that sexual content will be published.
Some 20% of the students said they had a primary, healthy account that showed their parents, while others had private ones.
A mother who happened to find herself with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how one teenager encouraged others to \"violate me\"
The investigation, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters - and Headmasters - Conference (HMC) of independent colleges, found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘Athletes' voice’ in Scotland’s athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be a member of the Scottish athletic federation directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete on track and field in Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from their great international experience in the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from relying on it in its directive,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, \"I like to be the athlete's spokesman and I hope I can contribute things and help develop sport in Scotland.\"
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular BBC expert, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would do it.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.

The advertisement of the scarf where compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A scam company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with cows to those who milk.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the “first silent news outlets of the world” the technology company for the consumer Elvie published an announcement inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music where it is shown to mothers who count the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a hay-filled barn in the way of dance rink, along with some cows, with letters like: \"Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have tail\" and \"If you haven't noticed, they're not open, they're my breasts\"
The choir keeps saying, \"Sort them, order them, I'm feeding your babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women.\"
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created a major controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is successful to focus on the \"horrors\" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take away their babies days after they have been given birth, one person wrote.
Elvie milk extractor adapts discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: \"Troumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies -
Another comment was: \"There's a more unscavoured ad\"
Other people, however, defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song proved to be - destabilizing -
- I think that's a great idea.
If I still sucked, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a bit allocated, but I don't give it any more.
It's a product genius - a woman told us.
Another person told us: “It’s a funny announcement to mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement neither the dairy sector is praised nor judged -
At the end of the video, the women's group show that they've been dancing with the discrete bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who get milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly docks within the nursing bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the running pump.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD, comments: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we intended to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding bombs and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a entertaining and near manner the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant minors quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of minors detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx on the border has practically remained at the usual levels. Partly, this is because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are making it difficult for these children to adhere to.
Traditionally, most of the godfathers, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the proposal to welcome a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential godfathers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high office of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to adhere to unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no criminal record.
About 80 per cent of the sponsors or their relatives are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute the nearest minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers in the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not consider themselves fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent kidnapping or attempts to escape.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where the signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
Moreover, moving to camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the issue - it will be dealt with accordingly -
\"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,\" he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the \"war on terrorism\" has almost ended in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue - fighting in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories - from both terrorist groups and -any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 earthly soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were given for returning and blaming - some Western countries - for - seeming irrational fears - that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
\"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.\"
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had a clear \"places\" and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the Jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy from the UN, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted - to review the articles of the current constitution - and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a dismissal or a scandal will prematurely end his presidency.
This would certainly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen.
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak hourly indexes have doubled to 1.05 million for the CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at maximum audience time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and -The Rachel Maddow Show - from MSNBC has exceeded cable channel rates with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
\"It's a strange attraction that we still can't understand,\" comments Neal Baer, author-producer of \"Designed Survivor,\" a dramatic ABC series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip that he did in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why, he asked.
\"Because it makes me laugh,\" said Scovell.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the sources of \"deep background\" that Bob Woodward used for his book -Fear - the $15,000 ostrich leather hunter from Paul Manafort - a proud garment - in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the grim descriptions of Stormy Daniels' anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” when he talks to us about the alternating division of Trump’s show and his daily plot twists (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house seeing MSNBC at the same time as recording CNN.
He could not take off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
\"I remember when in those days we were doing all these program madnesss and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" Fleiss says.
\"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right\"

Foreign money flows in the most tight half-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising the influx of money that is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district of Congress with two candidates looking for re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former District 12 of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The career for the new 17 has sparked a funding contest for campaigns between the major financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (CNCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered to penalise El Salvador for its support to China, although after throwing back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had an affable meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners dislodged to the Trump Organization's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to bring back the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid from about 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was that the conference should continue, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is planning to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three United States envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House in Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the special lawyer Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public registry.
Mueller is also thought to be taking this investigation into the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just when he prepares to come before the voters again, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of parole, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a coup against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Vice-Fiscal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has seen himself in a good way since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
\"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will encounter a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we'll fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how will I not be optimistic about our future -

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic at the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against the Villarreal early in the month, will place them in a strong position to rank themselves in Group G of the League Europe.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting his first appearance from the season to the 2-2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
\"We can get a good score, as the Villarreal is a good team,\" said 31-year-old player.
We started the party by believing that we could get something and go out with a point.
Perhaps we could have won the victory at the end, but in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for everyone and we were the best team.
We'll have another big European night this Thursday.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous match. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the kids are enjoying a lot and we're having a good workout.
I have the hope that we will be able to move forward, to leave behind last season and achieve success -
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
\"People want to take care of a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation,\" says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in sufficient time.
Work with your counselor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a cost factor.
It incorporates in conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or secure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: proceed to legal battles.
Be responsible for obtaining a health care power to designate a trusted person to supervise his or her medical care and ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes in case he or she is unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his bills are paid if he is incapacitated.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regencia, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatal victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, provoked on 26 December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. Over half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of deadly victims on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and resulted in a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatal casualties.

Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, aged 29 and a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by Alaskan state police.
According to that police report, when a well-known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin has been sentenced to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is retained with an unsecured 500-dollar bond, KTU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared “definitely innocent” when his statement was requested, he reported the chain.
Palin faces three Class A minor offences, which means he could spend up to one year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor class B offence, one day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of interfering with the complaint of a crime of domestic violence and of possessing a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed she punched him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatal victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had met for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are exceptionally looking for the death penalty for terrorist attack suspect in New York
New York federal prosecutors are looking for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway of Bajo Manhattan, overthrowing pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of the intent to apply for a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
Both charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed with Saipov a charge of 22 charges that included eight organized crime-assisted murder charges, usually using federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required - substantial planning and premeditation - according to prosecutors, describing the way Saipov carried it out as -atroz, cruel and depraved -
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco — is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be removed in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared himself not to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender lawyers representing Saipov, said that they are, of course, disappointed with the decision of the prosecution.
\"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with life sentence without release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,\" Patton said.
The Saipov Defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised - to move the popular army - today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to - feel the heat - of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham's concentration that the United Kingdom would have gone out if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided ranks has further highlighted when a group of Tories in favour of the stay have joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the plan of the compromise signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of Brexit supporters, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the \"caos\"
Member Bone said in the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, we'd have gone out,\" he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: \"I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers -
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: \"We have not fought in world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country -
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where he told reporters: \"I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who go out to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening -
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises.
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to make - feel the heat - to the politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's a question of trust between us, people, and our political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're here to tell them that we won't let them get away with it.\"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: \"I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
\"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom\"
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay traveled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
\"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for the border in harmony, for free borderless trade in Ireland,\" he added.
- It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit - he added.
Warren considers all possibilities to be presented for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will consider all possibilities of presenting himself for the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chair of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
Much has been speculated about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the electors using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to appear for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for the women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes that there is a woman at the highest level.
One arrested for the firearm murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for shooting death at Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the LSU last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that ultimately led to his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon, and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a player from Baton Rouge from 198 meters high, played in 32 games last season, being held on 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton in the forget by defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxes and let Hamilton run in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with force one lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with the nearly glued wheels that caused Ferrari's pilot to reluctantly leave the free interior at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself on the third bend.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started from the last row of the grill and got into the seventh square at the end of the first round.
He later led a large part of the race while clinging to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxes on turn 44, but he could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen the fourth position.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple,” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but he commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are — sick, disgusting and false —
\"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,\" he said.
\"When you read the publications and the leaks, then they say, \"But if I didn't.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it.
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked it - he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was coming from his office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter her story,\" said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep it confidential and therefore I did it.\"
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who said during the Saturday night's rally: \"I'll tell you one thing: that's a really bad body language.\"
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen —
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court's appointment, which had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and revulsion, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit to gain power and control, said the president as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored Giant leadership.
Francois Bouchard matched for the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal arrived in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to a assistance from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided assistance to have Beauvillier double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan re-puted the local team with a desire to play in the minutes 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match at 4:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a goose in minutes 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the leadership for the first time in the party when the end of the second part arrived and secured victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home before Milton Keynes in his next Friday match.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people managed to safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to strike the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post on the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. That tower was affected by a strong swing.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
\"Our hearts break when we hear this,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is believed to continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman, comments.
A few waves up to six metres have devastated Palu, who will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “An ambulance with more bodies comes every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse —
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
They're ready, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely to the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be counted.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The authorities said on Friday that they had moved seven people to a hospital..
The airline said six passengers were on Saturday at the hospital and everyone was in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had exceeded the landing runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s something extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that would reach their waist to the emergency exits of the aircraft that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were doing work to improve a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under the water.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the filing of her arguments on Saturday at the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury the way he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went upstairs on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was -- lying, because my truck was in Nashville --
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
“He wiped her out of her life,” Hale said.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would remain in the hands of the jury that very day.

Another black person?
A New York Nanny asks a couple to dismiss her after a racist text
A Nanny from New York is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she misreceived a text message from the mother complaining that she was - another black person -
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with a case of — extortion —
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dismay at discovering that the new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSONS” wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Maurice twice.
After realizing his leg stitching, a \"uncomfortable\" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and instead expected a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and sent her home to Uber.
Maurice is now asking the couple for compensation for dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 per day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, even without a contract.
\"I want to show you that things are not done like this,\" The Post said on Friday and added, \"I know it's a case of discrimination.\"
The couple responded to claims that they were racist saying that the completion of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife had sent him something I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists - said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
\"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on.
Comparing demand as a - extortion - Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that he was in a - very difficult situation -
\"Are you going to go for someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing - he added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was difficult to get into the place of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It's so nice to know now what we know about Paddington's great success -
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera, had previously been inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something - agridulce - after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as - a very important member of our family - she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
\"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to boast,\" he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you are proud of him, even if it is not really your credit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself -
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When he landed, his daughter was urgently moved to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
\"Nothing regularly called to say that the situation was really wrong, that it was not expected to succeed,\" Mrs. Ednan-Lapere said.
\"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready for you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep the pumping of his heart slowly drained and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was turning off.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't climb, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperese, now suffering from her daughter's loss, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers, outside the terrible experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
I hid my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her.
Women in mourning put up cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day,\" he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
\"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: \"I am continually concerned that it may have an impact\"
Davis created the cards - so people know that there are people you can come to and with whom you can talk, even if he's a friend.
Don't feel quiet, you have to talk to him.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
\"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything,\" he says.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them.
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: \"Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread at the time the FBI starts the investigation
\"I thought if we really could get something like what I was asking for (a limited research in time, of limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,\" said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be (taking a pick) in the midst of a partisan paralysing.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the mid-term elections, on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI issues its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The figures of deserters in North Korea - now - with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
The vast majority of deserters in the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border over 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DDZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed generally to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without the confidence of the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls \"hysterical\" Brett Kavanaugh and says he's not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a \"hysterical\" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was thrilled to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and teasing while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , calling the charges against them \"grotesque and clearly coordinated , organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his view, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
\"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,\" he said.
Pelosi objected when asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, it won't be fit just to be in the Supreme Court, it won't even be them to be in the court in which he now exercises,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgements against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and hope that we feel that everything is all right,” Pelosi said.
And the women have to push him.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
\"We'll cry when we get angry,\" Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
\"I don't think that's so weird, do I?\"
She kept saying, \"A woman who was executive in some company helped me a lot and said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: \"You think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry.
And then I followed what I was doing.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once that I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cogotum and dragged me to a staircase.
\"Don't let them never see you cry,\" he said.
\"You have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extra-marital adventure aboard a boat called Monkey Business for which he had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, was told that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself presented herself for the presidency.
\"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision,\" he said in laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the seven dwarfs -
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000, she was only given $250.
\"They think I have a discount,\" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by the emotions (gratitude by the people who had supported it, frustration by a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the seizure of voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), which he attracted.
“The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put in my tombstone?

The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much left to complete the battle, a breakup between countries could benefit Beijing, experts think.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $20 billion ($15 billion) in products, which charges taxes to half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying tariffs from five to ten percent to US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to equalizing the U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon collapse.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to lawsuits, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions for starting a drop in the economy in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia’s issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a war-torn country that has been going on for more than seven years.
In an earlier speech by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to abandon it due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already given.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help of rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is made with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, off the outskirts of Paris (France).
The United States has now had six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his point of departure to the water in hole 16 pair 3, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 before Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already wears eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
\"I don't cry, but today I can't help it.\"
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I was able to get the drink back.
It is a achievement of the whole team and I am very glad I have been able to help - said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
Now the torch passes to his compatriot John Rahm, who has already defeated on Sunday the legend of US golf Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual game.
“I feel an incredible pride in having conquered Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, staying only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: \"I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated the situation in Europe.
But let's get him lost.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
We've been out of our way.
