The remaining people of UKIP who refuse to live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use special arguments, and then you disagree with them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to tail after chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing cingels, does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation taken from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence has a lot of surprise, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to manage to give yourself back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken because contrary to Farage and his clumsy disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is also rotten in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity, there will be nothing arranged.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the 'EUROPE TIGRE' we boasted, a few years ago.
We met later!
This is starting to re-read the article.
We are trying to make it believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE''' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, impotent on the lowest companies in Europe, a smooth work process, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what ''pavoir'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, the Irlance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese, considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on account of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the impotments actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full costs.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and dear) cars all corners of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been evident in the daily caps since my arrival.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon explode.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bags and scratches on the elders will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm stealing with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once it's re-built.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair have to pay passengers a supplement for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them with?
But without these kinds of Irish businesses, you can't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give each other joy.
Any item on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something else that the basic rate only has to take on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is in large part pedestrian, and literally grouille of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the White Manteaux Space Magazine Salon (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, world drunk with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right which, except for exceptions, benefits the employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy nor the minister in charge of foreign affairs have the slightest power to reform the labour code.
Then they lock it up.
What does the law do?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday Apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
And if his daughter's succession was, against her will, to use to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
Surely his succession would want his share of the cake if you gave me the expression.
His preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish civil war...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he held the lead of the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a \"agreement\" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting Fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect money from inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure constructions are by no means renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true francai evil: the distrust of dialogue
Return to the princely values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his assistance, or he has the right in exchange for the services he renders or has given to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives from the income of his property.
There is a need to differentiate the one who invests for a return to his retirement and the one who lives from his pension.
A property to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
Finance's little genius lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, that is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so no new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of the decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energetic shock less harsh, then the need for investment is rising: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc.
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a cockroach.
Samsung's profits are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple's benefit.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft established this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for \"a better platform\".
Are there \"a better car manufacturer\", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a booming mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
This is of our interest to all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you're looking for and it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on the other hand, on Parisians) could tell us which authors they fight ideas about the genre and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Active Values?
Are their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato referring to Holopherne, a rapprochement that didn't come to me (I don't have her vividness of mind).
Otherwise, in the background - since you're going there, I'm not interested in this subject, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends might get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith to Holopherne, that is.
Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us feedback.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second in qualifying Judith Butler as a very symbolic gorge trench.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their home.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I intend to fight ideas from the only exposure made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologist) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuances.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slicer of throat, I was content with the \"Second Sex\" (it was more of my time) that is I believe the source of \"the source\" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having cloud-locked view.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really seal the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its real colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne, so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Meteorological Rain of the Perseides and for virtually all major astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything in the sky.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, although things greatly improve on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will you obsess when it ends (strongly) by disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accusing them of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars's going into a collision with Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The other liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenue: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet these are the examples to be followed.
Notary reform would result in a claim for compensation amounting to EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economic Affairs claims that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What about the Department of Economics' error?
Will decision makers have the same courage when submitting the bill to the state budget as a result of the courageous attack of notaries?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in the management of its budget because the state's temporal horizon is theoretically infinite while the household's horizon is dulled by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and immaterial investments in future growth and therefore future revenue.
A few elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical societies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands linked by law as written by policies.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the educated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health system to look like the United States, you should learn how it works.
Around the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to put the fault on the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and \"research\".
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as differences from one country to another on what is for free sale or only on order.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that slow them down and the onerous permit needed.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who achieve a good quality product version at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on in the backstage for doctors and pharmacies.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't get any patents on grass...
If \"researchers\" in social sciences were doing research instead of politics and networking, their \"work\" could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Compare it isn't looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
You can't say \"the research is done you have to apply it\" and then in the same jet \"we have to experiment to everything goes\".
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research is not completed why do you ask us to apply them?
Can I be told how a \"researcher\" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they are not able to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory.
What's the use of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on for you, a self-promoting will, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to get away from training sophists and ideologists, and to be taught by practitioners.
factory reread the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion motivates us to the most ineffective conservatism: \"It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of current practices, and does not allow the system to progress \".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
To give more weight to theorists of education would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally fierce: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like to have myself operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the taste.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright, I'll just have to read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same because they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive the artists of their bread.
You can always discuss pedant assumptions - but it's flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
It's obviously not bothering you to deprive the artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed by a click.
Perhaps if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for having violated the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource we rejoined, the streamer who says it's all wrong....
If it is a PS Member who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from there.
France pulls people down as assistants all the time.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down, these are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in a private company ever since.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am employed because I know that I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null patterns I meet frequently.
At ease in my basketballs I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the awful truth!
@gus, if you compare with the German companies that the French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany, companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What are the French bosses waiting to do the same???
May the state hold their hand?
This state that they are accused of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your side!
Remind me, that you created yourself as a job, as an added value, to be so strict?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are moving and undermining while waiting for the state's permanent assistance!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' fees, taxes, work 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, marching on eggs, dare to claim the reduction of wages or their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the \"negative\" comments on this subject.
What's ironic about the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat instead of turning.
It doesn't mean that Scottish railways haven't improved since Last takes care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But, the Labour's gonna piss us off, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the United Kingdom from creating a more morale enterprise and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated it to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help themselves across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be pleased with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on good track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
\"She was a beating girl.\"
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that the fact of being \"beating\" is a quality that is superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening to it, for example, the fact of being \"beating\" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous - beating - who are no less dead, I know of the palanqués.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start over, too.
I'm not telling you that it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you that it helps..
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When you have examples of your life, only you can judge them.
I'll be right back.
Insinuating, it would only be a moment, that we can have merit to get out of a disease or that we can demerit ourselves from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I am happy to think otherwise, if, having a strong moral, it is likely that we can accept more easily heavy treatment and prepare for it, try experimental treatments like this woman did, and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first of all someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to give it back to the Lord, it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch dirt, a real one, you're stripping yourself to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two, dirty, big, and if I hit myself, as psychologists say, it totally escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to shut the teeth, suffer the hell and cash the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A birthday's forgotten.
His trial was conducted \"quickly\" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the Rule of International Law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed up by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign State which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was positively recognized by the Western States who then lied to the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the day.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we do not like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that is about to go around, measuring the level of piezoelectricity in the quartz.
This kind of study is unquestionably useful and thank you for letting us share the results.
One hope, therefore, but the caution is that this water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be \"the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules\", according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine team of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to come.
Thank you Passer de ciencias to give us often of these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals (in advance) be?
No doubt through the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of a earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has a priori odor for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments available to him.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report relating to the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work that dealt with the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more specifically to their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or is it about these researches?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should relearn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the \"signs\" given by the animals, we hit the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to get himself elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, isn't it?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in \"Have I Got News For You\".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories popularity rating will crack the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what we used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the blinker, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the penalty to read a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the \"Solomon\" and the \"treasure of iron\" speak, as sadly as the dead who stayed there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be at the bottom of it since the battle of Savo) did not want to go back there.
We are actually passed before the island of Savo, in the \"Iron Bottom Sound\".
Even though the mission is about to end.
It's the little ones.
But the echoo side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerosene consumes to achieve the goal completely decredibles the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors that philanthropes.
An operation of how much more he didn't do or do.
The cow, it makes too much desire!!!
I look forward to the webseries!
Your story reminds me, by identifying me a little in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Ellorn Crocos at the White Moulin in Brest!).
Also hat for the ecological message, even though some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think that the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies should not spend a lot of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers even as nice as these!
Are there players in the current Serbian training who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
It's Bisevac, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez, who, under the supervision of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful teamman of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he showed up on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *fried*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as much as I know he's not a licensee.
Could he still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (that I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give country ends to neighbouring countries.
How could one have felt - an explosion of joy - seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How??
What bothers me a little in this \"testimonial\" is that the only fact that I could, would only once, be spontaneously rejoicing over the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a person's-fitting line, whose all the \"temos\" should be taken with the greatest inspection.
No doubt in the short moment of joy, we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will just be thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalypticly evil to the wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were horrified by their sense of humiliation.
With evidence filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfrede.
We doubted that.
The West - Christian/White/Gaulois - cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the faubourges of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
Last splendor, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigotism of existing powers and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the gel of thought and excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, must not cause Muslims to recede.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose it's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The particular campaign is to cut the breath in the fall.
Not as much to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We've had a great summer this year, don't make your grinches that rake clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of exciting smells, with a febriality that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of drowning and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child enhancements , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from Deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households having seen their tax increase following this measure , it is mainly the 4 and 5 deciles that are concerned ( median income ) according to Graph 2 .
The elimination of half of the part concerning mainly widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under assessment: 230M of euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understands that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on straw, right, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a policy rather left we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Continue this way and you will encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you look bad at what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the value of money is exceeded, money is no longer used to make money, that is to say, to do the worst of the numbers.
We're one of the 20 percent richest.
No doubt also 20% of the households that work the most (and create wealth whose part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or even lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of red Khmer head cutters have lived happily.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In either, we had things that we would not have had in a 5 star hotel and we did not have to introduce ourselves to the reception or face any worries.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, put it back and leave.
This will now be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, the people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a type of owner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
\"It's very dangerous and highly risky\" It's not true.
You've just really missed your chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, based on an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why is Teman quoted in this article as complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who've already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a bill and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
\"Supporting the Troops,\" the Bu$herie sang on every tone...
Inoffensive weapons, then.
I am sure this will please the families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Hussein saddam.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Furthermore, how could this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: \"in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We all agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
It is never time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were \"worked\" 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And let's not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen as the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, internet connection, nor supplies.
Besides, it's so much the board at 5:00 a.m. and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill up the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to grow up with uneducated clards whose parents spit on you by treating you like a butcher?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the population of khurde can better grow.
Where we see that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything through.
My first job as a graduate was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a London subway worker, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not do this if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well, or you like to do it.
If I had stayed at the job graduates, I'd still be paying for my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL This item is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year delay.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bious channels such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what are called the diplomas of unemployed people.
I have one of these diplomas and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting wage was lower, but the steps are quickly raised because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate studies engineering / artistic channels have lasted for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Are letters, philosophy and art booning?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about some kind of media studies or whatever the way you went.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better to have a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I can't see the inhabitants of the bottom of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km back every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intramuros and small belts already have many other ways of transport in common (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secured and locked parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
It is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
As well as enjoying their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When discussing with pedestrians and other transport users in common reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and get away with the survival of bicycles 2/ you get full pollution in the head For me the cycle tracks are pis going, you have to reduce traffic (urban type congestion load), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the road code by systematically speaking (even the bikes to bemol before you need to adapt the code of the road written for baths 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer areas after the closed passage, not before the baths and scooters do not grow.
The cycle paths are apartheid, it is necessary to cohabit but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transportation?
EELV's right.
The goal of 15% speed travel is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe Anne Hidalgo drove the greens into the flour.
In addition to learning what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptic.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I'm not sure how to love the way the world evolves.
It looks terrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be dismissed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been previously shot down, Ukraine launched in the area of air strikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Government of Ukraine taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents to have airlines pay overland rights?
Where are all pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / the ultranationalists of western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in bulk that Putin has shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance Russia would let this case go to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far the investigators have not said anything like that.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly, it's distressing!
Calling Polar is losing the north is exciting.
A single question: Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most viciously haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have decreased the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I wonder how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's capacity for concentration has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is just or not.
If it is fair, it can be debated without reading the book which is essentially to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of its paving summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I trust the summary of his central thesis and it is the one that seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not overall enriched itself?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17.
A age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope this price will not be a burden for the girl and she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the perverted colored are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Is Malala herself not part of these \"perverted colored\"?
You should not have \"antenna time\" on this site.
You're a terrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and that she has the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, insofar as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at the age of 14 without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't spell it out in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14
Rather disappointed by this entry on season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a bit of trouble finding her son-in-law from Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to the perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronic Life on Mars de Bowie is simply overturning.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden to look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, outside Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of scenes and mountings that helped me.
In AHS we have an avalanche of original plans that does not ridicule the asepticization of today's productions.
I'm running away a little bit from seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting for the quality of the sponge.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series closes by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours of time.
But everyone does what they want, right?
That's why I say \"I won't look later\" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view no more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut the state spending instead.
No, let's increase spending, please.
Those who wanted to know in the spending have failed.
Initiate controversy over relatively small expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change in orientation that voters seem to call for their wishes and during all this time some in each camp seem to see that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The \"debt\" is mainly of assets held by financial institutions in that country.
The \"debt\" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government getting a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would use it as a good incentive.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind turbine subsidies and nuclear power plants that double what they should be, you come up with a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car sticker, and it's before the VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car stickers.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it is not important to know where billions of tax books go.
How can an unemployed person who looks for work at the door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look for it, which means 80% of them are looking for and can't find it.
As an unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of all.
I haven't had any news from Pôle Emploi in months, does that mean that the officers are more busy in control operations than actually getting job announcements?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment doesn't provide enough jobs, then we need to get out of Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case it is ensured that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to the users of a means of transport, a service manager or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had business with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, 40 percent amputated, it had to be fought firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The check-in and check-up is currently taking over, while the statutory Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, who pay the costs.
Policies and non-salaried French people give themselves rights that they do not in fact have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance is involved in increasing the value of paid labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hadj at Mecca this year on Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their application for a visa denied because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the smallpox to Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it to be heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those \"knowing\" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be quarantined strictly.
Nobody gets out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they hire the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took \"all necessary precautions\".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
May it happen to pass the message of the first individual and of the second (including religious) group and it will have earned the Nobel Peace.
I doubt that it is capable of making up the image of God in dogma characterized by the total barks of the planet in operation.
He's still far from that design here.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given prize of humanity, while religion, which comes from the beervelet, may be leading our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet in the Church, there is only to see the few Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too -anxyogen -
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will make it possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see before the christ.
Hillel a century before he had already said: \"Don't do to others what you don't want us to do to you, that's where all the Torah is and the rest is just a comment: go and study.\"
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agapê.
Do you - make progress in righteousness, peace, fraternity - but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who upset the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and make progress in justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the few Protestants in France are mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new game Alien, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes out soon.
It doesn't make up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount bonus.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount bonus.
I'll check it out.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all sympas sites.
Hello, is this £30 then 20% reduction, or does the £30 include 20% reduction?
However, the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat pump and all: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'd erase it from your library if they decided to sevir against the people who buy it there while they're out of the region that they're planning.

So, France of 1940 was a rotten lander?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
It must be loved by France of 40, that of - the strange defeat -
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso has only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, do not worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano of fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, the terrible ones.
Since I led one to Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing's followed me this far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or riding me like Superman III's awful computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days' rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer party and the Nottingham cider.
It was brothels.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorite.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fans of CAMRA (not to confuse with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving back Sunday was really tough.
On Monday night we went to the grandpa's home to play the card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner I was able to leave with several decent dishes.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a piece of larceny on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're moving a little further away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's signaling arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that we access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental countersensions: the whole of the authorities, organizations or associations representative, Muslim or non-Muslim, having formally condemned the II and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
I don't say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the crime of French society.
If there is no doubt, so to speak.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
Allow close contact with IE or the IE conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to domesticate the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, \"revenge\" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has crept between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified by the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland since they have no seats.
They can do what they want in all electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good thing in the long term for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to give a tear to the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the \"PROMESSE\" thinking he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leader for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Switching pumps by 8% to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs can no longer vote on the issues of England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it did him well.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and has since won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in general, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is \"The Life of Others\" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least one sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay like the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, it remains to me the reading of pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a fly.
In view of the price I paid Kobo, it is without regret.
I am sorry for the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your public bookstore, you will notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably risky.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same loop.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is not able to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a class of maternals full of acid-treated schizophrene children.
It's even worse if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to take a bullet in the foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it's actually a bullet in her foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: \"The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be an error in seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent a serious warning of retaliation there or if it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.\"
Indiana Punchline's reading is to strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the gossips balanced by traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read by keeping in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran proposed by Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these \"moderates\" who seriously fight the horrible lay Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics pushes the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to \"moderate\" who do not exist to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
\"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account\" Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
We need a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should it be?
Do you realize that neither the criminals, nor the victims, do you have any chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, my friend...
Wouldn't criminals be old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly about the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War 1 by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a pauté of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a mess!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
What clichés without argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a mother wearer.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilized hetero couples, too.
How about the kids!
What a shame it would be to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for the retirement of this woman (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary \"solution\" in the evolution of medicine known to our world.

The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the \"marketing\" of the body is limited.

There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
There is still a problem with the exploitation of the bodies.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampireized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought \"always the same story,\" but here is a very well-written and well-thought little article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Latest train for Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police series called Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative got up in anger and shouted: \"What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!'
The Palestinian representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
That it displeases the Israeli anti-Israeli is an obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translated: the global geopolitical relationship ...
And it has always been so since the policy is globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What power report did the creation of Israel allow?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it doesn't just revolve around Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are only pseudo-chomskystic billevedas written no others.
That's what proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter likes her well, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrified some: sometimes he speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting was completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic commitment to it is completely unnecessary, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) rule primarily in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich people, At no time does he say he simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not rule on our behalf: he insists that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, protests, petitions, little importance and try to influence politics from that.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being active politically in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are spins that will change their mind if they really risk losing the election), but it is annoying to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the time to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left on account.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting was completely distorted.
The needless to slip a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me very nervous because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment university students from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label \"Billevesées pseudo-chomskystes\".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even headburns added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This \"funda\" is particularly evident in my view that the intellectual debate has long since been held in the RDV of History where trade historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become depleted for the benefit of loan-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a culprit, an emissary goat.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these emissary goats that are the key to the voice of their thoughts.
I believe instead that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty party.
This is due to a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem from the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or/liberal slope (of the two terms the second mark a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of the least state / not the whole state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, said elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not a support by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old times, that of his god of then, Stalin, the small father of the peoples.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today even Pierre Manent would no longer like to attack Michel in this way...
Gauchet is deeply reflecting on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this horse orchestrated by hard left-wing humanities researchers who can't bear the fact that their mantras are being relieved, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these \"rebels\" which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other \"yellows\" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were friendly about me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so of the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-Whites.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter came out with a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and, above all, in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and through this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians are mainly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Iensiei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' views on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept bad memories of it, all people are brave and, in fact, those in London have been very kind is the only reason why I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are brave, how they remember who they were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would attack them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: pardon, but the judicial circles are frankly marked right.
When at the Judicial Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its impartiality can be done on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it requires that two obstacles be removed.
The observer's political vision as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law is then obliged to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of his non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Pretentation and non-knowledge is not objective analysis.
And if all of this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics which implicitly reveal that it leaves very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to record well the following in the third ratio.
The corruption person* from the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is given to the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area in question is that of the dispossession* of heirs committed to the process through scams* by successor gealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives EUR 150 million in bad years, while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the French notariat's quasi-judicial impunity*.
For the understanding of their mechanism, one party was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this relates to the statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogy and heirs who are reluctant to get away with it, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws in favour of heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics which ignores these kinds of rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Prices are likely to be totally prohibitive.
More equipment to uproot the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all the ground, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires jammed, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like Epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's crust on a dog.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the land, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a hangover for the longboard.
There are hills that would please them.
The prices really seem high, but really there are people who put this kind of price on a bike, so \"you see.\"
The entire tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available to them.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know to be needed.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'M TAKING THAT the \"long distance\" wheelchair doesn't get on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people who are under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation, as this blockade imposes a “collective sentence” on all civilians in Gaza.
- Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market - ...
Oh, that's not wood language, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The USA has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Do not forget that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built around the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, without profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night hit on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) differently.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
\"What does she put on rent?\"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb \"to let\" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right assurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to allow it to do business (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repelled, flown, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it it would always be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
all these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to put it?
No Marine The Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who are you defending here?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to fall open!
High finance, specula, plays with our businesses, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, with our health care structures, with our debts thus our institutions.
They are a threat in our everyday lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of any hyper-mega-obeses of the money.
Up to the contrary, FH said: \"My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.\"
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Minister of Economic Affairs a former Bank Rothschild, a history of better defending bankers' interests, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
There was no other competitor?
What do you call that? Go back to his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really \"refused\" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book \" Castles of Steel\" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was burning at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the following battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm and day-to-day sea.
Furthermore, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
\"There was some confusion among German ships as to the fate of the two scoured cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after they had ceased shooting, and a race-to-go began.
Leipzig saw something in the fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, meets the battle late and lives the Monmouth, bent and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing out his lights on the ship's flag, the proposal to leave was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22.15 a.m.
Concerned about reports of a British cook in the vicinity, he moved north.\"
So, if this is true, the Germans, in darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important scarf of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they became disillusioned to enjoy their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them injury and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised by the UMP to demand that it be included in the law that a definitively convicted elected party is therefore ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the left-wing elected on the right.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A INCRIPTION TO THE MUCH OF THE MAGISTER COUNCIL
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Held by politicians (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to amateurize those themselves who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to measure their sufficient.
I met them in the subway towards noon with their little signboards - from the basements for justice - they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing unions, or even far-right unions, designated as the target of the people on his side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the present time, the right-wing defrays the judicial news, it is simply that she has committed the facts that follow it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the object of his attention have not been treated with favor.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports trade unions with such commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
Now we wonder if the mission - some judges are not getting out more than instructing.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge him and to incarcrate the whole-one-chacun.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry weak of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many served as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directions fill the stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor to all these programs, has launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all did the Eurovision competition, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't participate in the contests.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to result in a career than the typical rock walk, even though in your dreams you think that all guitar tighters who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a poem primary school level will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even get an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied - distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us these distant peoples as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual bigotia, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations on a daily basis.
Unless you interpret unwisely in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our manner is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object to the religious sphere.
Article very interesting whatever it is.
It's the ephemeral deco to move the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustration figures in the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretation of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the ears of interpretations not of the scientific whole that lead to the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of the disciplines make us laugh a little bit?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very ancient and the archaeologists relied on their \"instinct\" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays there are so many technical and scientific means that the interpretation of searches is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf his book \"The shamans of Prehistory\", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published at the La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this very instructive article
Hetero men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in it.
So it's over with us?
I really don't understand why can't we continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the sink?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy on it on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect you to have that kind of comment on your part.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, I can suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
I can suggest that we all search for a newspaper that pays real journalists, courageous, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and perils.
It's more than just making you laugh with those puerile ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on then.
If these \"puerile ass jokes\" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video amateur of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. tank) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (tele-right, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well seen, I also share that view.
But there's also that if the very British FOM gets the SC in, it's going to allow Nico Rosberg to have the chance to have a chance to beat the English that was then leading...
You're missing out on this blog, dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to dig up all your c******ries.
No, it's just not.
There have been a lot of conspiracys in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of a pilot's chance of victory to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out the safety because it's the AIF.
Size shade.
In the light of amateur images, the absence of image allows the AIF to avoid the awkward questions of the type: How do the Commissioner act a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners clearly sees a green flag acting, it means that the race can resume normally and that we are more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark mistaking of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag rests.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as appropriate, it may be 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells from the pub.
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's \"patriotic\" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making a buzz with information that we don't really need to worry about is just to keep on scaring people so they can continue to control them.
\"When the tabloids touch about Ebola, we all catch fear\" It should be \"derailing\", not \"stolen.\"
Given the medical reference, \"tosser\" is much better said in this context than \"derailing\".
I wonder if all people who argue that Ebola could become airborne realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too honored.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It makes me sad that the media is talking about most things with that optimism around.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without going to hysteria) so that the government can get us out when it needs it.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have a Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
More at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of passing through it for years.....
Perfectly unnecessary testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: they are taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Do you put at the same level of fantasist theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
\"Resilience\" is the word \"grandmother-adulted\" by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrunik hit us with \"resilience\".
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrunik, I hope that he has broken a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to reveal the Sentinels of the air...
So why?
It was a great series, and it seems to me that those who bring it up are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pipi-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and that the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (though I'm an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to redeploy the old.
The series almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at those schedules.
And besides, the episode of a half-hour is now at 5:30 p.m., Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a \"despite\" 60-year-old man, but I don't look at this show every day!
There is no \"Mount of the temple\" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the Splanades for decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Could it be Argentine?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the plain of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or owner of the Rocker, is rocking in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac there.
As soon as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naphtali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also good to show how far Jerusalem's annexation is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: \"God be praised.\"
To boast us tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïves to half-witted, elongated on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a beautiful work of propaganda!
It is unfortunate that Reuters' photographer did not take the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Mount of the Temple and prefer to visit the Jewish faithful in contrabass, praying to the Wall of Cries.
@Mat, If this picture bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that she must condemn.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is to revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone wild, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they were lucky enough to have a job and that they could not afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave ever greater pay to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers will really speak of one voice.
Instead of laughing and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being treated with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TPCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That seems incredible, but that's exactly what the mechanism for dispute settlement between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated on your back.
Didn't Churchill say \"blood, sweat and tears\"?
This is what makes excellent returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automobile market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself the safe of France's eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the country's decline, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I still don't know what
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm sorry.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the category interests, there is already enough of the protected professions with trade unions, which has created an equal break with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk from an employee.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right of strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not, it's a disaster.
And with the carts that prepare, the government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille was referring to the military and other civil servants, since this is the topic commented here...
Let us delete, through its delegates, in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He will become: -8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management -
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of computer power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled \"The Great British Bake Off Review\". ????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (what a trumpeter: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done \"bum, here's my fucking cake now graze it and bow down to your master\"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were held apart.
And there is also this idea of \"playing security, there is always next week\" that disappears the last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm gonna take this.
I am grateful to those who do and thus offer us a great entertainment and motivates us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually set days to do so, and they had to shine one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to separate, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was a little dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill didn't want, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several of the challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time given.
There's also cancer that looks, with solar blows.
We're all successful at the moment.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mostly blocked by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to \"hunt\" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and \"cancers\".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man they have the interest to allow us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and lets the UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to view your interlocutor as a remained when you post a comment?
Especially for minor accuracy that was misunderstood in the commentary, which he himself intended to demonstrate pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanoma habit, UVs only make it easier to develop.
They don't try it.
For proof: not all bronzed people necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a whistle tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for anyone.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And more importantly, can we move it to the mixer?
Or move it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient strength is applied there and the strength of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is intended.
I think that the army would need something more resistant and that is why it has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as first-line communication equipment.
But for others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied there.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it folded already?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone was removed from the main production chain and you can barely see how it might be back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS was not installed correctly and is thus stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that the industrialists produce in » industrials' We put in super u top but all the little trade and all the little trade are concerned How to boost good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in French)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his or her priorities where he or she understands them.
For my part, food is one.
Come on out of the blue, I'll kiss you.
It is called fools, or rather fools, of people who see the world through an ideological \"software\" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason degrouping.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tarterie, joining in this the left caviar, which they are sometimes born, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holiday in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartery also do not be surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and thorough theory as well as for all the related details (aircraft, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not that complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in eco-friendly things all the time.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecosystems because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
She's so wrong that she's vaguely like a female nudge.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic abilities.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin is not able to draw
That's not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing, it's much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for only this, a camera will do the job.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to do with savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service....
(Honesty forces France to reduce its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more dramatically, to begin with Britain.)
It's only half-enhanced...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A single approach, when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised Sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
That all those who have sewn little or enough the military thing dare come to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no wasted money in this perimeter and this without bursting to laugh...
Applying the same potion to the whole public service and public finances will do a little better.
And for Josi: really cheery: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can be a little busy!
Well, the savings that everyone agrees to say they have to be done about, it must be seen somewhere, doesn't it?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it comes to their home, the poor darlings.
It would be wrong to do so, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because in this case it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at each job closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't appreciate the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most horrifying thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's the depression of getting her Facebook thread down and seeing that 80% of her friends started their status with the phrase \"This embarrassing moment.\"
I think they're going to make a movie.
He will probably rely on hilarious scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex on the bus going to work and realizes only where his skirt came back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, I believe the author takes the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his coming back on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
You don't have a computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just really shown that he's all at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I think I'm in the opposite direction!
It is absolutely necessary for me to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible glitter and insurpassable genius that makes Mr. Brooker's keyboard look like a divine glory.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments in democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associations.
Until the new order we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, as citizens, to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner that they have planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown ....
Translate : Winds and solar farms are the Rond points of tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the network is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, drastically reduces our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not interested in anything.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by wind or PV renewable is already more GHG on the other steps and above all gas, or worse of coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replaceing nuclear with wind or PV renewables would be against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 more I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove otherwise than I said.
As for what I didn't say it is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact nothing you didn't answer what I said and how all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do it.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a cost-effective and ineffective way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the vapour of greenhouse gases of less effect than the Co2 it is really recall the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a \"gender of South Asia\"...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments don't want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had named India a giant in South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, Kolkata Athletic is set to 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how can we ever compete with our \"screaming neighbours\"...
The low cost launch race is paid cash.
Too bad for such a nice project.
For the incident, the possible design defect manifests only with a helium too cold.
So maybe we're not in a lack of design, but implementation...
in contrast to arianspace which is a private society, it seems well that sosouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may pay satellites in frigates who know.
This is all the more annoying that many media are holding back the only titles of articles - and many readers hold only those titles.
In total it creates a mistaken impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project while it is only a launch problem.
