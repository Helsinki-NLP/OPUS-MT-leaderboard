Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American President of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, the medal and the cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet his sumum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the Committee's very presence.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at present.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to highlight.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kroners (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not a price for himself, but for all who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an invitation to act for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice's police charged the president of the association Société des Protecteurs de la nature de Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction work procedures and asked for money from investors for their personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for Litoměřice police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and risks up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting strips are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on tri-strike strips at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you can find the appropriate buckets.
I don't mean we wouldn't choose all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that our city's municipal councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone of the waste sorting not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which primarily requires time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like me, but I don't think that's so much.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city, it's not a deadlock either.
So to end up, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
Out of laziness.
It makes them a trap to get to the stripes.
I'm not surprised if they do.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any colored bins on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and so-called estheticism do not take too much interest in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city a first-time hockey league place that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying some extra buckets and offering the choice of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after I had dragged a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the region of South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget has removed retired silversmiths and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the debt of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government making loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. \"This is just putting the problems back on later, mining the ground,\" Janota said.
It must be known that the interest to be paid on the money borrowed is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to put money.
If it does not lower social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all who are now on the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will not lack 163 billion in the cash registers, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will increase more and more rapidly and with her, interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to repair it, and it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the constructions of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly previously decided and initiated sections which cannot change projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major jobs, and the removal of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very well - it will be able in the dividends of the ČEZ (Electric Energy Supplier and Distributor), which the State has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to complete the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this suggestion increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at worst, on the government budget reserve.
It also lacks a hundred million in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which must allow for an online monitoring of each administration's expenditure.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance found no money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans will consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American society VMware, which primarily deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alter between them, you can differentiate them into personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware society in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
He will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not about fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is growing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
The shortage of snow in mountains worries hoteliers
Desert runways pose no problem only to climbers.
Lack of snow deters people from booking their skiing in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to denigrate free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users run the offers, ask for the prices, but do not dare to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas, - said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams at Špindler v Mlýn, you'd better not hesitate to book.
If savings are given priority and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hoteliers are only offering one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try another time to put them in, but they're going to give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease, - estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours Tourist Agency of Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is of the utmost interest to us for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheap last-minute Christmas stays, - said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete, - thinks Schiefert.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Horizon Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year's Day and Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of Janvier des Polonais and Février is also sold, - inform Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at 90 percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of the occupation at present.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again, certainly indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hoteliers should not, however, hope for more snow.
Thursday will make it cooler and if there are precipitations, they should be annoying in the mountains.
But then, time should be warmed up, inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeatation is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the tireless effort with which Barack Obama, President of the Wise Reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine so intensely awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression - as in Iraq - he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: -A new road forward -
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumed Iraq as \"irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences\"
The following months have shown, however, that Bush's strategy, which emanated from campaign commanders' recommendations, was the only possible and likely to be successful at such a point that today's newspapers do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, he said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be repeated
It was again the campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticences of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but without a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it was originally 10,000.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy appears to be his intention to remove the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this entire process within three years. All Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half-increase will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no person can be counted and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership on a day-to-day basis according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only from powder to the eye behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a \"ready-to-act state\" which is the basic purpose of the operation does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes him perplexed by his volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the turmoil of the war for their \"soon return to the house\" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect abstention of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is geared to the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem by resorting to military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only Rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time left for him to sit on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 principal leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resale before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus in the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performances at Wall Street.
I assume Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to be taken, said former investment bank Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after having set aside almost $17 billion for awards over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premium will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to allocate a single tax of fifty percent to bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in the technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the Romanian German writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The price of chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the pecuniary award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish krones in each category. (approximately €1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The highly anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been given this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since he was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a two-war country - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He added that in some situations war is essential for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will dedicate his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the coming year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position at the office will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
It was the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, who briefed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to the signature of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government rejected the proposals by the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement that called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Government of Fischer and that it is due to charge it the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not require it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the \"serious problem\" of irresponsible deficiency of public finances.
There is now, according to him, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a broader political party consensus, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is exhausting and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as \"drastic verdicts\"
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is exhausting and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday already, the ČSSD has described the ratification of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invancu film will expose much about the country, its battles and its victories to the world.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded to the Oscars, embodies Nelson Mandela's life film, tirelessly fighting the apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a nineteen-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, \"If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor aged seventy-year-old who has been rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama, located in the middle of the box, has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery himself becoming a slave, a fictitious U.S. president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never one of the living and important ones for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is an invasive Latin word and is the title of an English author's poem William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela, newly elected, knows that his country remains and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people with sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the world's Outiders.
The South African team will make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to get Mandela's story on big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be in a retreat before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shook your hand, I recovered your energy, it transmitted itself, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the cover of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation in these words: \"It's a very good story, a very well made film\"
In the evaluation of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
We were able to observe a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the \"Bulava\"-type missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of \"Bulava\" as \"missile that does not fly\"
A missile that doesn't fly but that shines
This 13th trial was conducted at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the device again.
It was obviously the third floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, \"Bulava\" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and immersed vessel
This is why the mysterious above-Norway light caused by an unidentified flying object is likely to have been by a \"Bulava\" defective.
As a matter of fact, the Norwegians did not doubt a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely about failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage only affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the trial launches went unaccrued, the Ministry of Defence's management considered that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore employs the generals of optimism and they always claim that one day \"Bulava\" will fly smoothly and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear cores of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the Moscow CSKA at 51 years of age
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former World Champion, Stanley Cup Olympic champion and holder will lend hand-in-hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entrance to Petrograd during the Friday match.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is now the President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says the Sergey Nyemtchinov club coach, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified if the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of Fetissov, Kassatonov, Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he has twice caught gold at the Olympic Games, seven world champions, he has triumphed to Canada Cup as well as to the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Nošovice Hyundai plant agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
Petr Vaněk's spokesman for Hyundai confirmed this.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech kroner bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
He will also be assigned a posterior for the day worked on November 28th.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivated its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays to the end of the year Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hotest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car workers were forced to work almost every day two overtime in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the strike status after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car plant and the unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested the bad conditions of pay and so-called gossip.
The management argued with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
On Monday's strike announcement, the unions also asked that employees who had ceased production should not be subject to any penalty.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a pay of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for them.
Nošovice Hyundai's car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV-endurant viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the organism.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
In some cases, the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as with some already available drugs is the case.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of the sick can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
Their consumption, however, results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect anymore.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to confront the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a combination of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new, improved substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple-walled cages are formed by the atoms of bore, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If the HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining to the researchers in a press release published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV-protein substances has been tested in test cases as well as in its resistant variants obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarbons is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to look further at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Łezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispusted around the budget. The ODS takes on Fisher, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek described the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the ODS' statement as a drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
The spokesman for the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party were obviously no longer functioning.
According to Nečas, the Head of Government should decide whether to support the House of Deputies on the minority concerned with the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments of up to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's claim to the proposals of social democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish as what an amended budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and inoperability
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave her office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his move to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in his office.
His disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to combat the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
This is the matter of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did not do anything harmful, said Topolánek in a text communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments claimed TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a struggle against the amount of the public finances deficit, it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the Chamber.
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS made a follow-up to the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not little children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered any reproach from the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the Chamber and a destruction of all that was positive, it was done in person in Topolánek.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
Czech Railways will remove or limit some less-charged express or regional trains from 13 December and will, on the contrary, strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall to the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedules compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the people of the Ostrava region who will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendulum copper.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the region of Hradec Kralové of eight percent overall, on the other hand Prague and its environs can be welcomed by an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will start at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to resolve visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to a price increase of the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will affect only one-day tickets ČD Net and internet tickets at reduced eLiška prices.
For travellers with no reduction card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while it was valid between cities from one region to another and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today took 75 people to the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but spoke of the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields in a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement to release the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the ravistors as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential lineage of the Ampatuans.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
They, however, renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the world-famous apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full readiness for the cutting of the world of football, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles in which Hollywood stars are “pâvant”.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film in his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I was well prepared.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela to be able - as has been said - to recover from his energy, he indicated at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual has added.
Bringing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of British writer John Carlin's novel was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term of office to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population and also Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the world cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
In order to be shown on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in uniting people back into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only - black - of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptical, as they have recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire swallowed a transformer of the Čeps company from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for the firefighters of Ustí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguish the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandatova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandadatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a nine.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps did not know anything of the same and that such incidents are isolated.
Electric power supplies were not interrupted, says ČEZ spokesperson for the Northern Bohemian Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, home, administration and industry operation was not influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines tracks of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, will today file a complaint for defamation against three Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute by Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked and claimed that the ends have been done, while only an offer has been made for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the Czech Railway prices that were signed last week.
So there's only one left to defend us.
In exchange for the slanders on Student Agency, Jančura said at Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint is a follow-up to his media show, which serves him as a free commercial for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and lying arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in advertising that will mention the unfavorable actions of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after New Year.
He stated that the campaign will focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to the threat of a Member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I do not know who this is, but I will not say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Votes already rise, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations should be paid on their own.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for one dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
The experts believe that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that non-vaccinated children would require.
To date, the State spent approximately 500,000 kroner per year on all vaccination of children.
Refunded vaccination was introduced with the Janota package -
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible requirement for vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that we must now follow, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumoccal vaccination process.
We do not consider it at all for the time being, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Pediatric Society, recognizes that voluntary vaccination is based on its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered - in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination - says Cabrnochová, however.
The specialists predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also breaks down because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to the concerns of practical pediatricians, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the State.
Some Members feared, however, that this would enable insurance to -deduce health insurance -
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurances to repay them.
According to estimates, paediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines individually, which is an important sum.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a \"Museum Flight\"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the museum's entrance into the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the press agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, the said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claims to have been authorized by his father to enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility - the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied such authorization, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in taxes and reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticisms of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling - a lack of opportunity to show that it was serious about the decrease in the deficit by reporting its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the lightnings by attacking the low wages and the average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession they were not responsible for and warned that \"problems\" were announced.
The decrease in social insurance - which will make it possible to obtain approximately GBP 3 billion a year - has angered the world of companies, as he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Assurance will still increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% banker bonus tax
The increase in corporation profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increased pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per year will earn 110 GBP more.
The Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was - difficult decisions - but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the first 5% of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in taxes and stressed that a decrease in expenditures was a \"water drop in the ocean\" in relation to what was needed.
\"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years,\" he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would start again at the end of the year.
However, the Labour forecast for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be met - was questioned after the Chancellor was forced to review his first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
\"Missed opportunity\"
The Conservatives who will launch a new campaign of advertising on Thursday warning against the Labour debt crisis stated that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers were unable to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, eluting - cynically - difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
\"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do,\" said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Phantom Cabinet Treasury. \"They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it.\"
- Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner -
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the next reductions, contrary to the Tory proposals that would result in a faster and more significant decrease in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's expenditures and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were \"built on the wind\"
Nick Robinson, Political Editor of the BBC, stated that the calendar of advertisements - such as increased inflation for certain disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of accusations of propaganda, being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
‘Low budget —
Although the Ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that the restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
\"The pain is in fact only postponed,\" said his Director, Robert Chote.
\"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner,\" added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
‘This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of this.’
The FBI is investigating the U.S. arrests in Pakistan.
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the American embassy in Pakistan at the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these individuals.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained, said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, a spokesman for the FBI, claimed that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
\"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really the students who have been missing,\" she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington said that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of them.
She said that the house was already guarded by the local police and that no charges had yet been made against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the news agency Reuters, but stated that the United States needed to work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students had been taken away from home by their families, in North Virginia, late November.
Amnesty condemns the Iranian abuse
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as low as ever, according to the Amnesty International association's report.
the report presents \"repetitions of violations\" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections of June.
One man quoted in the report said that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
\"Fashion confessions\"
Amnesty International related the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook's networks - and protested against the results of the election.
\"They have often hit my face - it has been cited.
\"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me\"
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the election-losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorder and government response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small trenple preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city sparkling upside down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents - he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night, the snow will be abandoned to the fountain.
They and us, too.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, \"Why the French don't like scarf\" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what M. Bozen calls \"Muslim Spaces\" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are the practical problems, he said, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The conservators do not believe in the idea of French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which is now a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite, so virulent of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims were not spoiled, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a \"closeness of key values\"
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say \"yes, but not yet\"
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In \"On a thin layer of ice\" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowledge of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were doing their proof by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspiring to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface required for a free adult. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often refers to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Motoski Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most north waters of these two nations of the hunt that the ice will remain for the longest time.
In his new book, \"After the ice\" Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphericists nor the oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not wrong to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneer trips to Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information on the source of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the changes of relief under it.
Satellite surveillance and the probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by tough men, campaigning in the cold.
Mr. Anderson is contemplating the extraordinary and minute world of the Arctic ice tributary system, made up of hot water nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
\"In a few months, maybe it will be our turn\"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson took a seven-hour bus trip to drop a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on Veterans' graves in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of flight 93 from United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation Foundation gave more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
70-year-old Charleen Hunt from Westminster said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitoufled in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers have declared.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held by hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closer to now, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the present wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some were reading aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, sunk in the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to pick herself up on the grave of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
\"Longtime after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him.\"
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, affirmed the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being \"dangerous\"
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, risk arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sanchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the authorizations have always been denied.
Perhaps the detention of an American national will increase the tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a \"soft\" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, so that the United States can make it that way.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a grievor is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often need to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba, called \"New Castro, even Cuba,\" referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader in replacing Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, when both countries start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying that they hoped that this case would enable an important network of terrorist recruiters to be dismantled to search for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the Forbidden Mountains of the Northeast to become a haven of terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition that they kept the anonymous due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of those in whom they give their confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of bartenders, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove themselves spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay increased attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are calling for an action for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked the streets here, on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when few things have happened during discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B - and one in Spanish, saying - the Earth says it has enough -
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the crushing problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already taking place.
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to pass the word and call on leaders from all over the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep anonymous because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing have lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by - some big explosions -
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that protesters have not been able to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked whether he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: \"In fact, it is something I did not know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring - The event being important, I cannot hear what it is going on outside -
He observed that walking might appear to be harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others -
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematical results brought good news to Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District remains still far behind the head institutions, the report shows that Grades 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) show the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average performance of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) to WashingtonD.C. has increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their Afro-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap has in fact increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white results were not included in the test results as the sample was not important enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of the group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not leap for joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (parliad Democrat), Member of the D.C. Council, whose daughter is in Grade 4, in Eaton Elementary ( elementary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (schools).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary-class pupils and the beginning of college who have not integrated the foundations of reading earlier in their school course and who are sufficiently late compared to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, such as they were put in place in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we must continue to work to offer better interventions to these students below the level of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studied the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in Washington.
Thus, this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Newark School Superintendent, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considers to be a \"point of departure\" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and blinks a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where the tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when she was told the low ratio of law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely posed for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left the high school where they have become parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a second-generation Hispanic, five-year-old high school -- a remarkable success, considering that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico and Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country's labour force.
Researchers who study the beatings claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and a need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must think of providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared to you), it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when low-income family students are in middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Government of Iraq has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and Europe's oil companies are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by dozens of years of war and sanctions.
American companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields that were auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put an auction was lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies open their doors, Ruba Husari, the editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an Internet information site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, supported by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, stopped U.S. oil companies from entering Iraq with more force, which had the world's third largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained strong ties with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and provided their technical advice, left their hands empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more committed to contracts than other companies and has gone with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions made offers that were then compared to the barile rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaida organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the al-Qaida operations organizers this week, declared Friday from the U.S. counter-sponsibility authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and the Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civil secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local activists rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally cracked bodies”
While it was entirely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, the two United States anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of Al-Qaida's military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, stated one of the authorities who wished to keep anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second US representative said that Somali had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had a very good relationship with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the U.S. general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jallov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impotently killing suspected informants, the site states.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he was going to resign from his position in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of widespread allegations of corruption during the United Nations-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure occurred while the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and which would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month void between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a Italo-Switzerland citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of encouraging President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- had been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to international election observation --
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he is assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the United Nations hampered his ability to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the great world powers were soon going to impose \"significant additional sanctions\" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwive of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the eventuality of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that a \"set of motivations and punishments\" could be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less secure with nuclear weapons, because their people would suffer greatly from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face \"probable\" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme fully into conformity with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agree to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of developing confidence on both sides and of saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has been moving away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's raid on some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of major additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called \"greater sanctions\"
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called \"unfounded allegations\" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution -
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before taking the plane for the rich Kurdistan oil region to meet with the Troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US troop-reduction plans, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the suspended withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: \"We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.\"
We will not abandon you -
In ageing China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up with posters of propaganda telling them, \"The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children,\" and \"An extra baby, it's an additional grave.\"
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, radically changed their direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left, Wang said, age 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the single child in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and cakes, nicknamed the \"small emperors\" a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and older will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in coastal rich cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future -
Shanghai is about to become - as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, she said.
A Progressive Mitigation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is to date, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women were already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The government of the city has dispatched family planners and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and slip prospectors under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of the family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town in the suburb of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in demands for couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, always receives only four to five applications per month.
The leaders of Shanghai, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want to have more children.
They want to pour their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly view the single child's policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one child because she was one of them. \"We were the family's center and we used to have everyone take care of us.\"
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we don't really want to take care of others -
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it's the most severe.
For couples working at two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it must be selfish yet succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up seeing their parents fighting in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- -You need to change your apartment - -- and planning -- -When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write your CV to get a place in the best motherhood -
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- returned under the lights of the Friday ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the cargo, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special United Nations working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming, in the course and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gave the process great flexibility, said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who prepared six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary of the United Nations on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as - the full picture -
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal changes occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiating, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder towards China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, said Stern, which also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented one hour after China's foreign vice minister, He Yafei stated that the U.S. chief negotiator, was in \"good sense\" or was \"extremely irresponsible\" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not support China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, which is also a climate advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that negotiations would lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island states has, in part, put political pressure on the complete political process, because they are now unified and demand that emerging economies such as China and India act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they needed to resolve most of the problems in the process before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, came down from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend meetings in-houses and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congrès every day -- guitar activists present night shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- are a real challenge.
Intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We go into the grand court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the World Conservation International Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle blow will penetrate the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburb train will reach 225 km/h, while it will drive from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburb train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing suburb cities, the length of business travel will be much less and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of environmental hazards are likely to slow down the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new London to the West Midlands line will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a higher-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennines toManchester and Scotland and another going north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
\"It seems that this will be the best performance option,\" said a rail professional.
When it is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK's fastest network in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow 400m long trains that can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on the rails in northern Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transfer from planes to trains, constituting a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers refund the loan of 75,000 GBP for the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were \"maintained\" increased his loan of 75,000 GBP to build an extension in oak at his second house, in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out control of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan stated that the complaints could not be - clearer or simpler -
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a \"veranda for pleasure\"
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons regarding his prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee has dismissed him last month from any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of 271,406 GBP of his property from London to the house of his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan called for approximately 1,400 GBP per month of interest to borrow until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of 75,000 GBP.
The RBS standard interest rate changed from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The last publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for 1,250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Chief of the Phantom Office in September, after a cover journalist filmed him, saying that members of the parliament were to survive - on budget - after the scandal of expenses.
\"In fact, it is now national, you must live - on budget - and you are treated as - of the m...e\"
He said: \"I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't do it --
The member of the parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil merchant, began to have to explain his expenses in May after it appeared that he had asked thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of fees that this - could be considered excessive -
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: \"It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg\"
He added: “There is no problem with any problem of misappropriation or development or use of rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be cleaner or simpler -
Trust me, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar.
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, a calendar of interactive Advent.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every day in December, using Christmas songs as theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel chosen to date include \"I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas\" for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: \"We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
“As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality.
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have shown Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have carried out several hundred interrogations.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, 100 thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is responsible for reaching an agreement by Friday that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has helped make the political price a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke windows and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-twisted police officers intervened without any care.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violent groups, which had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were called - without distinction - stressing that about a hundred of them - were always held in the street on Saturday evening - monetized and maintained in a sitting position despite the extreme cold -
Parliament's party, the court, rather good child, took the lead at the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without trying to penetrate it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters had come in as well as in the wake of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue waterproof sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen in the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form blue marades for \"justice for climate\"
Today, we went down to the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that sit in Africa, streams where we can walk like we never did before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to - link climate justice and social justice -: -today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world -
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, marched in red, with bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network -350 - gathered a few hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a \"farce\"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a \"farce\"
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first poll after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17H00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the officials of the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in law, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the conduct of the poll.
These elections are a hoax.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, \"regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,\" said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which resulted in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination lies at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located somewhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who come to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For his part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have walked the world Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living, have called for nearly 700 people on the margins of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament's party, the general court, a good child, has taken the lead in the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without trying to penetrate it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of several hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti- riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without household, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violent groups, which had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavé and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have at the eye the extremist groups, had warned the police spokesperson, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in the car and are in the hands of the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue waterproof sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen in the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form blue marades for \"justice for climate\"

French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen to “climate justice and social justice”: “today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world”
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, demonstrated, dressed in red and boasting bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network -350 - gathered a few hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The history of geo is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published on the Sunday JDD that history and geography were \"enforced\" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education as a scientific terminal.
Since then, the first students will have all four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, \"we have to get out of hypocrisy\" because, according to him, \"the S-wire is no longer a scientific thread\" but, in large, it focuses on the best students.
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-filières of the S, he goes on to point out again: -I have not heard many historians and intellectuals tell of the absence of terminal geography history in the technological lycées -
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in L'Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the government's plan to remove the compulsory teaching of the history-geography in terminale S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some elected from right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that he was \"no question\" to delete the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will cover their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their teaching ability, explained the minister.
In addition, they will follow the courses in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you are already getting more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, he has continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education.
It also reaffirms the project to remove the school card - by 2012 -
A Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince them about the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the conferences - Ernest - a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, every fifteen minutes, filmed and opened to the public, found a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them a desire to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannzo conference, one of the organizers of this day who drew his name from the one given by the students to the fishes of the school basin.
Twenty speakers are selected from the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes - said to AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke out of note, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will retain that the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific issue.
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day “Ernest” is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Deferrals of payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called on Friday to \"general capitalization\" to require the payment by the end-of-year parties of the premiums and overtime which the payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd Syndicate of Supervisors) has asked staff who will not be in service to show up on Tuesday morning in front of prisons and to \"block them\" to - report the theft of their dues -
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization - judge - shameful and unacceptable - the non-payment in December of the additional hours, night prizes, Sundays and holidays - worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the federal autonomous prison union (Ufap/Unsa), - calling for general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger -
The Corrections Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the reliquats will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the prison management to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation arose from a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur in the future, adds Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for management staff with famous job and objective premiums, has deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom - budgetary constraints have a good back-up -
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was indignified, announcing its decision to boycott until further order - all meetings and convocations -
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regulated in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take on staff denarii, says Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad lotties than others.
But in any case the account is not there, found Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer “best things” than the ones he receives
The American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, entrusted to the \"paper\" of the small Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: -I give things more tasty than those I receive -
As part of a special show to be broadcast Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the late-year holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, so said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog would have - of course - a gift, according to excerpts from the show released in advance.
And Michelle Obama was wrong about her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: \"Not really, I offered you nice gifts last year - she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to grant it before he replied with humor by showing the finger the pearl necklace of the First Lady: \"Who offered you this?\"
During this one-hour show, at the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was an ardent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his father Kenyan had rarely seen offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father here to see us for Christmas and when he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It's only much later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined all the furniture against the wall, rather than fix them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to - injuries - important after an operation in France, but the situation is - under control - according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found that the injuries resulting from the operation of the hernia discae suffered in Paris on 26 November, indicated to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had needed a restorative operation.
However, the singer's press service sought to ensure that the situation was - under control - while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid \"pains and complications\"
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he or she has opened an eye, add RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that, according to some sources, no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the International Parc Monceau Clinic for this hernia dial.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through \"a bad pass\" but he assured himself not to be \"no worries\" for the rocker, who is \"a fighter\"
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a mess because I had 12 hours of aircraft after such an operation, it wasn't fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, claiming that Johnny Hallyday - acted satisfactorily on antibiotics - and that the infection was - said -
Mr. Camus had also said that he had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the surprise general, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been performed with a small colon cancer, followed by a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as expected his long \"Tour 66\" presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 Mondials in the Great Basin, started an international title on Thursday on a distance that it especially loves, the 50 m swims free, at the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records of the world beat while waiting for a deferment.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other by Russia on relays 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which stood on the record of the world of 50 m free, of which he owns the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two reindeer distances of swimming, the free 50 m, is the 28-year-old French who settled in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve German Paul Biedermann, the world's double champion in great bass this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he had on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but imposed himself nevertheless signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danois Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up on this race.
I knew I couldn't hit a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday $1.5 million, well above his estimate, announced the Sotheby's art merchant.
This panel was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars before two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ.
The marble - representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world - had explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the Roman and Egyptian antique art auctions at Sotheby's.
He was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still under way, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have most so far purchased, a spokesperson from Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told the AFP.
The discovery of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian special hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Marechal Pétain.
There was a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an \"Emile Zola succession\" - opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of \"Thérèse Raquin - and the fresco of \"Rougon-Macquart -
Attempted abortion from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the late President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been denied an exception by the putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arrived on Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane departed to its original place, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to \"decommission\" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a non-conduct.
But the late president refused, because he wished to go to Mexico as head of state in charge of the guest.
The putschist government - has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign - said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday on the Globo radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few chords the fallen president, refugee to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted an application for a non-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it contains no asylum application, the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday on Honduran radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be done as President of the Honduran people, he had emphasized.
The departure rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the late president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of \"high treason\" whose prosecution of justice, according to the putschist government.
President putschist Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial poll recognized by the United States but challenged by countries in Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street mounts, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68,78 points to 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was allocated 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different economics, according to Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, it has tempered, considering that the market focused on -the glass half full -
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, which show that business improves in the fourth quarter of the year.
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the opposite of an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new registrations of unemployment in the United States have increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 requests.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen to the lowest in the last year, said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury bond to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the bond to 30 years at 4.492% on 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power Supporters Consecrate the White Lady · Global Voices
A few hundred Cuban supporters of power had married political detainees gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 white women, married or close to political prisoners, were taken to the streets by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the center of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, found a journalist of the AFP.
At the bottom of the Yankees!, \"mercenaires,\" \"the street belongs to the revolutionaries, \"Live Fidel and Raul\" were chanting, the punch lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came - to ensure their protection -
The day before, a similar demonstration took place against the \"La Havana Lady in White\" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana area of the Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to show up on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were, they, called by civilian police, found a journalist of the AFP.
The police have forced the dissidents who have been captured by government supporters in civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
Dissident interrogations under similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the \"Women in White\" had organized an unauthorized march to \"request the release of all political prisoners\" in the number of 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under locks.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as \"mercearies\" or \"agents\" at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of pro-government activists on Thursday against “contro-revolutionaries”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced kills an octogener at the knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed force of two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 boulevard Jean-Jaures, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Gravely wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union leader Alliance, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or before this same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about 30 years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The other wounded days are in danger, vital organs being apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and would have been hospitalized (in a state of shock) according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently at random: one thirty-one quadrogen, the latter severely.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore cross behind his back, explained on site a union leader Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, have tried to control the forced labour, according to evidence collected by the AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, told Alberto, server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, of whom they were responsible, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured at punching, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Passers have come to tell me that there was someone injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a security position, and I saw a very important plague in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about thirty years was injured at knife blows.
They are personnel of the national police who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office has seized the investigation of the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forced worker was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was, in a state of overexcitation, as - all the forced of this species whose forces are excavated under the effect of the action -
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer called for a new Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a dying case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the director of the \"Pianist\" lawyer, denounced in 1977 three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California for serious procedural errors.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, \"made it cold in the back\"
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious misconduct.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary \"Roman Polanski: wonted and desired\" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), of the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr Wells had finally declared at the end of September to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argumenter already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for \"unlawful sexual relations\" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski - must be there to attend the hearing -
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker asks for a favor at the court, while disregarding her authority.
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed - that there were other alternatives to the flight -
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: “Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, slowed down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar increase: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq has abandoned 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery, summarized the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of financier and much more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence was significantly adjusted in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a further increase in the dollar, at the top of two months ahead of the euro, which pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation, said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury bond to 10 years has increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the return on the bond to 30 years at 4.497% on 4,492% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month of periple throughout South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Monde are ready to cross the last line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the world's most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to return my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, stresses Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery - of landscapes to cut the breath in that country -
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of which became Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world but it is not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will point this 59th edition.
The candidates will dance in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
The candidates had as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their fondest memory will probably remain the shooting in Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 World Cup of Football, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been associating with people I never thought I could approach.
I will no doubt return for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news - are very positive - according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday’s news - are very positive - assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father’s bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, told the press David Hallyday at his release from the plane that drove him from Paris shortly after 13H00 locals (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia dial on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a comfort reason, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment, said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia discale on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated, to attend a school performance, she noticed a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salperière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles to the singer on Monday.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were out of town, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was \"part too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon\"
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it amazed me, since I had two hernias discals myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently \"part without drain, without anything - after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had performed actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to dissolve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in medical records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the order of the Doctors, accused him of being an unscrupulous man, who has continued to \"regularly\" before the Council of the Order, and who is far from recommendable.
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was \"perfectly well conducted\" and that the post-operative examinations were \"normal\"
The operation was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain - he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since that summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum of the New Centre to no longer use its logo
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by OPA of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, to no longer use it on any basis, subject to prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, deeming that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this Saturday strategy before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of the former MP Hervé de Charette who claimed UDF ownership for being the first to deposit it in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, UDF's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to let themselves be deposed, came out of his silence to set up a place of residence for the minister and the deputy, summing them to no longer use the stamp and to pass them the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecutions.
In recent days, you have multiplied your statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to +reprint+ the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it right to follow on your militant material and on the watch page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today+, also notice the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this sign, explains UDF's office, which maintains the NC to immediately remove the name of the UDF from any support and (its) website -
He also asks Hervé de Charette - to transmit the ownership of (la) mark to his legitimate entitled -
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF adherents, warn signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF - a full political movement since 1978 - and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had - made the choice - to leave in 2007 - to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP -
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) logo.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend the material and moral interests of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, when he filed the mark, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
It is a scandalous and fraudulent advantage of the absence of the UDF acronym to do so on its own.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the NC strategy: \"It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled\"
Liliane Bettencourt Case : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of octogenarian weakness to strip her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and 375,000 euros fines.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to report before 10 March 2010 saying, inter alia, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been able to be in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, and he told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, at the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
It is an excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting herself against François-Marie Bannier, photographer and artist, who is accused of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers as a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas have sometimes turned to the great family disbandment Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters from her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 mail, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: \"you can explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her wedding.
For her part, Nanterre's prosecutor once again felt that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a court judge had denied the last few days the right to his application for judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt - has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place - said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would take action once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Mangerial revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies for consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a question of having employees adhere to \"values - determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers the products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the markets to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the preference factors of the customers comes back regularly!
Employee demobilization can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI “requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision”; it requires employees to make a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are totally at odds with.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to place the employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the client.
The full usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Are internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees, going to encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure eventually happens, after much of the diversions, to do priority... what it has always done!
- Then, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the 'neurosciences' - United States and widely disseminated, on their own, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the \"leviers\" (sic) of the engagement of the executives, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr it comforts the leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, inadequate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears as a way to achieve a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their \"social performance\" and restore their human resources management to the area.
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The \"Just War\" is worth praise to Obama on the right
The American right-wing greeted the speech delivered to Oslo on Friday by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of \"just war\" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had broached the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, eerie of the right wing of the Republican party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of war - sometimes necessary - in her memories that had just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she thought.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, one way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done a very good job in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, welcomed the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of \"the existence of evil in the world\" in the presidential statement.
On the one hand, I found this historic speech, Mr. Gingrich said, interrogated during the radio show - The Takeaway -
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen - a left-wing president - remind members of the Nobel Committee - that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist -
For Michael Gerson, former lead by George W. Bush, who became a chronicist in Washington Post, Mr. Obama made a very American speech.
In addition to being a citizen of the world - as he always does - he spoke as an American president - reminding Europeans - that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it - said Mr Gerson.
Among the rare to the right to be unconvinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, described the speech as \"tern, ampoule and without inspiration\" on the National Review Online website.
On the left side of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When one engages the war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable at the President's location.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, described his speech as \"super-production\" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech - it should be a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression - has ignited the California daily life.
Mr. Obama - speaking the right speech - estimated the New York Times, the judge - both in a dark and uplifting manner -
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiating-marathon sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to stay to the end, came to an agreement Friday night that put an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, beginning Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left in the early morning Friday, hoping to sign the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And this is the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11 a.m. to get everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict - it would have been very detrimental to businesses - and he was afraid that he would disrupt the late-year parties - said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low-salaries, from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're leaving from far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We're going to order our militants that there are no locks, no locks from the refuelling centers.
But we can still have some recalcitants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed - a good agreement - even though it was - difficult to grant increases on high wages in view of the international competition -
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed a historic agreement -
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an acceptable compromise.
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that, a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' expenses, was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted on Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote - in identical terms -
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to undertakings belonging to that organization, and secondly to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will be - as soon as possible - assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a \"dope market\" as the EUR 100 million - had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax -
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the dinde eaters of the next revelation, he deplored Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement is likely to - to -crush the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months -
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with the RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between unions and RATP's management left them on hunger as to their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a two-way train on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a four-way train outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which are waiting for 200,000 customers every day, have been delighted that - the RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores -
The RER Across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about one train in two circulated at the peak hours, and almost no ram in rough hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Franciscans being organized.
So in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of college students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had been up an hour thirty earlier to be sure to arrive at the time -
The Saint-Lazare Station did not know of saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of officers and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to reach the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged \"major\" by the unions, of a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which demands a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, indignified the CGT, stressing that management was not fixed to solve a problem while in the roads and the SNCF it was done -
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to - a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession - specified the RATP.
This also meant to the unions that the company was mocking users of the weekend.
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested, in a matter of calm, the meeting.
The conflict threatens to extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the submission of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, including 30 euro variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of the career, range from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the scheduled schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdian party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdian party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which had just extended its hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “fleet of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity” said to the press the President of the Hasim Kiliz Court, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to decide the dissolution, said Mr. Kiliz, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to which Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk were entitled and the confiscation by the party's Treasury of property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as MPs without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the \"directives\" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered to be a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures, however, that it does not have an organic link with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen its rights, to try to tighten the support of the Kurds to the PKK and to put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
From the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populated by a majority of Kurdes.
Order forces fired lacrymogen grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice would - deepen despair -
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, it has declared it to the press.
The government, made up of an Islamic movement party, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed by principle to the closure of the parties.
That's all right, the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the person responsible for road clearing and sanding services (ESFs) makes it clear that this is not to get citizens drunk.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, that might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and freezing.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he went snowing on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures fell below zero, there were 20 major routes (known as routes A).
This includes large-scale streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road base that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3 o'clock in the morning - so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migration begins -
That's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the manager of the road clearing and sanding service - because no motorists are willing to let the sales vehicles pass -
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and desert roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that there are still a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team is on its way to identify the areas deemed dangerous and the crossings as a matter of priority.
As for cycle tracks, the ESF services generally cannot deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 and 4h30.
As the glazing forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
The police also appeal to this special service if necessary.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallale resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped measured about 2 meters long for 1,50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with faucile griffes and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas to Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday, Tawa hallale is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Pangée and was on its way to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us of the relationship of kinship, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt conducted searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells them that he sometimes found a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that part of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him from the name of Tawa according to the Indian word Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all experts in palaeontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but he states that it can confirm some theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making the classification of all early dinosaurs very difficult.
The experts are asked, among other things, at which time the saurians were divided into three major groups: the teropods (carnivores) which include the Tyrannosaure and the velociraptor later appeared and whose birds, the sauropods, quadrupedes along the neck, and those that are related to them and the ornithischian herbivores, which form part of the species such as triceratops and stegosaure.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theologians.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, said S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that the Tawa Hallale had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the descendants of the teropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in Tawa hallale, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theopods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the apparent lineage of the vast sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the sarians appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say, all of the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other therapies that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaure, who lived in Poland today and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give a mistaken view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually no fossils on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs became the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and many other swarians.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the whole planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs have randomly survived while other reptiles have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and were therefore able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteoritis favored by the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since then had existed in the shade: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt waved all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they conceal the police intervention requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art were barricaded with graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories found that the degradations did not justify such a violent intervention on the part of the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses.
Evacuation is an “unacceptable achievement” to the freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism is only a matter of delegitimizing and criminalizing the protest, and trying to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University thus refrained from discussions that would still be essential.
The course officers require that the criminal prosecutions initiated be suspended immediately.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradations.
Legitimization of protests
The Green Union youth in the service sector and the German Confederation of Syndicates (DGB) show solidarity with students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretary of Green Union youth.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and caused for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she said to the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Link Day) did not share that view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the student's arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche Party tabled a motion to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts in Moscow, was, under Soviet rule, a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, a place of Frankfurt science - with university institutes and the societies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday, representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a \"Precise Collaboration Protocol\".
The signatories were Moscow vice-mary Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the great Sironics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a planned socialist city for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation \"Green Town\") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed far enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than \"new heart of Europe\".
If you want it. S21, it is much more than the collapse of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of the Bade-Wurtemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The front-of-line stations, with lanes that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that had the effect of brake sabotage of modern rail traffic because it had to take a long time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure - that's what needs to be done.
This is why linehead stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which Europe's slogan-course -
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, linehead stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route from the intercity line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken it away.
The railway company is part because it is the taxpayer who is responsible for the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that - if we believe the graphics of computer-generated planners - will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, relates indirectly to many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will lack for other points of junction and engorgement in the network.
The list of the Department of Transport refers to all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to fully support the mushroom here.
But project S21 has the effect of a brake sabotage.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is about to become the bottleneck of international goods traffic, and it is in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment of the airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had appointed experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation regarding the night flight ban in the case or the project for the construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would take place.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5h in the morning, as the Land Government intends, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air accidents.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to appeal against the judgement rendered.
The opposition criticized this delay and tried to pressure the representative of the Government to postpone the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan - We keep our promises -
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's allegations that the Land Government is still trying to authorize night flights by using — lawyers and shopkeepers —
It takes time to conduct a precise legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a \"first quick impression\"
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks reimburse the aid allocated
The major U.S. banks, which are very affected by the crisis, are breaking apart from their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The U.S. television chain CNBC reported that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid received.
The banking institutions are therefore seeking to get rid of imposed restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses allocated to the executive and the higher fee settlement.
The Bank of Americaa is launching an increase in capital by selling securities to investors that has paid it $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from banks that are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of the Bank of America, expressly requested to thank American taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the strongest of the financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money in the financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the State.
The U.S. bank could start an increase of $20 billion in capital on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain to the banking community.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything happened faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the decommissioning of the current position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the ZDF German Chain Board of Directors, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editor of ZDF, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to harm ZDF commander Markus Schächter further if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended for five years, but that was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council voted in favour of the re-election of Brender and 7 others voted against. Brender's destitution by vote represented a very predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already let a number of weeks before the vote, did not wish to resume Brender's position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's information emissions had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, stamping out the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had been involved in the debate and who felt that the way Koch acted was unconstitutional.
But it won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the political sciences, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhenanie-Palatinate radio body) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national average).
In 1983 he became a writer in the ZDF, first in the news magazine -heute-journal - (now newspaper).
Then he continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then he was corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was the head and presenter of the \"Morgenmagazins\" (second-monthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin drafting.
After Brender's disgrace, when he was just elected a journalist of the year by the Media Magazin magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent at the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länders should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities from the monitoring committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully managed with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to limoger Brender.
Through this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political partisan on the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked Liberal from left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Part-time success for students: after a year of educational strike the Länder Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the Rector Conference, an agreement was drawn up that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload should be recognised to ensure - realistic and acceptable proportions -
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of reviews between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master channels.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the ministers of Länder's education and university rectors have repeatedly expressed in fashion: \"Studyability\"
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain reviews: “Each module should normally be able to be completed through a single examination” can be read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, said that, by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, one should be able to stop the derapages, which caused considerable damage to the studyability.
The \"studyability\" should be the decisive criterion of the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this burning sensation that sometimes you feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition finds that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should - have the necessary flexibility and flexibility to allow and promote personal initiative -
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be \"re-accredited\" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examinations were not too strict.
In some Länder, specialized universities and higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and the service of international relations
The Länder and the universities therefore provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wished to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, as well as the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the \"studyability\" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of Socialist Students' Union indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy to no longer take place in the future - behind closed doors - of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: - the experience of students is very useful to us - she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and possibility for each Bachelor graduated to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have sufficient places tomorrow for Master's studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore employ more course managers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words \"Come to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ...\" that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he tematizes in bursts of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the chair very coveted as poetry of the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, the theme of which was -The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorted mirror of your security files -
Söllner made a statement, visibly destabilized and embarrassed, in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Security Political Police.
Söllner received the German language price in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner \"so someone who has not been able to resist the security intimidation tests.\"
The poet Werner Söllner is informer Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary embezzlements with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as much as we can say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, secured the specialist of literature Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
\"He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,\" says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however, the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It may be assumed that the victims have made speculations and have sometimes guessed which real names have been hidden in the last names of loan names Sorin, Voicu and Walter as well.
On the contrary of Germany, where, in the meantime, the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continually counterbalanced and slowed down in the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been somewhat delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of Temesvar Security, who, after announcing the award of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expresses himself in a three-in-a-kind way regarding the winner.
She had a psychosis, and finally she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable issues are associated with the Söllner case as this often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been dispossessed? The weighted response of the listeners, to the consent of Söllner, makes it hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On Herta Müller's genesis, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative had arrived there, pulled four pins coming straight from a sympa Christmas party, on which the sport goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted at midnight less the quarter in a C-class Mercedes, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier at hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself - he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness either.
He had a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because it was now that it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just begun three days earlier were clear: \"We have achieved the eighth final\", that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania\" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to return to -
The \"great work\" is waiting for us Sunday.
There, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Sort-out
The eighth final of the Champions League (match up to 16./17. + 23./24 February/ game back 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be fired at 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry into the fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only with the one who had been lucky, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the \"plumbing souls\" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so well that it was no longer effective with nurse Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, said Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter -, -in the football when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have thought possible -
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tries to describe the \" phenomenon\" found by a \"fresh wind\" proverbial and the working method of the new leader: \"He is someone who goes to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.\"
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the lead yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to party, even after the first home win for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview of the goal guard Jens Lehmann had rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would contravene Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused the leadership of weak style and said that she had decided to change as a coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the games had been eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were \"marked by a pure selfishness\" led Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They could no longer be friends for the life of these two quadrogens.
In any case, they agreed for all the rest, i.e. without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, the strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were \"for a great part in success\" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in coeur - and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World heavyweight championship
Warm combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger continually verbally and gesturingly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukrainian defended its title as world champion of heavy weights according to the WBC federation.
To the unanimity of the judges he was required to do so.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the unanimity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian had already won twice the World Champion title of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he did not succeed the KO so expected.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, has to confess twice his defeat because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, ten centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the kicks of the champion, thus pushing Klitschko to get his right-hand ball into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mainly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his coups only rarely won the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded the distance of the 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a \"vial zombie\" who \"is not really capable\".
During the weight Friday, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses so that he could see his eyes.
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-emerged in his fourth fight since his return on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had fought back at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered -sa - WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without combat.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
\"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape,\" Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, wore the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is planning to have this game played at the Wembley stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
SPD and La Gauche parties (La Gauche Day) are asking the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate concealment of certain facts.
The Minister intentionally \"formulated a counter-versity\" on the murder strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information from the ARD-Tagesschau chain (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the flag was in fact, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to take a decision as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Party Renate Künst are of the opinion that Mrs. Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the chancellery, army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery did not in any way influence the military's intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were becoming stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the information of the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some disturbing details from the Minister.
In the midst of the two senior officials, however, it is clear that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The “Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung” reports that Wichert would have requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not obtained an answer.
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament Committee of Inquiry, which was to be formed on the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can unhindered the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, has the experience of a state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in mental patients or in the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes encourages the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and effect distinguish, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, the psychosis and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - break down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 - a great resemblance between madness and dream - for Sigmund Freud the dream was even - a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it -
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes the character of a comic strip.
Its body is in two dimensions with created colors.
Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it lies at the brink of the ceiling.
He's having a good time.
Behind him creatures of winged devils, grinning, bleeding mouth, showing their teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Disgusting, malicious, screaming voices coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of its stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a buffle and loops around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is detached.
That you need lesson, yell the voices in a choir to pull out the tympan. \"Go to a clinic and get careful.\"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffer at least once in its schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalogies, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - the voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, -the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis, is basically retained -
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of the life takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do this sort of cabrioles, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have very little brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not occur for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms.
What is crazy, the psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a point of view question.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled \"The Unreal World in Our Mind\"
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, as well as an impressive number of many other diseases.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is about hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refracted; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognized that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old and lived in a small town in Mecklembourg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A young girl should do her best to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, and she's surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She's awake, listening and seeing this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant sensation, she finds this pleasant young man.
I'm crazy, sometimes she asks.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the table.
At night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or already dreamt, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with blood vessels on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her kiss last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Foolishness is also a work of the art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great that he has hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called father, since she was old to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. “Each experience,” says Kasten, “has taken place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real -
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinguished from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not actual images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness, there is a tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of the change in dream-awakened consciousness.
Oniroid vecuses are very complex half-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and cannot differ from the dream even when it is awake.
The state of Oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in extreme pathologies such as patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware of it, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, it replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us by men not to be confused in the neuter of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book \"Chief Change\" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious departure for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplantation; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created of all parts, visit of foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man ally in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a motorcycle Grecian who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He completely absorbs himself in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these internal travels are fundamentally distinguished from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes in describing what he lived.
In contrast to dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real life.
The intensity of this life blows the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of vigilance.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten - may cause a distortion of what we call reality -
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the PDG post of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, Hubert Burda said, 69 years of age, in Spiegel.
All details have been adjusted in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We also need to see if they are capable of it.
It is not possible to impose 7500 employees on their children without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director General from January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then dealt with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years -
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the family's hands.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have let themselves be trained by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself as a preacher of the country as Springer could and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can wish for, in matters of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the objective of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened up in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious prints such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hairdressing, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, who has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding radius, with in particular a tea lounge, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while looking at the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own Beauty Party with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
A total of 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy can be provided.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual \"trainers\" that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to get all the muscles in the body to work.
And if, after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be open every day from 10 a.m. to 22 a.m.
Miscellaneous cleavages
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the star look to adapt it to our wardrobe.
The form of deceleration, which is very important to highlight silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollety. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the \"LIVE Office\".
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The \"LIVE Office\" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MODEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 « electric cities »
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa participates in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interview \"a future of tranquility\" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is interviewing \"a future of tranquility\" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
\"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our major production sites,\" said the President of the Government.
\"Through this plan and the decision of the trade marks to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,\" he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Motor Sector (IPA), devoted EUR 800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was both intended for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in conjunction with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan resulted in a 6 per cent reduction in average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which rose by “40 per cent” in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pavilion de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collection cars, but you will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds connected to the world of the engine.
For example, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, additions, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, auto sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Cup-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Classics, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior fitness test
However, the commercial activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: gathering, sporting exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Ability tests with cars and collecting motorcycles will also take place on a circuit that is designed outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not upset with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, named i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 250 horse petrol engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note she has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have an excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the set formed by the control board and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as vivid colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic style.
That is why we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
By continuing with the habit, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
It adds to all this a large chest to the regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two litre and 150 horse petrol engine and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, low noise, benefits and control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its mastered consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes, among other elements, bi-xenon adaptable beacons and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury \"First\"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever bloated us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our \"Pe\", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designed it as one of the products of the year.
Indeed, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
Due to its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his U.S. brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it's like to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to access its mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly seductive and has been working for a long time.
Some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had a little noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to enable them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no charge.
It is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
Not that I saw him buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of that colour, she chose the same to accompany him at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was wearing a very similar model on both occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow to the green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
Although at first glance, it would appear that the first lady in the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth for the taking of function, on the other hand, it would bring to Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green, medium heel shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden, model this time.
The hair change too: the hair is now raised while it was carried away the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is reflected in the study \"Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain\", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in marriage and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or work unsteady, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, refuse to enter into married life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having been married. This figure goes to 4.1 in those working in the public sector. \"These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which led them to put away the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the starting date of the common life\", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the difference between the marriage age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and their first child is late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
\"Another differentiation also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed basic studies marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have done middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to achieving stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child,\" said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will embodie the image of several brand products, filling up the universal motto \"Because I'm worth it well.\"
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, has joined other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
UK fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
Former Mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Mannequin of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's poker ace
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty \"radiographs\" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and learned genres (summated biographical, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not save the losers or the lighting.
Delightful, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and readings.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
On Albert Camus: \"In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse that I felt without naming it: the pleasure of funest destiny, the morale without guilt and innocence without any god.\"
On Samuel Beckett: \"Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humour, lacking meaning, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him.\"
On Graham Greene: \"Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasts 13 years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the sky through the path of perdition.\"
On James Joyce: \"Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be engraved by the north side, on which the best climbers still leave and always take.\"
On William Faulkner: \"He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness.\"
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: \"This writer collected the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the 20th century, in his literary form, and made it in the escape of himself and invoking the postéeriority with a violent speech to the asticotes.\"
About Dorothy Parker: \"One day she got on her knees and prayed, \"God beloved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.\"
On Joseph Conrad: \"On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: \"The sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tires death rabid.\"
On Virginia Wolf: \"In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally accepted that she told her that Edward VII was between the eagles or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a nevrose whose literary talent surpassed madness.\"
Sur Pío Baroja : \"What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to inspire this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?\"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of Fuenlabrada city, when a group of 15 to 18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without a word, they stabbed her two feet that left the dog badly injured.
Our outrage is immense because we don't see what's funny about attacking a defenseless little animal for free, which was also left out.
It must be added to this the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energomene who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the local police station, even though we doubt that this is a good thing and that we do not touch the sensitivities, we just want to state that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens in young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education has been and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly in the younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet's port, since it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which \"goes beyond the design and manufacture of safer products\" and stated that it contributed to this goal by other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet port incentive campaign, under the motto \"To be or not to be\", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure its widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety \"is a constant concern\" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfaf and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be encouraged, since the reference for comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a 60 per cent decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from tourist cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect the most their demand have not, in fact, been dissipated. Although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases due to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions on the limitation of bank credits, other factors must be added such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic environment.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it was recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles (rooms and buses).
The concessionaires' association foresees a year similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS brake anti-locking system and as will be done with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory component on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even though, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all of their strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one-on-four disaster with wounded would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejected until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April - probably April 8 - according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to conclude Opel's relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, said that each item in the plan had been previously approved by the party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, is postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, is important.
In case there would have been no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
To the Porsche Boxster Spyder's wheel
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to fine-tune it with nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to pass, first, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a hand-held roof, allowing them to reduce from 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of gains, to mount sports baccets, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they renounced the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the handles with handles in fabrics, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads in the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
Decreased weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplob.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles to a low speed for the time required, until we asked him to sprint, slow down, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is specified, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound from engine at will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the \" sport\" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine's roughness, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stop or at recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely acted on all the way, while on some turns we found the verglas in the morning and the gravel, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light, funnier car to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer shows her face of bad girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a \"Bad Girl\" or \"It Girl\", it's a \" Bag Girl\".
Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a striking triumph at 91-82 during his tour on the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show which, with eight baskets with three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three marked points, largely determines the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, it was assumed that they had jumped into the Israeli field with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamations and applause of return to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noted as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the \"less six\" evaluation of Splitter was already making sense that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilians.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track to pause, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that they didn't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to Elias' hand, they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being killed, needed to chain some skilled actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged that, with three baskets with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas handed the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by mistake, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
In Greece, Unicaja has lost bruyamously in front of the Olympics and has given him the head of Group B of the Euro league, during a match marked by the absence of players from Unicaja, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the rival's size, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to dream the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who embellished the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the internal game of Bourosis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fighting, between the North American Beverley and Williams drivers led to disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on Unicaja.
The inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
Impossible rebound
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed himself superior and even equalled the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group head lucky.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point baskets of Cook, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when players pressured and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in bringing the score up to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you pay from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know how much they would earn on the basis of their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicle ads in Spain.
The tool \"How much should you be paid?\" calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week that the application has been working, the search engine has found that, as a rule, the Spanish worker \"feels poorly paid\", explained in a statement to Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros per year and one French, 31,059, while one Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 euros per year in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are that of driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reversed President will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that \"Mel\" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since 21 September, before that date.
\"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, after his term of office, he must seek another destination.\"
The channel also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: \"My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,\" Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After a few pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty has emerged again, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to fine-tune the debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close to zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilized.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without jeopardising their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand on the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing an inverse reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a flight towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the refuges chosen by investors, leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's are threatened with a further revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not wrong to silence the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to cause a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to give its place to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case in Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot with roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decline and ours continued to increase, then it would be an idiosyncrasic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators obligate most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are responsible with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not hope much for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being \"prudence is a mother of happiness\".
Sectors connected
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Members, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the sub-committee, at eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million up to 2020 and €60,000 more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants today are still operating.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for the recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are also needed, with other \"support energy\".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with his company's demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is a \"long-term clear bet\" in this regard, despite the \"on-the-spot\" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although in the long term, must begin to be taken, as they will take some time before they are mature and that a stable monetary framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial subsidiary for airport services on land, will play the privileged role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to carry out energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Actiona contested its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Actia fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated $1,700 million Australian tunnel (approximately EUR 1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are rivals.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, such is the option to allow Actia to settle in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The City Hall wishes to be able to do so by the end of 2014.
Having chosen public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounted to US$ 1 700 million (approximately EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase faced three consortia, with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The named group Transcity is led by Actia, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest specialists in European underground work.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and final consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who has in turn the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large jobs and privatisations, but entering it is a great challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an invalid step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just acquired a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Million-year assets
It has taken action on a geographical area of the greatest importance to the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park in Victoria, Waubra (192 MW) and leads the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing the desaliminator of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road toll, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the said Northern Link (northern region), is called to link the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The administrative schedule indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll path will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide $500 million in Australian dollars (€308 million) for funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief amply fruitful, which mentioned yesterday a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre optical network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has submitted the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane City. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more precisely in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 kilometres long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore was awarded Renfe's ad
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that presented themselves to the invitation to tender organized by Renfe, including four of which were finalists, including TBWA who had been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the countryside.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased as the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivism.
An Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone subsidiary followed the trail of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, Orange's app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs who have spent the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory; it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to hit the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern de Munich, the two teams who also charged the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And this, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with respect to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, three England and two Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for distributing the money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (parmi which the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who succeeded in participating received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game played.
There is also a win bonus (800 000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of the finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, in the face of 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça paid 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are dedicated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion placed 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29,9 % of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public acquisition offer (POA) for all securities.
In fact, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Sos' shares ended yesterday at EUR 1.85; New Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the designation of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has ensured that it has not been informed of this offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos has claimed that it has made contact with the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay outside of any offers of purchase and going and coming judicial from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision by the first woman to take a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar societies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos will reveal new diversions of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's OPA exclusion submitted by Investora Mer
The National Stock Market Commission (NMV) yesterday authorized the Exclusion OPA submitted by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented as \"sufficient\", following the amendments applied on December 2.
CNMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 per cent of the share capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao scholarships.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, and that they could in no way be transmitted before the completion of the offer, which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use such systems.
The service and solution providers for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then processing them and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other competing companies in the area of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, as each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price recorded.
In addition, a \"smart\" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a massively sold model, work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has complete information about 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audadex has eight centers distributed around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer different products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on countries, there are also tools for the management of cassava parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not offer it in our country, but she does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for evaluation of the claims, aimed at experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it only ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it has come out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open-ended Internet professional server that allows you to engage on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a trade mark have gone to the garage for a break or how many have suffered serious injuries for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the evaluation of car claims, locks or maintenance.
The Evaluation GT Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and has made a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex, for his part, was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solara Group (Audatex, Sidexa, ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was a stock exchange of $1,000 million, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been a member of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and sinister special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and operates over 650 000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 were carried out in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed may no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex processes.
Four-step garage work
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential component of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terraneans, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary piece is selected.
The user may include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
At present, the company Audadex works to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see as a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow you to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
