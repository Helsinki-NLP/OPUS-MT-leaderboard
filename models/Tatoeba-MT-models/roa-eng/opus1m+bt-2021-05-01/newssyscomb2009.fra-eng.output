Right-wing populists' triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's election leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the votes, has ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the electors cast them out visibly for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations concerning the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chanceler Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday, at the extraordinary board of party management.
Such a development would make it easier for the result of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separates itself) from a common government, which even raises sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently puts this development on.
The last party to have access to the Parliament being the Greens, but they lost slightly and returned, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth position.
Obviously, no other party is crossing the four per cent limit and does not access the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool down
If the problem of the accused Czech researchers in India, accused of illegal cockroach of cafards, could not be resolved, it would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said so today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
\"If the problem had not been resolved, then, yes, some cooling would occur,\" he noted after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, speaking out of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He nevertheless mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
\"The problem could be solved,\" said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for release on bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms, that his partner is speaking in the same direction also during the talks.
\"He advises to appeal to a higher court, following which he may be graced,\" said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons - competent legal support - mentions the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
\"We wish above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it, - Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said in ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
\"We consider the incarceration and charge of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt,\" he said.
The Minister would avoid the question if he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
\"I have already received a sufficient number of promises,\" he says.
A Czech arbitrates the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area, however, is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea.
His head, the division's director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, followed the presentation and completion from time to time.
The ardor to work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known to date, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which can contain the key to developing a cancer drug.
A larger fund than the earth closes
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is, above all, the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
To simplify, the part of the seabed and its basement, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the said exclusive economics - explains Mikulka.
The request that the country submits to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of continental shelf should be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and metrosis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has addressed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful, says Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced global rebound.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
In turn, other countries will make their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic background, proclaimed by the Convention - common patrimony of humanity -
There, no State enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is attributed by an international institution established by the Convention.
\"We are not mistaken, the seabed is not an Klondike,\" said Director Mikulka, stating that \"its areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract\"
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former L'Est country bloc within the framework of the common organisation -Interoceanmetal -
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from some other states, the status of the one called a pioneer investor was obtained.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area covered by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
‘It is possible to extract it from an extent with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, - an enumeration of Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a creation.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's assistance in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units remained ready, but they never went to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists taken from Egypt are being revealed.
According to indications from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police and Federal Criminal Police Office Air Squad, as well as Technischen Hilfwerk's logistics experts were at the release site.
As the Ministry spokesperson communicated Monday evening, German forces were not finally required, hostage takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted aid from Germany to integrate it on-site as a support force.
Fortunately, it did not arrive so far, a spokesperson from the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, hostages were relocated to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage takers has so far remained vague, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have arrived safely in the meantime and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine - Bild - the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus from the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the Government's bailout plan for financial markets.
Despite all the calls of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of the two parties, the program that had to juggle the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partyers had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the real good of this heavy plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called on Members to vote in favour even though the plan was unpopular.
\"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet arrived,\" he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could capitulate.
He came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, he fell again.
Experts now project new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to come into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to reservations for the next few months according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, growing numbers of reservations already dominate in the autumn.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, with the RVD.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since late August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the HRD said.
There, the increase in reservations would be about one-third.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our area, would be particularly sought by the Germans.
The organized trips were particularly requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food prices, the costs would be - easier to calculate for the customer than for an individual trip -
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts of early reservations or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very low so that an increase in sales figures would be re-registered compared to last year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits continuously, beer in litre pickets and celebrities in Tyrolian designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV animator and wears a custom-cut Tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally living north of the Ecuador of Weißwurst, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Thérèse Square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemous or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolian costume reaps a few odd-eyed blows at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I would have misattached my apron: \"on the left means free, in the virgin environment, on the right hand of the house, on the rear of the widow.\"
Discreetly, I tripatoule my loop from the back to the left.
\"It's better,\" she said, \"and laughs at me.
Others don't get as bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it's written \"Too drunk to get dressed\" and expose us to their bare back-train without being invited to it.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds this - Gorgeous - with a -oooo - elongated.
He tells me all this after he's been relieved of the cup he drank before.
Right next to that burning mouth that everybody thinks is a garbage dump.
Bob is therefore one of these \"wild weights\" - sadly famous.
Others don't have a chance to get rid of alcohol like this.
At eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers are running on the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses, rather, intervene in mouta - always by four, they drag their civière covered with tented tents.
It works like this for most of the visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get full.
Those who rest in the coffins under the bench are not visible.
\"These are those who can no longer swallow anything,\" cried one of the rescuers in response to my question, and then disappeared in the melee.
Police-identified accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday after noon, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then she died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey widens its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its back country.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 cannot be, of Asia, one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is located on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with a tour of observation at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of the region around it, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the Empire's forces went beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
The Turkish sources declare this to be sabotage.
Since then, it falls slowly into ruins, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolie and all the points of orientation, serves at least symbolically, to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the region around it, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has outstanding relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suat Kinilioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a trip of 10 and a half hours, shook on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and by numerous bakeries in which the middle managers in costume-cravate- men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-center politician from anywhere else in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly - he said.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with either one.
She was supposed to do both.
\"But here, at some point, I asked if Turkey should choose.\"
\"Turkey,\" he said, \"does not want to have a choice between the two\"
He then stressed one aspect that almost all those I was able to talk to, quoted me by heart: the Turkish railway does not go only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore both an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a metaphorically travelling Europe on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I repeated to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called the \"sick man of Europe\" -
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon-Tod-Handley (deceased September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting from his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include the under 21s, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to give up the choir.
The name \"Proteus\" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any kind of music was presented to him, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remind yourself of how Tod repeated us to - let the music speak for itself -
He would have said, \"The composer knows what he wants.\"
It's all there in the music.
So sing -
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, although never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named knight, that's right, Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962 to 1982 decades, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley was so rare in this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, focus only on some people.
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (deceased September 25th) states that, in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Normal research in 1950, while he was a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
That's what came out of Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and ended at the same time, a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
\"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino - the Flamenco and life - because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments -
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
A few refined mechanics are added, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market.
First, it is observed that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Particularly in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years, is located in the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand traded 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought about selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has traded 8,000 Jazz since 2002 representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch officials hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pay a large share of the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's owners hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, is a 16% drop in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the company expects to market almost 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
On the basis of markets and estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters in addition), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions also increase and the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the chest - which has a double-bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the first-generation chest.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Jazz 1.2L wave box is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz which would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 nm of torque at 4,900 tr/min.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz was 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, in imitation of bee theft, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research in Science and Advanced Technologies at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks very much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are within a distance of two metres and within 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, \"explain Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Deplacement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
Each second, this device must only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain information or intuitive logics of pre-manufacturing, that is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about giga-bytes of memory, or even megabytes.
This is the first because of the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they have created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
It's like 'the hotel of bad credits'... or stories.
The luxuriant aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance to his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a strong drop in its Bourse course.
A week after an interim agreement was unveiled, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the regular Morgan Stanley shares at the unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The selected price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities providing a yield of 10% and with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, 28% above its current course.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” explained John Mack, the U.S. Group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but put him under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's greatest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, that participation would be entirely made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves -
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they trade more than 50% over the conversion price, or approximately 47 dollars, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A group spokesperson, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he's been clean - adjusted his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its Bourse course melt by half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was running.
This cost went back on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other (surviving) major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the repurchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that he raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted - yes - to the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the \"no\" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of the \"yes\" between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The \"Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,\" he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), dealt with a text in 444 points consolidating the \"new socialism\" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the \"planning of development\" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies sending its emigrants.
The project, elected by Correa in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and would fight a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the ravistors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday healthy afternoon and excepted in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in \"good health\" - and - no ransom was paid - to the ravistors - said on the tarmac the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Captured on September 19 during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one cache to another by 35 unknown ravistors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 members of the special forces, sent on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
\"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the ravistors were killed, the others fleeing,\" said the manager who requested the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lighting unit had been sent to the Sudan in total, where they received the support of German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where it is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
\"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces,\" he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol on which the ravistors were on board, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Kingdom Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which had immediately denied the movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking over the headlines and is in the current election campaign.
That's good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the misery of small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that create hunger?
Which politician would remind the federal government of neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and that, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Québec History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with exploring history, preserving with three under the private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When did a forum for history and heritage take place?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to assist the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, up to a sum of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution which also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has expanded for more than a year, is for the Fortis bank. In a sense, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigoous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the out-Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, to be at the origin of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as the new Director General.
The financial organization also sought private buyers, but had not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank's client circle and no agency has been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
\"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's in the process of entrusting its hen to a fox - Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage the prescriptions of drugs, in the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of damage, the health status of the client, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they knew the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it provides easily with pharmacies, data on the purchase of drugs of the person in the 18 months that have passed. From that point on, the program determines itself, what disease the person is suffering from and what its health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high blood fat rate, which puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer other than the paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program, it is found that a drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat bubbles, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravated risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis, and should ask the patient for permission before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
Since then, they are constrained by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past shortcomings.
Recently, some companies have also processed laboratory analysis results and linked them with the data on drug use, thus being able to provide an even more precise picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the sole agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance agreement with her.
Thus and ultimately, the hens depend on the kindness of the fox.
Marseille's global menu
The European Union and India are multiplying by two of their trades.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidature as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not take too long to this issue yesterday, at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they were going to multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not appear to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and thus air trade will also be able to expand in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and there was an urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on the subject.
The completion of the Doha business cycle has also been sought, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be made at the next year's climate conference, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State now goes to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he prepares to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand exhibit titles, and Turkey as an honored guest.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: Italy will be presented institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, in butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing relative to the total Italian production, and in particular to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fosset's plane, the missing billionaire a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 metres above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, raised the remaining doubts: \"The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it's a good thing about the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared,\" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore specified that no human remains were found either on the plane or around the area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered deceased .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the search of the wreck, a team of investigators sent to the site, identified the device: it was Bellanca 8kcab, which was missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without a stopover.
Of all these records, also the one that stole at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the ordinary of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the \"compact\" road offs of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus the advertising battling that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the Innovative Technology Delete8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group - Ultras Italy - which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, has never created any big problems.
He never even got into a fight with the opposing typosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
Proponents come from Triveneto.
Of Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (often) of Campania and Poilles were added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so that they could not be identified.
They are inspired by the English typos.
In Bulgaria, they found a typoserie of real Nazistists, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian typos, 144 tickets for the party: all nominatives, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian typosis who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it may be possible that the typos arrested or identified in the disorders provide a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stage.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is to say that others may be added to the first hundred and fifty.
\"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize that which behaves in this way,\" said the Viminal.
So, keep your eyes open, especially in view of the national team game on Wednesday in Lecce -
In the Poilles there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deal exactly with stadium issues.
“The Duke-Duce choirs, and the arm held during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime”
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's (expressed in a very unfriendly way) opinion, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Taggliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhus was shameful.
\"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory No.1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about the anthem of Mameli: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they aren't cops.
