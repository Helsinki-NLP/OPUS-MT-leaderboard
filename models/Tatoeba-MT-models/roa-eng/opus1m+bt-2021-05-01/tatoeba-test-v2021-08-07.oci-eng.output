You can fuck all the flying people.
You can choose the book you like.
You can choose whatever it is about eths.
You can choose how to free yourself.
You can choose what you want.
That's better for you.
Let's get you shot.
May I thank you.
It's past the redhead.
The healthy tones that are true.
Your hair is too long.
That you seem to love the grass.
I'll make sure you keep the bar.
It's gonna take you long to sleep.
I'll shut you up and tell the truth.
He arrived too late at the tribal.
They made fun of you.
It'll make it easier for you to study with me the year I'm coming.
