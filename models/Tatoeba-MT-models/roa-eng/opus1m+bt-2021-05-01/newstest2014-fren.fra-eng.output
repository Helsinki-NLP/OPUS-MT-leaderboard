Spectacular jumps in Şwingsuit - above Bogota
The sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped a helicopter on Thursday above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it went up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3,000 metres above the altitude, where many badads had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While road planners in the United States have a hard time finding the money needed to repair the decrepit highway infrastructure, many are the ones who come up with a solution in the form of a small black box that sits above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all thousands of motorists and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and the government offices of planning to reorganize the obsolete system of funding of major American roads.
The generally uninterested sector in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a lively debate and moving alliances.
The libertarians joined ecological groups to put pressure on the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the thousands you travel on, and possibly of the road on which you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax law.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about privacy.
And while members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of routes.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental tour.
This is really necessary for our nation.
\"It's not like we had the choice,\" said Hasan Ikhrata, director-general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which foresees that the state is beginning to record the thousands of routes by every Californian car driver by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they did before.
Cars can ride more than a thousand with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
\"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable,\" said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
\"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term,\" he said.
Wunks calls this a mileage use fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the citizens' Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay in the mile.
\"It's not just a tax going through a big black hole,\" said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go in the way of payment at the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of the rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many thousands every day to go to work or to town.
Several States and large cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These motorists will soon pay to the state kilometric costs instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states away from the East American coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their minor actions and actions.
\"The concerns about Big Brother and that sort of thing are a big problem,\" said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: \"It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-location devices.\"
It is not necessary to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep the records of the daily goings and comings of people.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many thousands drive a car, but without knowing the exact time or place.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to make use of a small California startup named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She sought to penetrate the emerging market of car insurance, in which drivers would pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the devices she tests have a lot of use for large axis planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
\"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record and locate them,\" said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less costly ways and methods of doing so that are far less intrusive.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have equipment at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are looking to develop a charging system that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide \"car payment\" insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
\"Cars would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,\" said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on mile payment is simply not a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual fee could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that each pays its fair share.
\"It is not necessary to use radical surgery when simply needing aspirin,\" said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs with the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unpublished listening
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he won a luxury reissue scheduled for 4 November, with several new ones.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to have the pop scene sparked.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he cooked a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives an avant-taste of its new Atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and wisely mastered rock electricity.
New editions already heard
But Atomic is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a luminous ride that slows down gradually to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even in Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddy, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again made reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, greedy, are eager to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun in any case playing chameleon with these titles: turn-over informer, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals at once, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, of the Louis Vuitton brand, which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that, before their release, members of the army would follow a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the \"universality of service\" rule of the army requiring that staff be able to perform a range of various tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins emphasized that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
\"I told them I wasn't ready,\" he said during an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has hardly determined what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not capable of fighting.
Under current rules, severely injured soldiers are up to three years old to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that, among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesperson Jim Karygiannis called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while New Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of this shameful practice.
Disney put on tablets to launch a animated series
The American Media and Entertainment Group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney Group channels is only planned in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the West American where she makes order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
\"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,\" commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience comes within the framework of Disney's efforts to - extend the life span of his series and build new relationships with his audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important - he added.
An early week survey by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already served a tablet or telephone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago respectively.
Snowden is ready to \"co-operate\" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said, \"Although the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.\"
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, said to Zeit Online: \"If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.\"
Relations between the United States and Germany were severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had been listening to the German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who runs the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness \"without endangering and completely ruining relations with the United States,\" it had to be enjoyed.
Mr Ströbele, Member of Parliament Green German, published a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in \"security\" there, said the Member.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a \"serious and sustained\" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to \"my act of political expression\".
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials, including the United States, felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of ongoing surveillance was of public use.
The letter proposes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities \"when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved\".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix on request video service via their television in the future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
\"This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options,\" said Cogeco CEO Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step to its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date with regard to this new platform.
\"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail,\" said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussion with some major cable owners to make its service available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during their Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
\"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages, it doesn't work,\" said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
\"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television,\" said Cogeco's p.-d.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable operator, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they had a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, it is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the other with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horsemeat has been detected in beef-based cans of cans sold by two small British low-price distribution mills, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA of up to 1 to 5%.
\"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been present in the product,\" explained the British agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the examinations of the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four wounded, early Friday, on Route 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4h, a motorist traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valeis, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6:00, Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them at the descent of the aircraft.
New hand luggage charges are for bags placed in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if the travellers only paid at the boarding door once.
The Frontier spokesperson, Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
\"We don't want to make this price pay,\" she explained.
Airlines began to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much things as they could in the hand luggage arranged in the upper compartments, so there was often no longer room in these compartments.
These fees are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley stated that these new fees will not really serve to collect money.
It is about making the most loyal Border customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a border boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the website and border registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand luggage charges will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often worry about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them have not affected the baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Alligating company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage charges were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former framework of Midwest Airlines, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.
\"I've never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire career,\" he said.
I was expecting to see toothbrushes and a fight burst out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, \"the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning\".
Border also acts as a Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the open can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned to the rear seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed.
Border's decision to pay for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travelers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of to an online travel agency.
However, the Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums by thousands of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-thousand frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home town, Denver, but his activity goes backwards and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9 per cent and flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to reassess Border's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an \"internal error\" and not computer pirates for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shade said Friday that it was a bug that caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed it online.
\"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that took place during a planned update,\" said the spying agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was \"not at all\" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the system concerned.
The NSA has once been oversecret, once nicknamed the \"No Such Agency\", been under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs - which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former misappropriated NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to drop her employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, met individual employees to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains Regional Director of Working Relations of Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The Delta closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
He either reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
“Or he sold it to someone else, and that’s what happened,” says Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling about 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, - Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee -
Having thrown the sponge with failures in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of North Amiens promised to the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the U.S. tyre Titan, declares today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After having abandoned the plant's purchase project in January, you are back today.
You'd pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of \"you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you- work three hours\" a day, unions-fucking-for-the-CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxes and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disabled France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are worked.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to enlarge.
Why does Titan so much need this factory?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and competent workers, this is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had given employees good severance pay since the factory closure was announced, I believe that 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
So Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep Amiens' factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in North Amiens more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while delivery and flight orders recede
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a fall of 15% of its net profit on Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and of contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his entire new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious schedule of commercial service prior to September.
After the opening flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the aircraft only stole three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecasts and the course of action declined by 8 per cent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from \"surperformance\" to \"sector performance\" due to the low growth potential of the stock exchange in the next quarter or two quarters.
\"Although the decrease in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division,\" said Cameron Doerksen in a customer note.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was released in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm controls for CSeries aircraft is modest so far up to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the on-the-fly tests to validate the company's assertions regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new airline.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Head of Management, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial service of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday by indicating that the program was progressing in line with the timetable.
\"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected,\" said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the time of the aircraft's termination.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will be reproduced throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company indicated.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that he was assessing the timeframe for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
\"This slow flight tests - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,\" said Doerksen.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 Md.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division represented $32.9 Md as at 30 September, a figure that was unchanged from 31 December of the previous year.
\"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,\" said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues dropped by 13% to $2.M.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to 2.1M.
The Transport Division's order book totalled $32.6 Md at 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from implementation problems with respect to some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a decrease of 10% of its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23 and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a gouffre under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, we learned Friday from the Emergency Speleo of the Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to practice and the other did not, went under ground Thursday at 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
Then we had no news of them since, he specified the same source.
\"The speleologists should have come out around 5:00 a.m.,\" said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the emergency department.
Tens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians from the French Emergency Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
“This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, sent the information to one of the emergency teams involved in the network,” says Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of Chambéry's Alpine Hunters were found - exhausted but not injured -
They got lost in the network, went back on their way, waiting for the help, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services the following day for new revelations on the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid to new order the use of Google and Yahoo search engines and messengers,” she says in a press release.
She judges - scandalous - the information of the Washington Post, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass information by infiltrating the international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The research done by journalists is also confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” added Michael Konken, union president who claims 38,000 members.
Feux repèints: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project of ‘relifting’ - signalling lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
To recall, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in Brussels on Thursday, in Brussels, to repaint 16 flagships of the region's blue and yellow colours in Brussels.
The goal being both - to increase security - and - the Brussels identity -
The idea is, in the end, to review all Brussels signalling lights, for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is \"too dark\" - according to the Brussels Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of \"flammandization\" of the capital and demands the \"dismission\" of Brigitte Grouwels.
“Not happy to spend the money of the Brussels in redeploying operations of the color signalling portals of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his Flemish operations of the Capital,” Mr. De Bock said in a press release.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles in dark blue-yellow.
According to the Member, there is now no - no difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels -
The Brussels deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program itself.
It's a long time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
“For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes being 0.5% of the Brussels!” concluded Mr. De Bock.
the portico de Pont-de-Buis demonté
The portico ecotax of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Some cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national side was diverted into the ashtray.
The decision of the decommissioning, announced by the Finistère Prefecture Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomovav, the manager of the portique.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports in the Finistère department, the other two being dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the connected glasses signed by Google.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibre or an intra-atrial listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the living world.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue it -
There is no recipe, no way of using it to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me anymore, set on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found her body empty, screamed on that hospital bed with cold sheets.
Likewise, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by little day or night appearances, a little shy, somewhat erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and liberated the person I loved, and here I found her, full and full.
This shift from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, \"inside as outside,\" he seems.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I had a bad time...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased were not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I constantly feel them near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams take me to the contrary and register in my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the night of my ultrasound where I was supposed to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was standing out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the level and he smiled and he was glad that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with me what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I would like to share with him this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor I was at the time.
I've still done my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a large school, have not, with the decline, been anodized choices.
In fact, I often heard it speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she taught me are always present, so that I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and rightness of mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased.
Only the lack, the lack of response, the need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me of her mildness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and she looks at me.
Every morning, I see his restless eyes resting on me, I see the circles that lighten his gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig up the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead in the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes around.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little again to smile, and to say his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites herself into my dreams when the morals are a little overtaken.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the downturn of time makes us realize how much she was head of orchestra and we are trying to stay in the path she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his own, I still wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is he genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
So soon my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that invaded me then, of course, has lessened but it is always near me.
Very often it \"debarches\" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that at awakening I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me - I went down - but with such a real voice that I woke up in the open, worried and lit the head lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I go back to see if it's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we have been happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I come out, I am my grandmother, I have plenty of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the most bloody month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
\"We don't tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,\" Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will extend, and what happens in Syria will also extend.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Dita, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addition would not be revealed on a large day's basis.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assassins.
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Dita, 42, was providing sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug trafficking activities after having compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed \"Bash\" and considered by criminals to be a \"first-of-the-art case\", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers identified Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Barehouse dinner with fellows.
Investigations revealed that Dita was a \"regular consumer\" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illegally to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Dita, 42 years old, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would not be revealed by day.
Today, at the Liverpool Assassin Court, Dita, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, fell into disrepute after being convicted of two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him coming to Dita's home and placing drugs, just 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Dita who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a guesthouse at the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and called nine times.
The court heard that Dita was a \"regular consumer\" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a \"legal privilege\".
During his arrest, Dita picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and he was taken a hair sample.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace and that he had clients calling him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, \"If anyone needs to know that the law should not be violated, it's a criminal lawyer.\"
Mr. Detta was accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But that went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Detta did not honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He came too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed himself to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, \"If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.\"
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, \"Mr. Detta has gone from criminal counsel to criminal himself as he has begun to procure drugs from criminal organizations.\"
His cocaine addiction has forever compromised him and made him vulnerable to the thoughts of the leading members of organized criminal groups who have commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of confidence with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation on Mr. Dita, who was found guilty of the three heads of charges of possession of cocaine and now impeding justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of the complicity of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.

Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a coat of light: one could rub the hot shot in Menton with the bill of lighting.
Invoice, which, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, and not by associations of traders.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the perpetrator of the firefighting.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff have wandered to the exits or to the tarmac.
Soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that has had a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five skirts imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a high dose of humour, it is possible for adolescents to learn the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Kingdom Lyric Art Society will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room filled with the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the Olympic Opera, the concert-beneficial held last August, with the support of the soprano colortura Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of La Chauve-souris.
Without providing precise figures, the president of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well established, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
\"Fundancies are floating and we hope to last up to the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will go through in seven years,\" commented the administrator.
\"I would say even beyond,\" added General Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threat profession, weapon-bearing in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
\"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,\" said Corporal Bert Paquet by means of a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to come to court Friday.
New Request for Collective Appeal against the Brothers of Saint Croix
A new application for collective redress was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have occurred this time at the Oratory Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the complainant, identified as \"J. J,\" who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Sumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratory, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed only at three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: “I, I was at such a place, can I register?” says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has in particular allowed the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Brothers of Sainte-Croix.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stressed that the Congregation of Saint Croix and the Saint Joseph Oratory, which is a separate entity, - allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children - that they exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims - that they were aware of the sexual abuse they had committed and nevertheless choked them - and that they consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problem -
The latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Ms. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives in this regard by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the step of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second step is taken, or the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicable before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the arrondissement of LaSalle, in Montreal, from Thursday to Friday.
The relief was called around 1 a.m., Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself on the basement of an Indian cooking restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rue Réjane.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the scene took about an hour to master the brewer.
The fire has caused significant damage to the structure of the building, and has indicated the Chief to the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the stage.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty houses, on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily accommodated, said the SIM.
Many opposition to medical help dying at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, held this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote on the principle of the bill on medical assistance to be killed in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
\"What is the meaning of life,\" she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, felt that the service would be useless in any way.
We're never asked, \"I want to die, give me an injection.\"
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's going to mess up.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphane Vallée, says that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
\"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask yourself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?\" said the newspaper, challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
\"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it,\" said Cyrus Kamau, Chief Executive Officer of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court \"will always be biased because it is a government extension\" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
\"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it to the parliamentarians,\" he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have \"mainstream over the media.\" The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya \"had been hit hard\" and the bill was stamped out as \"draconian\".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities' anger by broadcasting video surveillance camera images on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack derided the luxury trading centre.
The chief of police, David Kimiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the convocation was withdrawn following an uprising of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being \"radiated\" or of being unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, \"even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations.\"
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's \"animated blogosphere\".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want in complete impunity.
\"No one will ever know,\" wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Submitted to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and harvesting.”
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their giraffe wages of about 532,000 shillings per tax-free month, which are among the highest in the world.
A Difficult Year for Pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to Laval's Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) has resulted in a complete echo to the management of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmacy department found itself highly deficient in staff.
Almost 30% of the workforce was missing, making this financial year very difficult, according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time hired pharmacist.
We didn't use the clearance, said Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced to a level, the time that things are moving.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacia residents] in order for them to come and stay here.
There is a competition for circumstances that has caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the pharmacy department of CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students currently living in Laval also decided to remain employed by CSSS.
Now, it's going much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore close our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have a environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always run on three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more, and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The top model of 22 years does not start his career at the cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This huge porn drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two sections (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrogen acro sex since its adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with her elder is striking: a brindille silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one who did not hesitate to pose naked on ice paper will show up in much more sulphurizing situations on large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudding in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the doubling.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, going through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing his actresses into their last rematches, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Narbonne Méga CGR, as a precautionary measure, as a result of squeezing the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned firefighters of a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people have left the meeting.
The people were examined and full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad fun on the bottom of a tear jet?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that the director of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients in depth.
The room was aired and everything went into order.
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers have regained the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruits.
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in the canopy on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger baggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been spread into three pre-emptive citroulills.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCG) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation, Jacqueline Roby said, the CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since early 2013, border service officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border service officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range ground-air missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aviation into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances almost identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed an Israeli attack on CNN, this time targeting the Yakhont ground missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation from seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt note goes to \"B-\" and focuses on the speculative investment category.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance over three that it is re-lowed by one year.
\"The government's strategy is less and less likely to provide enough foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs,\" says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and plans that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities resort massively to support local currency, hryvnia, sinking, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter following contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficits, has been calling for the aid of the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had granted it a loan of $15.3 billion and has now released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted fiscal reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that “significant external financing needs” were “vulnerability” and “signs of economic improvement”
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, - a short-term improvement cannot be expected -
\"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year - presidential elections will be scheduled in 2015,\" says the expert, interrogated to the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the \"uncertainty\" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is subject to the release of opponent Yulia Timoshenko.
\"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction,\" S&P explained, fearing \"commercial restrictions\" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents the quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that in the event of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green light for Publicis-Omnicom fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus nearing the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger actually brings the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
\"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the period of review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, as provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended - both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the approval decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
The merger is also conditional on the obtaining of other regulatory authorities and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups - they add.
The Congolese army hunts down the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels of the M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 is on the verge of being beaten after being chased from the northeastern localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
\"We're going to pursue the M23 and run it wherever it hides because it's a criminal,\" Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesperson, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they martyr the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, a political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reverses would not alter his demands for peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Cruisings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last village in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of M23 came to be seen in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the North Kivu province, benefiting from the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of staffing, strengthening its mandate and forming a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC Staff has been redesigned and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, causing a change in the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be reaching its end,” predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government was able to fight a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accused Rwanda, who flatly denied it, of military support for the M23, which had been formed from former Congolese mutineers.
British diplomat William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to demonstrate his restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of the shells that fell into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagaana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
\"We lived with M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to be a day liberated by the army,\" testified one of the residents of this bordering town in Uganda.
\"We lived in terror (of the M23), we were traumatized,\" he added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It states that - both cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date -
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of having been reached, after having returned from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already caused about fifty deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in withdrawal from the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, one year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with an increase of 25% of the expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net downward profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transportation: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been requiring, since the beginning of the school year, a fee of $150 per student (up to $300 per family) for students receiving two-home school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
“There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested,” said Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
“It is always better to talk about it, to get together and to find solutions,” says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closing of the emergency rooms of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the strike of a number of months ago by some of the staff and several unions, including CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to “decline the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not take place on 4 November”
An official request - not to risk emergency management in Paris at the beginning of the winter - but also to not interfere with the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although the PPHP prefers to use the term \"transformation\" or \"change in continuity\"
As of 4 November, firefighters who were about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency tickets at the Hotel-Dieu will all have received to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency-specialized interns will leave room Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current of the month.
\"The Hospital-Dieu emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th - the president of the medical institution commission (CME), Loïc Capron, who supports the management project.
\"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firemen, only people coming by their own means,\" confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-Dieu.
\"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency,\" he stormed, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
\"Things are being made progressively,\" answers Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for the ARS, who, on November 4, \"there will be no change in terms of service rendered\"
\"The minister lied to us or was lied to,\" laments the urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as Head of SMUR early July for leading the strike against the reorganisation project, he defines himself as an \"alert launcher\" in the face of a -cynic decision - taken by -the medical-administrative technology -
\"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that have been renovated less than five years ago,\" he said.
For him, if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem -
But they are regularly fattened.
There are, for example, nine hours waiting for Lariboisière's emergencies.
In the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients (dispatched) on several sites are not likely to represent an \"avalanche\" in other emergency services, whose human resources will have been further strengthened.
In both ARS and APHP, the \"new hospital model\" has been under way since 7 October and is expected to continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also be involved in the establishment of an \"ambulatory care permanently\"
\"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnosing,\" asks Gerald Kierzek, who -the concept of emergency is not serious - is \"dangerous\" and marks a \"medical regression\"
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change armsets, warn Christophe Prudhomme, urgent physician and CGT Health member.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, counsellor of the UMP of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, makes it clear that even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if they returned to responsibilities -
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled on Monday morning about France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would make a clear disagreement, stressing Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable plan to postpone it to the other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama instructed the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says one US official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take back its hand in the NSA's hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, a U.S. Administration official replied: “The United States does not conduct electronic monitoring of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington”
Expressing itself under the seal of anonymity, the person responsible did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another officer indicated that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the broadcasts at the ONU headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday the strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the conservation of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, prior to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began early in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to \"overstep national interests.\"
\"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),\" he added.
These SDGs will build on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and become an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
The security concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as there are conflicts between powerful personalities.
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founding president of Mozambique, towing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
\"We want peace to come back; we want stability,\" said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment society.
Worried about the future of her country, she traded her work clothes against a tee-shirt bearing the mention \"we want security\" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the site of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangings since the peace agreement that was signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by the Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became a party to opposition.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million of investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brasil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the root of recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for the outbreak of conflict, and the prosecution of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP Wednesday, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a \"loser\" who wanted to use \"all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.\"
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
\"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,\" said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have not been able to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
\"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop fighting,\" said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate properly and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to receive a greater number of votes.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
\"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,\" said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to \"warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,\" said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the government's frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
\"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is the latter to find solutions to problems,\" he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
\"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,\" he added.
Children should be taught myths and legends as \"lifestyle models,\" says the author.
Thor's legend could show that \" Brutal force does not weigh against subtle rust,\" while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be \"too violent, too scandalous and in some cases, too obscene to be taught at school,\" Crossley-Holland recommended a \"very thorough selection\" of age-appropriate works.
\"I find it great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,\" he said.
I have been pleading for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “ completely stop”, the messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: \"You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.\"
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimed; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known basis of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from the Hamas army branch was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot shells from an Israeli armoury.
NSA espionage: the United States is - too far away - admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone - too far - in terms of espionage, recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington's first widely controversial opinion with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
\"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this is no longer happening in the future,\" said John Kerry at a conference in London that he was participating in since Washington on Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his speech retransmitted, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since defused many attempts, thanks to interception of communications and the collection of information.
\"We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be up to date on top of these projects,\" argued the American diplomacy boss.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, -I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been cheated -
But we strive to gather information.
\"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate manner - it has still admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured the President Obama on Thursday night that he was \"solved to try to clarify and that he was re-evaluating these practices so that no one felt cheated\"
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program named “MUSCULAR” and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January only - ranging from metadata to e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These intercepts would have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has widely intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
In the face of the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve military operations - in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States, and that would not be the case for Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage that has also generated China's empire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the club of Ligue 1 in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship in Monaco with different goals, broadcast the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without being the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply indicates that it is \"bleeded\" without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from a left knee inflammation when he returned to the selection in early months.
A Ceremony in Memory of Crematized Dead Ones
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his institution, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for Paris City Hall, must attend, and then explain, at a press conference his proposals on funeral matters.
To follow the ceremony, click on it.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a close one, this is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on \"violence\" which constitutes cremation, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, \"a violence done to the beloved body\" which will be \"reduced to a lot of ashes\" in very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would accompany the phases of mourning.
There is also a “symbolic” violence, which is due to the “effacement of singularity and distinctive signs”, reduced to “anonymous” ash.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poor in France?
\"Because cremation is a new fact,\" answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of thanatology and author of the book Apprivating Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to approve it.
Approvering the cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funerary Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would have been entitled with an burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Since then, 73% of those who have chosen cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the reinstatement of ashes,” said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now propose masters of ceremonies, who, in the presence of the body, proceed to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, naming the deceased, linking him to others, referring to him, giving meaning to his death, organizing farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted in line, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the rat relogment turns to the controversy
Early in the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Lands Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, the relocating of the couple and its three children into a new T4.
However, the family refuses - for financial reasons - and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The deratisation company performs two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every demand of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, there have been 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left behind, and the rats do not drive in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratisation products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a child is not going to be killed.
\"We didn't invite rats to our home,\" said the father who left his home to settle in.
We are soon without the money and expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has suffered from the fall of the dollar in the face of the yen, which is detrimental to export values and to the warning of its annual outcome launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony has fallen from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than thirty firefighters were sent to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Quebec Seminary's court.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firemen arrived, which were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the smoke coming.
\"Then the alarms happened, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it was buildings glued here,\" said France Loiselle, spokesperson for Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was most recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
\"Most of the poster heads emerged in Carolines, and had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,\" Hirsch said.
We created this festival to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of \"Stand Up for Heroes\", a comedy and music evening for the veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has taken on scale, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival went through non-traditional circuits, such as shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (\"The League\" on the theme of the cheerfully lasciful fantasy football of the FXX chain) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the \"Saturday Night Live\" show and was part of the \" Parks and Recreation\" series, but she is better known for her series of viral videos \" Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a single voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors for this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but became a accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he launched a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, in downtown Manhattan.
\"The city is definitely in comic DNA from all of Larry's work,\" Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would come down a street between two buildings and say well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil prices continue to decline and close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the Chinese Gourmand manufacturing sector in electricity is strengthening.
The U.S. Reference Gross Price for Delivery in December decreased from 14 cents to 96.24$ the barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow after growth has rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The right to abortion in Texas is brought into question
A federal court of appeal restored certain restrictions on the right of voluntary pregnancy interruption that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and seriously questioning the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The judgement of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a \"admission permit\" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, under his or her hospital-care status, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical facility to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Proponents of the IPG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of the State clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this \"admission permit\" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had held that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional on the eve of the entry into force of the law.
But the General Attorney of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who fights the governor's position, asked the court to cancel the trial of the first instance that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star succeeded in a strong return on the side of the audience, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the why André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first prize.
Like every year, the first hearing shows win a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some of them found their own account.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make fun of it.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's monitoring and search program and dismissed the case.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the Shira Scheindlin Judge's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was issued.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be deterred from the case because it violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the highest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many defenders of civil rights.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 checks that mainly concerned black men and Hispanics.
In 2004, a judicial action was introduced by four men, all of whom came from minorities, and became a collective action.
Supporters who advocate changes in the NYPD monitoring and search program say that they will end unfair practices, enable more effective and trusted police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been severely reduced in the past decade.
The judge emphasized that it did not end control and search practices, which were constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
The tenants must vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the housing price that goes into taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 million to $5 million in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chief cook of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the Elysian cuisines as committed after working in embassies, the cook took all levels until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by passing by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an invaluable number of great in this world in a quasi-anonymous one that he broke only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years of age.
The man with the open face, skull and glasses of intellect, born on October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
\"I have passed from one castle to the other!\" ironized Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has appointed, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
\"It is always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus,\" he recalls.
\"Ms Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen - to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It is not wrong for heads of state who were showing relative indifference to land food, - they are all gourmands - it kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had a slightly more developed appetite.
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, - someone who likes to eat - and - there's not much he doesn't like -
The current Head of State, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, does not have a request for a specific regime -
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners in the Elysée: it is necessary to serve between 200 and 250 people in about an hour -
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the cuisines of the Elysée, who took a drink on Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart - Francis Hollande came to greet me -
He said praises.
\"They're the human side that came out,\" he said.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been on his side for seventeen years at Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-room building, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire service.
The fire went ahead, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, explained that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a large challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built closely.
The burning house was home to four houses, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of the investigation, but the killers have deviated from the thesis of a criminal act.
Wall Street Wolf: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some pictures of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will untie you in his role as a deranged trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a \"courtier in Long Island Stock Exchange, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a large corruption case at Wall Street -
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up an arnach that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decease and excess in any kind are the masters words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It looks like the film lasts at 2h45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate fairly in the oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used \"phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation\" to try to confirm a drum pipe on a link involving the then acting Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his \"beautiful special advisor\".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and \"plant permanently in front of her door,\" but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
\"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in the house of people hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love to present history to people to see what they are saying,\" said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say \"Of course if\".
Rumors on a liaison involving Clarke were first taken over by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that he had been told, \"Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles.\"
A band, on which voice messages hacked on its phone were recorded at least three times, was entered at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures of the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister placed in a \"Projects\" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, \"I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles.\"
Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a liaison with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defence Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not conspire with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The American President was due to receive Friday, November 1, 2013, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to the figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violences have become increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki for months.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the level of violence causes fear of a new clutch while neighbouring Syria is in danger of civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are killed in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this scourge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of bombings, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was committed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunniite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a \"world war\" against Al-Qaeda.
Violence is at the centre of interviews in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki that will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a \"third world war\" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased aid to Iraq in the area of security is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his \"sectarian and authoritarian policy\"
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship -
Beijing accuses an oighour group of the attack of Tiananmen
China's head of interior security accused a group of Xinjiang Uighour separatists Friday of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, darkened on the crowd that stood on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the murder repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkmenistan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighours, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur in China, driven by independent claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng said to the Hong Kong Phoenix TV channel.
\"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan,\" he added, his words being repeated by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of oighurous origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun to conduct a major survey around the world on how the parishes manage sensitive records such as contraception, divorce and couples formed of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties.
The survey was sent to each of the bishops' national conferences in mid-October, with the consent of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the United States Catholic Bishops' Conference confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, or a few hundred combatants, were re-emerged almost 2000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagaana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
\"That has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night,\" said one inhabitant of Jomba to AFP, joined by phone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was injured by bullet in the morning.
\"The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat,\" he added, \"it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have somewhat rejected the rebels\"
According to this witness who wanted to remain anonymous, the soldiers had \"past night\" in Jomba before going up to the front for a \"resuscitation\" operation.
We understood very clearly behind him the crepitations fed by light weapons.
From Bunagaana, a political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion that fell Wednesday, a journalist from the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered - in a final phase - the FARDCs which have encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them -
Since the resumption of Friday, clashes between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the army, Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but has provided government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were riding in the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, post-border with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians carried a multiple rocket spear mounted on a nine-wheeling truck of the FARDC, to ensure the rise of another gear plunging the positions of M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels to \" voluntarily demobilize\" themselves, without being disarmed - by force - but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without result for the time being.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
\"We have finished the talks, and there is nothing left to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature,\" said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without such information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012, of former rebels, essentially Tutsi, who were integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which refutes Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil is full of convened mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement to return to the DRC that had started in the morning turned around in the middle of the day.
\"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to get back together,\" said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on the back.
We have the impression that the shots are approaching the populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of the stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, singing and dancing productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a successful genre.
Longtime, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts were made in the ridiculous.
And successes like Cabaret or The Miserables wore the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes handle titles as successful tubes.
The first reprint, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of \"An American in Paris\"
In Mogador, \"La Belle et la Bête\" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as -1789 - - the lovers of Bastille - and the small musical comedies such as -Disco - or -Life and Times - are becoming the epitome of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book \"History of musical comedies\" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard to conquer.
How do French musical plays evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the \"musical spectacles\" that evolve to the advantage of producers...
Some use beautiful projection of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old bond back on the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in front of the poster.
Afterwards, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us revive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as - Rent - - The Bayer of Spidered Woman - or - The Spring Awakening - have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical comedy, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talent is as important as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the forefront of a musical performance is the assurance of a passion of these girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The mayonnaise was set up in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury to an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
An accident on the road caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 a.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring has been closed to the traffic until 9 a.m. where the accident occurred, the time for the road to be cleared and an expert to determine the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause much jam because the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was severely injured as a result of an accident over an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"
She was shut down until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Assault
Children play on a carbon shield that belonged to the M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana in eastern DRC.
The aim is to clear the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagaana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overshadows Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from her own.
There will be only the hills of Runyonyi.
\"Chanzu's is not very strategic,\" said the Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last place strong of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, have been cut off to almost 2,000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagaana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a person who had reported close fighting all Thursday all day said that the situation had been \"quiet since this morning\"
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the night before and were buried.
One girl was injured by a bullet, and three other people were injured, one of whom was severely injured, escaped by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no account of the loss of human life.
The NSA's revelations increase the paranoia of companies with respect to state surveillance
By a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate de Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. frontpost, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of American Intelligence Services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to \"flight the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.\"
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a whistleblower, he has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether the director should be believed to be speaking.
Reports that the National Security Agency of the United States has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised corporate paranoia with respect to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that blew up the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are likely also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
\"Germany must wake up,\" said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capacity and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
\"It's not the right way to do it,\" says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that so far thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have realized that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after revelations on the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says, \"Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?\"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
\"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion,\" says Kurt Bock, Director General of the BASF Chemicals Company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long marked the message that it is for the least unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional lounge or to leave a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, states that the collection of mobile phones prior to council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on travel abroad due to the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
\"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,\" says BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having committed acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company estimated that when it comes to economic espionage, \"the French are the worst\".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: \"The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.\"
The parents of a Georgian teenager, who died under unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of her high school, think that their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdesta to Georgia, was found on January 11 in a tapestry standing behind the steps of the gymnasium of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family challenged these findings.
\"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,\" said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
\"They think it defies any logic, the laws of physics and the common sense,\" added Crump.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
\"They sent their son to school with a sign and they were delivered to them in a mortuary bag,\" he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
\"I believe there is sufficient basis\" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from \"positional asphyxiation\".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, Moore said.
“Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements of a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the Sheriff's Office of Lowdes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to deliver all video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined on Wednesday.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that the video images contained clues as to the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, since the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One out of 20 children in the United States are now suffering from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock - the most commonly used EpiPen self-injector - in order to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily than the epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, \"I have the impression that something stings my tongue,\" \"I feel like I have a head on the tongue\" or \"I have a pickle on the tongue.\"
The NSA case underlines the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is being publicized by calling on the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
I believe that there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral stance, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues worldwide, we consider that, in the face of American power, this is an important illumination.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no case to be unworthy of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we look out for American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States for 10 years, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have in particular put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France, for example, can be used to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, as well as the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of violations of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk ? a degradation of their image?
We liked to expose them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk experienced by Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have spread.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies, in the light of the revelations, have to entrust their confidential data to U.S. law-enforcement providers, and therefore to the NSA.
Last element: The vast movement of revelations undertaken by media around the world, which helps to initiate a debate on the practices of intelligence monitoring until then almost no longer exists, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Intersex parents can choose \"indeterminate sex\"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of newborns will no longer be attributed rigidly to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to register an \"unspecified\" or \"unspecified\" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of parents who could make early decisions regarding a sexual re-assignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, \"I am neither a man nor a woman.\"
I'll stay the patchwork the doctors have created, contusioned and bald.
It is estimated that one child out of 2,000 children each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term designating people with chromosomes or atypical (ovary or testicular) gonads or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is not always well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, and then wait for and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and specialist in sexual identification issues, said that the new German law \"seems to be a good idea.\"
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
\"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but it is not the case of most children,\" he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how the identity develops.
Science about how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgenders in the area of employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and the crimes caused by prejudice.
Young boys of a non-compliant nature now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or \"third sex\" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as \"neutral\" after winning his appeal trial, which allowed him to keep a \"unspecified\" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from that land-based Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from the school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that \"since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed.\"
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
\"The parent role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex,\" she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered the genus to be a slate, which can be erased and which can be redesigned.
But now, many are the ones who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual re-assignment when he or she grows up.
\"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,\" Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He stated the term \"sexual identity\" and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut out during a mock circumcision to have him castrated completely, also removing the testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
\"Money presented this as a successful case of transition, but that was not the case,\" Drescher said.
At about the age of 15, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors \"always repeat this model\".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say \"they are not satisfied with the result.\"
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a \"satisfying life\" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation from the external organ and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
\"I knew I wasn't a girl,\" he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DSD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he returned a man, following a treatment to testosterone and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fears that the German law \"calls for labelling and stigmatization\".
\"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their children an \"indeterminate\" sex,\" she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only move forward assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that its organization supported Australian law because \"it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex name\".
\"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind,\" she added.
German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will \"responsible\" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz' daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called a syndrome of complete insensitivity to androgens.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and in-house in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or foster mothers.
\"The law leaves parents some latitude so that they don't have to make haste decisions,\" Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a deadline before registering \"male\" or \"female\".
So, it's all right - you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
\"This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is right,\" she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable - and it is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judges that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the coalition in power at the approaching vote of the Senate to decide Silvio Berlusconi on his mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left-center leader said he intended to continue to rule with his coalition until the forthcoming 2015 legislative elections.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, with more opponents than supporters, pronounces his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd, his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions that already wished to have the cabinet dropped.
L.A. Times reports that an agent from the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the firefight.
Firemen called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call that referred to \"multiple wounded\"
“The law enforcement officers are on the spot,” says the airport on his Twitter account, while the images of the televisions showed people evacuated to ambulances.
\"There was a gunfire,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told the AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person evacuated to a branch, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 at the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that terminals 2 and 3 are in the process of being evacuated.
The spokesperson for the TSA was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Members in Gaza-descend
Israeli tanks fired a Hamas Islamist Palestinian militant on Thursday and severely injured another one in the south of the Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
One source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your shooting of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army has simply referred to a \"targeted action\" in the area near a tunnel called a \"terrorist\" by the Hebrew State, crossed at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be Biden's drop for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama considered, in the greatest secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 Mark Halperin and John Heilemann campaign, \"Double Down: Game Change 2012\".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and reported on Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out \"in-depth group and survey work late 2011\" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama with his re-election while his hopes diminished.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and House-Blanche officials, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the Vice-President's replacement by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been horribly kept within the Chicago campaign QG and inside the oval office.
Only half a dozen close councillors from the president - including Daley, Obama's former head of campaign Jim Messina and former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the change was under study.
\"Double Down\" indicates that Daley carried the load to replace Biden, despite their \"close personal ties\", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that he had Clinton on the presidential list \"did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success.\"
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
\"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them,\" Daley said to the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, \"Lord, what can we do?\"
While Daley qualified the \"concerted\" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper de CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would benefit from the poll.
\" Campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action,\" Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if her boss was aware of the possible renewal.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president \"had been aware\" of any change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was \"possible\" that Obama knew.
Martin added that \"Double Down\" did not respond definitively to the question of whether political polls had arrived at the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that Biden's avoidance from the presidential list was being examined.
\"Maybe,\" answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to smell when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it leaks, the more brilliant it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company \"Lick Me I'm Delicious\", said: \"It's something incredible but we're still in the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200.\"
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the lightness of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation announced even more ambitious.
He added, \"I really want to develop an invisible ice.\"
It's inherently impossible because of the cooling caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper East Hampton Star, and destined for the residents of Springs city, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
\"He died on Sunday morning, while looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands of a musician sliting the air,\" says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
\"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of living he had,\" she added.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and disguise us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more lazy.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy, and I certainly won't do it anymore this year.
But the states show that I'm the gallant sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million on candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises should represent 1.2 Md$ of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most wanted disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't granulate.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go to the candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we're not going to tell any stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion maize grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't yet come to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as \"Terror Behind the Walls\" (which is in fact a real prison), \"Howl-O-Screen\" and \"The House of Shock\".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you pissing on you that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the \"beautiful head\" style.
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped bowl is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the \"baby-witness\" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and did not have to sit inside.

Royal Bank of Scotland will create in-house a default structure -bad bank - comprising 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and to accelerate its rebound.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said that it would enter a provision to depreciate additional doubtful claims from four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the \"bad bank\" would allow a feature to be drawn from the past, with the government in particular being accused of engaging in the management of RBS.
\"We can now move forward, we are concerned about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the United Kingdom,\" said the new Director-General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has six-point harness seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
These options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said, \"The rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed.\"
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare for raids and raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle - the championship will really be palpitating.\"
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North and Middle East Africa.
Firemen were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck at 15 m above the ground on a unstable cuckold in a career
Ruby, a cocker scarecrow, escaped after a gravity-free road accident.
She was found three days later by a person who walked her dog stuck in the career
The firemen came down to recall along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape at the worst after the firemen were called to retrieve it safely while it was because it was 15 m above the ground on the unstable skirt of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker, escaped after a road crash Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a Wednesday career.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and her 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately searched for their lost dog and launched an appeal on social media sites after she disappeared in the career due to a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m., a sharp-looking person who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the career, cornered 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firehouse has been on the scene and has come down as a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal circus to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical Aid Specialist Andy Clayton said, \"She was in a precarious situation.\"
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue - she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
Technical Aid Specialist Peter Lau said, \" Ruby was very lucky to get away with it.\"
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; its general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, \"I was terrified by watching relief.\"
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was amazing to have her back in her arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were spooky.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Alderson of Keighley added: \"We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move.\"
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was a chorister about Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, \"He dredged me when I was 18.
She added, \"It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.\"
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he \"has categorically denied any advances to Katy Perry.\"
The representative added, \"Maybe she confuses him with someone else.\"
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, \"Prism\", landed at the top of the chart this week.
Beijing called into question an Islamic Turkmen movement
\"The support in the wake of the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia,\" said the boss of Chinese security agencies on a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighours of the same family of the dominant Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several countries of Central Asia, rushed their car loaded with gasoline drums against the entry of the Forbidden City to Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 wounded.
The car driver, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which declares itself to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The burst of Europe gives Scotland the choice
Another day, another worrying history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the big titles (and it was expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States devote much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scottish.
So it's a story that's not one of them.
And a story so ancient that it is now set: I first heard the bobard that \"independence means passport control\" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's jog against Brussels's, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or militating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency win the ground.
Even in Germany, the alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections in September and emerged the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal-Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carcan weighing on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has not much to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits - it was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has made its members aware of the exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters - what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper imbalance in productivity in Europe.
Following the \"green\" energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason for subsidizing French and German energy companies to consumer costs - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-rehabilitatory disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt, particularly in France, is one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU to be a means to control Germany and to set Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to slow down.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, with socialists being sent to power in the third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party reminding it that it cannot start from the principle that a right-wing split will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European anti-money block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-Money feeling in Europe will unify and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will be more like \"the Europe of the Nations (substances)\" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make the United States look soft.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to march Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement, provided that we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is - and it is worth noting - the anti-austerity political movement that was the most successful in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Exquire, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Ageing earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not also pronounced among boys.
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair begin to grow at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
\"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - generally this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,\" Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier among girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 three-quarters in 1970.
\"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,\" said Kaplowitz, also the author of \"Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem\".
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered \"premature\" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows or stops - this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster developments may justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first rules and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and a small size at adulthood.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs but acknowledges that \"controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and feeling for girls to be different from others.\"
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
\"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues,\" Kaplowitz said.
\"It was a shock,\" recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came back from the school frightened and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6-9 who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate conditions, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the tendency towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and infants.
\"We need to be cautious about how we identify the real appearance of puberty,\" said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a Pedo-Indocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
\"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,\" said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
\"Inside Llewyn Davis - brothers Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the village of 1961 Greenwich and folk music that just started to resonate before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film has just undergone a retrospective at the French Cinémathèque, had revived the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Peter trio, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their gift on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the star-planetary pop Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich allures in \"Gatsby the beautiful\" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the interest debited to the machine gun when she speaks.
\"Inside Llewyn Davis\" tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't beat and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts the foot replacements raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
A documentary air
\"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of rudeness, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a carrist but an integrity keeper, with self-destructive behavior,\" said Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the day like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become the epicenter of the development of folk music that would produce international stars - as reported by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes as a documentary, from the 33T invendus embedded dusty music label inhabited by an old, impatient secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers were produced.
The magic of the brothers Coen still works by integrating a funny character who goes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a scary look, lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled that he, in Tennessee, was “large in blues and country”
\"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,\" he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the job is necessary to -- to be considered good -- chance can also start someone's career -- and more and more today --
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, pop star explains that in a career, the most important thing is not to get stuck in everything that can stop us from expressing ourselves.
Gérard de Villiers, the author of \"SAS,\" is dead.
He would never have known my retirement.
Phenomena of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, \"The Revengeance of the Kremlin\"
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as the author of spy novels that knew too much about it.
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198s and 199s in the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a wanderer.
And before Afghanistan, he also went back to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of \"SAS in Istanbul\" the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Of course, between 120 million and 150 million all countries were confused,” he said, “he was moving forward last March.
His chat Burmese on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building of Foch Avenue two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
\"Without counting pirate editions,\" he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between bronzes or the reported ivorys of the 130 lands arpendated to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the picture of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a gun or a assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, disembarked Austrian aristocrat and contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches to the pits of all the evils of the land, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
\"I never meant to be a literary author,\" said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a teller who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked — like the great front-war reporters of the Albert London type, who went on-site and came back with real and long investigations —
The father of SAS said to make a kind of geopolitical sheet -
\"I am permanently in my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I left\" added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet with journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SAS are often pre-monitoring: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command centre killing several senior officials, he had told the story in the \"The Way of Damascus\"
In \"The Fous de Benghazi\" he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the CIA in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980 he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in \"The plot of Cairo - a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in \"Panic in Bamako\" he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I'm not a believer, I was a champion of Gérard de Villiers, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips into often disturbed areas, he settled for a month behind his machine writing marguerite IBM dating back to 1976 - all of which were changed -
300 pages later, he wrote the word \"FIN\" and corrected each page at the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly painted for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers rejected these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I count many readers.
Villiers's Gérard had said, \"Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old.\"
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes quarrel over the width of the seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages among the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, opening the way for bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show that takes place this month.
The conflict is about the width of the proposed seats on long-course flights to passengers in the economic class - which are not always the most brokered by airlines, but which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out while the aircraft were seeking to sell even larger versions of their bimotor long-course aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the plane - in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats - is essential for the economic performance of the \"mini-jumbo\" segment.
Boeing states that its re-assembled \"77X\" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 18-inch large seats in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai air show, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to realize what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled \"Would you accept that?\".
\"Boeing offers long-distance flights in tighter seats than in regional turbo-powered aircraft,\" said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but the seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the modern long-distance journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40-49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the US Department of Health.
The average American turn of size of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival adheres to a concept of seat dating from the 1950s, when the circumference of the freshly named \"jet set\" was narrower.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width level would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with respect to seat width and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
\"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities,\" said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute there is a flight order race for an estimated amount of at least 700 million dollars at market prices in the coming decades, enough to have the US and European exports balance examined.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat performance in their latest models of long-distance bikers 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
\"Boeing does this in order to be able to casserate more seats and make his planes more competitive by reporting to our products,\" said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus air carrier.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers stand in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
\"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the 777 threat,\" said the expert in Mary Kirby cabins, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who tour the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater personalization of the cabins by offering wider seats side-by-side on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other large modern equipment manufacturer, the experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry to set up a size standard for the seats would result, but that he could forget the sales wave of 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposed remuneration for the founder and director-general Larry Ellison, in the light of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but comes to dull the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just happy of his boat's victory at the American Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negative on his pay.
The Oracle employer renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but it received approximately $77 million related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
In the 2013 fiscal year as a whole, the net benefit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the 27.5% bonded stock exchange rate, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mice alive from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on the human being is started, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first signs were encouraging.
\"We really hope that this type of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today in the market, but finding that their addition is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,\" said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trap all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having its nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to whom nicotine was then given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated \"were calmed\", said the researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently so that the levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
\"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not take any pleasure in it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit,\" he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
The head of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, we learned from security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officers, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the North-Waziristan region.
\"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot,\" said a high security officer.
Earlier, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that discussions had taken place with Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripods refuse to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr.Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiry in August 2005, without any call for tenders.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which related to the Obeids approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented at ICAC showed calls that were made between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
\"The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease policy?\" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
\"No,\" said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, it wasn't like that.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says one in charge
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The manager didn't specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried air strikes against missile shipments to Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass an \"authenticity\" test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of establishing an \"authenticity\" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent visas 457 from being used for unskilled positions or as a means of diverting their family and friends from Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbours.
\"The failed statements on foreign returning at the end of the line - and - jobs for Australians first - are an unpleasant return to the time when trade unions called for a protected labour market,\" she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while others were under review.
If the \"authenticity\" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for \"if the job offer is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company\".
Businesses could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9 - year - old suffocated son of man went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baroness Minister Kramer stated that the project \"would bring the United Kingdom together\".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called himself \"excited\" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will take on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of travel to northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel time between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said, \"Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together.\"
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without him, we are facing a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: \"Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.\"
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support \"without error\" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: \"The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the global high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
\"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
\"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.\"
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States' efforts to relax electronic device regulations.
The Federal Aviation U.S. Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change of procedures so passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in \"aircraft\" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision that U.S. carriers are required to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was examining the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
\"Casa does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft,\" she said.
The issue is subject to regulations which oblige aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained permanently and passengers comply with the safety requirements of crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
\"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft,\" said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it was currently complying with the current rules.
\"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately,\" she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA's decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transmission programs and passenger controls.
\"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,\" FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances, and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was stirred on the side of Pia where a laugh involving several people broke out on the side of the Poste.
At least four minor injuries would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went on site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's cage lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga holds a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her girls' tuition fees in Singapore.
\"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,\" says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt increases - that ValueMax, where she made her transaction, became the third holding loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Putting jewelry in hold is not only a quick way to get cash - $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's cash lenders are receiving an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund-bender with a branch in the same trading centre.
However, cash lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit checks or evidence of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders in cages while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and low- and medium-income families turn to cash lenders to fill the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio of households/gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession.
Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
\"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the salary scale] seek to supplement their income as they can,\" says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to make an effort to retain their personal effects in order to achieve the cash value of their jewels.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items stored in the 200 state-owned loan stores are in gold.
People say, \"The price of gold is high, let's put the chain in gold of grandmother and we'll come back and look for it next month.\"
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest loan shop operator in the cage, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the cage loan sector that ValueMax, the shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it already has four shops - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its director general.
The company will finance them by using 60% of Singapore's 66 million dollars that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have resulted in criticisms of the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that the cash flow offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
\"Customers hypothesize goods they already own, and the fact that their personal property is monetized does not increase the debt of households,\" she says.
Funding is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to lenders in cages are not only those who have financial problems either.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gift Shops to store gold ingots or Rolex Watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of the company.
\"It may be healthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that have cash needs to go through a hard drive,\" says Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor dealing with young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, was deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court, Halifax, in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being hunted
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a bracelet with the cross gamed was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, indicated the store Friday.
\"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store,\" explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue her, but - as soon as she arrived, he had already left unscathed - she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good mouths.
\"You don't go out on the street like that unless you want to attract attention,\" said a client named Rosina Rusin, 60, in the Cambridge News newspaper.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to disguise yourself as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
\"I've been wearing a black armband SS twice a week since three years at Asda,\" said Paul Dutton, explaining \"mind problems\"
$ 325 million rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan is provided with strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking \"emergency\" measures to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
Funding, planned over four years, was decided after government consultations with the Independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
\"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the State,\" said Ms. Plibsek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to catch up on the delay.
Funding is also provided for clinics without meeting at Hobart and Launceston, for better external care, for the training of medical staff, mental health services and for the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
\"These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first-line clinicians, this is the best way to cure the health system in Tasmania,\" said Plibsek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much \"unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system.\"
However, he congratulated the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
\"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing the public health system from Tasmania from the blacklist,\" said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the spokesperson for the opposition on health, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is a \"beneficial solution\".
\"The reason we are here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,\" he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a government of the state that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretends it's a bad day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibsek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel takes place with a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France of the 1760s, she recounts the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the cruelty without the edge of one Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never goes into lubricating or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapon production capacity, states the surveillance agency
Syria destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIC) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November set by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or \"make unusable\" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is thought that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights based in Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120 296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, of whom 18,678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of the militants of Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a persistent civil war, within closed deadlines.
A statement by the OICC, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was \"now pleased to have controlled - and seen - all the declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling.\"
She added that \"no other inspection activity was planned for the time being.\"
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, \"abandoned and...the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.\"
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Sapira unit was one of the two sites that the OIC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OIC Executive Committee.
\"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,\" said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by punishment against one of Bali's bomb owners
Survivors and close to 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years of parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killings for the attacks on two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and resulted in many injuries.
He was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, known as \"Demolition Man\" for his reputation as a bomb expert, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
\"It should be dragged to the execution squad,\" Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew a back bag loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was \"dead\" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Passing 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounded hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former Al-Qaeda chief, Ousama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to re-establish links between Southeast Asian and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups.
\"He didn't go,\" Ms. Corteen said.
Until recently, he was making fun of the grief he could have caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
\"There will be a lot of tears this year,\" said Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal against his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not call their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk about their mobile phone - in accordance with the latest highly expected guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the storage of aircraft to be in conformity.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
\"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon,\" said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them before the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not land them until the aircraft has set up.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, FAA said.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiters, called herself happy about these changes.
\"Once the new policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with the carriers to do so - it will benefit everyone,\" Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like \"room overseers\" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to log on to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in plane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game to which Actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled at great noise from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And the heavier devices like laptops should always be rigged because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
\"Portable phones are a real problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the CCF, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,\" said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease the restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of the reports on the presence of interference with navigational and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of those days.
The new line planes depend much more on electrical systems than on previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have enabled their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to host Wi-Fi systems also withstand interference better.
The vast majority of line planes should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who put pressure on easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders charged a Kindle e-book liner plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for well-meaning arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
\"We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security,\" said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird elitisted from a North Sea platform has been released into nature
A bird, helibutized after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
We had the water stream set up on a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said, \"This river of water was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.\"
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: \"He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.\"
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the widest and most comprehensive survey with British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on those countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states stagnate.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than become part of the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arks.
When asked for advice on specific policy points - ranging from regulation of monopolies to laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has led to general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area - 40% of large, traditionally the most pro-European companies - are even in agreement.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a major majority wanted to see Britain continue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a \"significant change\" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high - achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow for a 16% vote to be taken in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a single moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain, and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses this means putting the emphasis on trade again and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween colours
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed colds to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the parties got caught.
In New York, thousands of people in custom took part in the parade held in the “Greenwich village” district

Halloween is a national celebration celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
\"A historic event took place today: The construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest-scale project in Europe,\" explained Alexei Miller, the Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, a country through which the bulk of Russian gas destined for Europe is transiting, increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated \"forever\".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
Pitcairn Island wishes to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily News of Tahiti, taking back an information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambian archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, with three other small islands close to it.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English navy which resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few tens of residents, most of the descendants of the Bounty mutiny, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
An island mayor's deputy went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Pitcairn's mayor, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would make it possible for the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, a neighbour of Pitcairn.
The FAA is undermining restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft - but calls on mobile phones will still be prohibited.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin Province, northeast China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit over 19 million pot-of-win yuan, reporting the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, assisted companies and officials in obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be also unbreakable with the powerful - tigers - and with the - flys - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, including former Petrochina oil giant managers.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions within the state.
But the government did not demonstrate any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it \"had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.\"
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr.Hare told Gail Furness, counsel with the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by stressing, \"external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization.\"
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management had been a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were obliged to report any violation of the children's security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on 12 boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, had them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was headed by Lord and had applied for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she was responsible for YMCA Caringbah's children's services, Jacqui Barnat, which included Lord \"very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time\".
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had blurred their judgment, causing them not to report their actions.
Mr.Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the Council of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson from \"the Jonathan Lord incident\" should not concern \"the signaling\" by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff shortly after the allegations were raised was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an \"excess of zeal\" and that it had been misused.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, declared the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were \"serious problems\" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair stated that he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man made his views known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's position, Mr. Blair would have replied, according to the London Standard Evening: \"Yes, of course, but it may be possible that this happens, so...\"
When many experts on equestrian events met in Cardiff to confront and win the Cheval's trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the little one and his Shetland Toffee pony have trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable - which are of the same size - were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap somewhat on the side casually to make his 2-year-old Pony Toffee parade around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his unusual natural qualities of dressing for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has trained since with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, \"Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo.\"
They came up against and against all, but the two sparkled the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were mad that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, \"there was electricity in the air, and everyone encouraged and applauded it.\"
He walked the entire length of the track and even though it seemed to be small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad at animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
In the way he started, he'll probably soon be participating in the Festival of the Year's Horse - and I'm sure he'll make a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: \"Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to run his pony.\"
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and the way they walked on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was so proud.
A Chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal \"will be renewed\"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redesigned, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen immediately admitted to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a \"complete overhaul,\" said the regulator.
The order of \"renewal\" emanates from Guangdon's administration for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wronged articles on the company named Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
\"New Express was disorganized,\" said the regulator in a statement.
He said he had decided \"to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.\"
He also \"commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete re-engineering of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible at New Express and immediately re-engineer the journal's management team.\"
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
\"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,\" he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his excuses on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several major suspects recently made television confessions.
The experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in -unavailability -
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on radar.
The flight of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear chauffeurs of Charles de Gaulle, in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was - without danger to the marines - but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the unavailability of the ship until mid-November the time to take the necessary corrective measures on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a naval defence specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, deployed to the Var for the occasion, are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier.
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the defective heating.
“Everything is being implemented so that Charles de Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that it does not call into question the ship's programme of activity - nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had appeared from Toulon in mid-October for a workout.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young fighter pilots.
A small failure - circumscribed to the storage space of the reactor, then occurred on the amiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent from the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax flood, all kinds of permits cost, administrative costs not to end.
In short, endless siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars could be spent in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money seized by force to taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no concern about the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of boxing ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or be demolished.
It is also interesting to note the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not the public level to invest in such enterprises, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes in the Fisheries and the Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (great water consumption) and the large decline in population, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention waste, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation about its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by tie-ups with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer is making it worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzant on an equivalent length to nearly six long football pitches, connected to warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area is full of endless warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were discovered by passing unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to judicial records.
Three men, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced for 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that departed from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who had taken refuge at the Ambassador of Ecuador in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a 40-year-old Australian Notice of Remission, asking her to report to a police station, adding that if she did not do so, she would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ambassador of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard \"issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice,\" said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How biometry will invade our lives
Finish typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier , Deputy Director General of Morpho , believes even the century will be biometric .
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about this.
Only in 2011 and France, the National Commission on Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of hand or the venous network of hands in companies, administrations, canteens...
\"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime - Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will rely on new techniques, which will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
\"For example, some people who work concrete have very low fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,\" notes Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand, involves a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data at their disposal - and a drawback: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
\"Today, we are conducting research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a silent environment,\" says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
\"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data - confirms Sophie Vokiet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person from another) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the one she claims to be).
The identification was so far concerned the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all the citizens already numbered.
This makes it possible to ensure that someone does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance to a hotel or store.
\"We are collecting images of surveillance cameras and comparing them to the photos of celebrities that are freely circulating on the Internet,\" says Dany Nassif, in charge of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who tails in a store, follow its progression thanks to facial recognition and calculate waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
\"A biometric pointer avoids the match that points for another\" justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and placing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the stamp of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with large distribution banks and presses: when paying in store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
Experimentation is planned for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash 30 seconds less, it’s good,” explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer custom options.
And, finally, ensure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
-The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it - names Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy specialists, they, continue to worry.
“The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance - Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada predicts.
A driving driver at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs has been inflicted an almond of 1,000 £
A motorist was charged a fine of £1,000 for rolling at 210 km/h with a hot drink set in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay a fee of £90 and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign landowners to blow up the bubble of London
The Treasury provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold property in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea arrondissements, and represents £708 million over the fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said, \"As a result of the increase in stamping rights on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-absorbing law in this area, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.\"
\"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners reluctant to sell,\" he added.
The prestigious real estate - 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market - in the prosperous sector located south-west of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% in the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year growth in the year 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a \"internal market\" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) in recovery, according to Savillas studies.
Scientists have just highlighted the way a dog's tail movements are related to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs moved their tail further to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: \"Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.\"
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as well as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films that included other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: \"We presented to dogs films where other dogs were included - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor - and we were able to trafic the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or to the right.\"
When the animals saw a dog without expression move the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deflecting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: \"If you meet several times with other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.\"
Researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinarians and tenants to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: \"The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail moved to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study.\"
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
\"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified - and dogs are no exception,\" he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviours can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngite was diagnosed with its singer.
The Sheffield group was due Friday in The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his Laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to defer a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: \"Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and after requesting a medical notice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1. \"
\"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to occur in concert.\"
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on November 21st.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose him, so François will name his first group of men who will eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of a pope - this is therefore a group of 120 \"chosen cardinals\".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
\"Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the Consistory of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,\" said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Voix catholics stated that by February, the number of elective cardinals will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of elective cardinals reached 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted to be over 80 years old.
The consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis' election in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and Italy in particular.
\"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,\" he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope had decided on his own.
\"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him,\" Valero explained.
He added that it was \"very possible\" that François sought advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities in the rank of cardinal, but that François was \"full of surprises - therefore we do not know who he will name\".
GM reminds some of its new U.S. pickups to repair the seat case
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually tilted files, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the tilt mechanism level.
As a result, records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
\"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,\" according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups started in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed default pickup owners during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day stop of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 Silverado pickups and 16 503 Sierra pickups.
The GM stock course rose by 1.4% to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the arrondissement of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been in this place for some time.
A Mitoyan foundation wall had just been erected over the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving by car and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a hairdressing company.
Resuscitation maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his severe injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was sent to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts played out by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called \"The Audacity to Win,\" and it's the memoirs of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I slept, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends wept for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, it had 82% of favorable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the \"neither seen nor known\" and the assassination of Ossama ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm at the brink of political despair.
The republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor can it explain the accusations of whistleblowers who reveal the harms of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence are the \"most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon\".
And more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, as the political opposition party and events that happen by chance, like Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
However, while the favorable opinion index has plunged under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flowed.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses in favor of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Mayors.
At an after-campagne meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
\"I want us to focus on our talent,\" he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr. President, and I am no longer in agreement with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The motoard, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining extraction magnate, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out issues of potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be eliminated.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were prepared to personally benefit from these policies.
\"There will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not he gets a leave,\" said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recommencement.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a re-engineering of the suffrag scraping system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
\"We need a better system,\" he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered options for electronic voting and has recently issued a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and would take on his new \"very serious\" functions.
Public service is a public service issue.
\"We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time,\" he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of ball dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Thousands (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Are you surprised at the discovery of this new dolphin species?
That's good news, but I'm not surprised at that.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences among species.
Today, some of these classifications are being challenged because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two species very close to morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific dolphins and Atlantic whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, it was only present here.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we might have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of re-establishing from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the newly discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This branching of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
It is preferred to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it is a long time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global investigation of regulators on suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where US$ 5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the handling of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests from the regulators for information.
\"The ongoing investigation of this case continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and the other regulators,\" said one bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his post as European trading leader in the currency counter at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European foreign exchange trade manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working with Barclays and Citigroup, and added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said he was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - examine the allegations made about bankers that had been heard to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests from regulators for information, reported sources close to the file.
Banks have used instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines in the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader stated that, despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trade management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms \"explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost\".
The news came the same day that Crédit Suisse announced that he had sent a trader working in his London Stock Exchange office this week after causing a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
\"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was handled,\" said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation was framed, supported by a lawyer.
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation - as well as a stick-up -
Me Ruby said in La Presse Canadienne that the police had -- ignored or minimized -- the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and casual driver Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described it as \"inexplicable\" - the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on listening to his phone, claiming that the Chief Police Officer Bill Blair chose in knowledge of not acting against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as \"obvious and desperate attempt\" to stand up with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute \"reasonable motives\" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships falling in mid-term, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Fellowships are moving down on Friday in mid-term, plunged by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its policy of quantitative relief earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures are pressing for an opening of the rising U.S. shares after two consecutive respite sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest CAC 40 repletion, plunged by the result warning of his partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published down results this morning and announced the creation in-house of a failure structure -bad bank - comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%), on the other hand, remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that would like AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy goes well, as John Hardy, argues, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the reduction of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its reprisal against the US currency and struck in session a further two weeks to $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area's bond market instead.
Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the Health System Reform Act ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of the sick and affordable care) - which requires citizens to provide health insurance by 2014, without having to pay a fine - and stated that it was constitutional under the government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered due to the loss of all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates at the presidential election in law in the 2012 primary school, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to the veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Hanging between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday, 31 October 2013 at night, during a violent blockade at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1st, following an depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another commander of the Hamas Armed Branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and a armoured bulldozer raided some 100 metres inside the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four - heroes - and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
\"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant,\" threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for \"terrorist activities\"
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to combat Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the Tsahal forces (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
\"This mission was imperative due to the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also hit an air military base in the northwest of Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an \"Israeli strike\" but did not give details about the target.
\"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,\" he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing exclusive sources, which she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain indicated that the bombing was aimed at a cargo of ground-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of militants and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse his two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's ink and poems, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to ticks and from black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, end like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a Henry Michaux ink is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and the face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next picture appears, incarnates it, comes to light.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group to the unit (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of \"Gloire du morn\" where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front-stage.
It's the same principle, big PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up choking and numbing.
As is also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hair that get bored or these black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, imposed himself, with his ticks.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt's forms, open a broader and giocious imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hoisted by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the rally, are richer.
The stage is partly draped with grey, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a deserted house.
In the piano, dancers relax to play the partitions.
Their bad addresses in music, touching, give real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, treeling the red nose, in loving parades very polarized men-women.
Loves are carnassiers, fugitives or players.
The gestures, laughs and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that melt.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotinant, descend among the spectators, glorify, smoke, short-circuit, play applause codes, stretch the sauce into a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Northern Patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nordl patents has begun an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday, against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he co-finished on the post of sale at the patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Northl patents for 4.5 Md$, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent companies before the U.S. Court of Assis in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in connection with Internet search terms, indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is Google's core job.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufactures phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which gives fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Northern patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering 4.4 Md$.
After losing Northl patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 Md$, a market in part based on Motorola's patent library.
\"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate the said patents,\" the trial's conclusions were stated.
Rockstar claims the most important damages and interests against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious wounded Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, indicated Friday night the king's prosecutor's replacement.
The expert posted on site by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life expectancy of both victims is always committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's house and his companion, was beside him and was burned more slightly.
\"The two victims were intubated and extensively conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she in helicopter, he in ambulance,\" said the bourgmaster José Paulet, who came down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the rear wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were appointed by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Archery police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected President to lend an oath
Mohamed Morsi has lent the oath of investment, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a \"new Egypt\" when he lent the oath of an investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected and succeeding president to Hosni Mubarak who was cast out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the Upper Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took oaths before the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
\"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,\" said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
\"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,\" said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and hard-pressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclamate the new president and, starting from the presidential garb of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the uncharitable \"relief wheel\" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
\"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,\" said Mohamed Morsi, in blue costume and red tie, addressing the judges in the woodwork hall where he took oaths.
Later, Mr.Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while being kept in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song \"The People and the Armed, Hand in Hand...\", surrounded by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime in Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the former elected president, deposited it.
But by taking an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is of use, it bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The downturn in the USA has slowed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published Friday by the builders, five of the six major ones having achieved performances below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he felt that this slight blow was first explained by the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fortnight of the month -
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared with 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit among others from the success of its pick-up, saw its sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM's action won 1.4% at 4:35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.
Renault plunged into Bourse by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday of the biggest drop in SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced having dropped its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, reporting traders.
Nissan, who had to undertake such a revision, also announced a renewal of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by the \"warning\"
\"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning,\" said a trader of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and Japanese builder 15% of French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: Two dead in a gunfight near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely injured Friday night by shootings fired by two people on a motorcycle passing by a place of the neo-Nazi Golden Aube in the western suburb of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Aube had argued that the victims were guardians of their premises.
The injured person was hospitalized at the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service rushed on the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the area.
The incident took place a few weeks after the prosecution of six Golden Aube MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in a criminal organization, as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Driven against Barça for hitting Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said \"very disappointed\" that his call was entirely justified.
Almost 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to the violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15 042 subscribers immersed in the black, the Montérégie with 13 464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large area of Montreal is also known for its lot of panels with nearly 7,000 private homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think the travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net profit forecast at the rise and expects record results from the vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million reached in 2011/12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of profits in the first semester and that the second semester had begun in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
\"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and many of them are in a good position to achieve record results over the whole fiscal year before deduction of interest and taxes,\" he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which is generally the most profitable countries.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second semester, making it possible to compensate for a low domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first semester where seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns pull on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unacquainted strangers opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making victims, as a result of a apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The assailants fled, specified the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, Police General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt is almost no longer receiving any tourists since the army has dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed the demonstrations of his supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present \"new texts\" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to spend an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate English literature qualification.
The Ministry of Education must publish tomorrow its new English and math programs - the first subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes to other fundamentals next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a \"wide consensus as to the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,\" insisting that the GCSEs would be \"more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.\"
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, the Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and the students in Singapore are about 138 hours old.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of deep maths - as well as the greater emphasis on materials in international classifications - would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of courses.
The programme will focus more on \"real world problems\", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and seriously questioning the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at the Halloween Muy
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door calls for candy on Halloween night.
One of the shores of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
\"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Berlin-Mitte Jewish cemetery,\" he held a large print on his daily life, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, took place as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
\"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a command\" according to Mr. Tuchel.
He wore a general uniform.
\"In the left inner pocket, there were, among other things, his service statements with a picture,\" he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the city hall of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
Let one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormously tasteless.
\"The memory of the victims from the foot is vastly vast.\" He stepped into the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the \"final resolution\" and was, inter alia, under Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the \"logistics\" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend most of their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the election \"Heros CNN of the year\".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the consequences for the rest of his life.
\"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,\" said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr.Bwelle spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get any treatment he could get.
\"It's not easy,\" says Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock, ride to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 physician for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are in the private sector.
\"The only problem they have is poverty,\" Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 surgical acts for free last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they settle in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrains to go to villages that need the most help.
Chance doesn't follow them all the time.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross muddy rivers or slopes.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his big smile and energy overflowing - is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
\"We receive 500 people every visit,\" said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beets, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - a necessary document to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, a city hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the waking room to leave his place for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's a rising pace, but villagers' musicians usually help the team to stay motivated.
\"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,\" said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of her work.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge last year, and he knows that their presence can make a difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to care for a hernia would allow him to work again.
\"This will change my future and that of my family,\" said the man.
In addition to having this hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works in private medical offices around Yaoundé at night.
It is this second job, he explains, which funds 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
\"I don't know when he's sleeping,\" said Katie O'Malley, a second year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr.Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have at home.
\"We were able to participate in operations to help spray the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,\" said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
\"He's a hero, there's no doubt,\" said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to go out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he has made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
\"I am so happy when I do this work,\" said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and to relieve pain are the reasons why I want to do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, academics have long been able to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting its weak for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitre of other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallinard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the editor's hidden work and underground writing.
The heir to the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True yet, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and admiring of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the \"Memorial Sites\" to which he attached his name also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a lively eye-catching, but incurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora are soon two years old and have already established that the one who passed to not write had many and well written.
The book here should give him final justice.
However, once again, we find the temptation of ubiquitousness, intellectual wandering, jubilation made to jump like joint feet from one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the bronchor to one and the same passion: to discover the constituent node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of the time.
Recently, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders, French identity was an timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, forced jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and underpriests, authorized interpreters.
The one who plots Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not stand as an heir to an eternal frank, he refuses to define it.
Concerned analyst of family strangeness, he erred in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
It includes the company, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so durablely situated in its borders, so tyrannical and solidly masonized, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure up the trouble born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that ends in two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchist, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; rather, it was concerned to regain its sacredness and all the more of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And hence an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of revolution.
To make this French identity unique, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, a declaration of rights, designed to establish a new society.
But the American cosinage only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about it.
Here, men buried with an Old Indigenous Regime, and even more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confited it.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and which have been interwoven in the rest.
There is an institutional consistency, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as well as errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
France leaving, France coming
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could recapture the ripped robe of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
To this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the pupils everything that in ancient France obscured modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity had only a while.
This is again in debate, led by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of responsive minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the exquisite surrounding of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We found out the chimney was a housewife.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The liner stood in the centre of the center.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject about the idea of a nation, but had withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, confided to us, as grano jumps, that he would end up doing it.
Certain in a less stiff, brighter and more subtle form.
But we are not mistaken, as binding.
Because much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis speaks of the internal need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: \"The return is quite complex to manage\"
He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his team from “Antenna 2” who came to film a demonstration in Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retracted since 2008, he has been involved in the creation of the Association for the Defense of Hostages - Hostages of the World - which he has been presiding over for several years in 2004.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to take back the course of their lives.
\"The New Observer\" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex-grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association \"Otages du monde\"
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h stage of \"Antenna 2\"
What are your memories of your release today?
On the spot, especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tender.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive on the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
French take us to the Embassy of France.
This is the time of the first strokes to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having had a t-shirt at the embassy in France.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there in helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival take place on French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible bulge.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I come back and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane staircase, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin leads.
The bikers take the crap to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do some police to stop some of them from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole, and we're out of the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
The very night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins a sort of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How did medical examinations and DGSE debriefing take place?
I had the right to first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and encounter with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of the Niger?
I'm listening to what he says.
The debate on ransom issues in particular.
Some things piss me off, some less.
I'm trying to share things between my past issues as hostage and my head of the World's Otage Association, which allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
Hostages of hostage-taking - political - - most of the time - must be qualified and hostages should be allowed to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why don't you say to hostage takers - you've screwed up the rules of war, like those of all the conventions in Geneva, we're going to bring you to justice -?
Yet it seems to me to be founded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The ghastly anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the first democratically elected President of the country.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Until now no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a joke.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial of a pro-Morsi, and he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, and 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel reproaches 9 U.S. States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, all military spouses have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with - the Minister in New York recalled in an address before the Anti-Defamation League against Anti-Semitism.
\"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses at National Guard facilities, located in their territory, have denounced them as violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-State swindle began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the deployments of the Texane National Guard, as a result of a conflict between the Texane Act and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population involved in the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard on Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are on-site on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualifying phases will begin in the laundry, at 10 a.m., before the scheduled finish at 3 p.m. and the award at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young hyeroistic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything as long as he goes back to competitors who exceed it by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Ask Him About a Drug Problem · Global Voices
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media outlets.
A video given to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to consume crack, while acknowledging that he has a cannabis comb.
On Thursday, he took out several journalists who asked him about his property.

A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin, while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The Rage Diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
\"An epidemiological investigation was undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have contacted this kitten between 8 October and 28 October,\" says the ministries of health and agriculture.
-Five people who had been in contact with the kitten have already been identified - and have received preventive treatment.
In humans, the preventive treatment of the human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before symptoms appear, is very effective - the statement is accurate.
Departments now call people who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucus or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
Since 2001, France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free, according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded case of rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE) -
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
\"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated on time - reminding departments and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama’s health system reform is making its way back
Under a flood of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that \"if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.\"
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of withdrawal from their claimants, the Republicans criticized the president over the last few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
\"The vast majority of people with appropriate health insurance can keep it,\" he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls \"a current efffervescent\" about the withdrawals, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek a new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better suited health systems for the same price, even for less expensive than expected.
\"You'll win,\" he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 per cent of the population who are themselves insured were forced to change the regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
\"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,\" Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony before the Washington Committee on Energy and Trade.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed \"unfortunately\".
\"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,\" she added.
I'm looking forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who expressed this sentence, while believing her micro-cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly's meeting yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to find out whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why the \"architector\" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which is now worth millions of Americans.
Vettel comes out a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 World Champion, squeezed for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday a special helmet with a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose among 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, its stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
An Aubervilliers' inhabitant launches his Party of the suburbs
We're not mistaken, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoue, its founder, the \"Parti de la banlieue\" - does not only address the banlieusers.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies you.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday in the press conference in its native town of Aubervilliers, from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot melting that characterizes most of the neighborhoods.
My proposal 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoue, 50 years old, territorial attaché, today claims to be a-100% apolitical - even if it has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevennement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my program are tied to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
There's only one extremist party I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoue has built its program -advisable on the Internet - from many themes that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of real estate guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene - For the 2014 municipal elections, this could be fair, he recognizes -
It's a matter of time and money.
The Banlieu Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already ensures that there are seven listed heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
\"And the support e-mails that I have received since yesterday do not all emanate from suburbs - he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that the American espionage \"had gone too far inappropriately\"
John Kerry pointed out that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs was slowed down by admitting, on several occasions, that the espionage \"had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.\"
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on \"automatic pilot\" when a series of incendiary revelations by denociator Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities came up.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: \"It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on 11 September.\"
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage had exceeded the posts, but insisted that the rights of everyone had not been violated.
He said, \"In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate manner.\"
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: \"We live in a new world where people are ready to get drunk.\"
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to have them explode, and to attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did well to prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency was being monitored.
\"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay at our side in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism,\" said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the US Senate's European Subcommission, during an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which damaged relations with some allies in the United States, but the Agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and those from 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip from Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show \"feeling firmness\".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have applied themselves for years.
\"We can change our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make espionage,\" said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plunged by Shell's bad results and the day after an announcement by the Maintenance Fed in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
Australians appeal to their prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled him, had attacked him early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all pieces.
She was held in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on Phuket's outskirts rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was \"extremely concerned\" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
\"We obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,\" Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for trial and was released after the payment of a security of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, it was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an upsurge in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder at Phuket in Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to re-worship its distorted image with tourists, which could lead to a acquittal.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came otherwise than with the RSCA cars

Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
“The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from an old border post of Rekem to the PSG stage,” the spokesperson sent.
The course will be the same for the return.
\"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures were taken to carry out arrests or even guards in sight,\" said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on a horse in various cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of \"Living together in French\"
The Vision diversity organization has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
\"So we create projects so that they identify themselves to all of this,\" explains Vision president diversity, Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute has identified several challenges for the school board.
\"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations we live in the student clientele,\" he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, in some cases, also come from the past.
Rachida Azduz from the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
\"Different educational strategies, that's the real need,\" she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
