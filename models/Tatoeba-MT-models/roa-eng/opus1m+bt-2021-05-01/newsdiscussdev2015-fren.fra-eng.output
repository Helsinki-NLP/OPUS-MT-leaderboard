I feel like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the press that says it's common in rugby is big anything...
Finally, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break the nose of anyone during the games to drink (unless it is part of the game), but we have actually painted in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed to me quite typical.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go much further than misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol that is often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke at most.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damage and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, former private boys.
From very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are the \"misogynes jokes\" acceptable?
It looks like my university's rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races through campus, theft, damage of property and misogyny were all part of the game.
Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
Thus, this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:) is also ancient.
@lux You have not read the article well: a small half of the water of your pastis is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well, we can still consider that the fleet of pastis has on average easily over 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already that
A sacred foot of nose to the catastropheists and reheaters of every hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too : What evidence is there that the warming stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and the irony, what do you have as a sign?
So you don't understand much about environmental issues.
It is not a question for \"catastrophists\" as you say to be concerned about the disappearance of the oceans but rather of the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the fresh water that accounts for less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species but above all the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you cited and whose generous effort you make to quote the source, there is little of course doubt about the truthfulness of the conclusion.
Regarding the problems of fresh water, I assure you the French are far from being affected xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogme without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimated at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, not thank you.
\"Then you have to stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly.\"Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to say that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of greenhouse in an exponential manner.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 good men would come to the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever that might be?
Probably not me!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is his version of a direct action.
We're moving backwards, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot out of the village?
The latest revelations that the vegetation consumed 16% CO2 more than any climate model allowed give priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flat.
Did you see the Green Army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is just a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is flawed and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a hoax, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to marginal electorates.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
Silverhead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
It is clear that this member of Parliament is in danger.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from departing from the rules of the 17th century.
However, punishing him and not Thévenud is incomprehensible for not bad in the world, even if the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady is doing a whole business isn't in her honor, it seems especially like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had put to fine all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that in the debate on the feminization of names, the \"Académie\" was offended: \"Let's say the Keeper or the Keeper of the Seals\" (a position that had never been occupied by a woman up to that point).
Pure machismo!
- The political arena - ...!
The sand basin, the back-court of the Republic replete,the marigot of the gourds of operatte, the table of illusions ,etc ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good-bye, bad luck.
Qd the Phallocrate Humpist sits on the label and the parliamentary regulation by waving the + basic civility under the false umbrella of the good manners, the sanction applies to him -as quality - for his partisan intent and his overuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's doing the provocation to get him to talk about.
So far he was unknown, now he may be proud to be known as any primary-class cancre is known.
The Academy on its back and we can see that Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to tackle its internal problems and stop causing couchs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when they tell her what she doesn't say.
This Member of Parliament behaves as a collegial in the midst of a crisis of adolescence, which is causing provocation and whose peers will, in the delegation, see the Principal in order to cancel the hours of collescence.
and defending him on the basis of a text they didn't even read!
Women do not even account for 15% of the signatories of this UMP member forum.
Mr. Judge, I call on two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, otters, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it brings them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are passionate for the majority of our 80 years to work, move and shop.
What a strange phase we have achieved - we are able to multiply by two our lifespan, but we pass the majority in the boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that it is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try it again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, communication necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I'd like to play - basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to be searched, etc.
It's not hard and there's no anthropomorphism - although I agree with the idea that you hear a lot of crap on animals that are \"playing\" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game is not just \"useful\" (it may be, or may not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that \"there is a playing principle at the basis of any physical reality.\"
\"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her\" Perhaps yes, hope makes him live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to respond today to an article when you should drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite excited about those who seem mad at first.
But when you see what many have learned from their education at school, especially among the public most likely to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the least beginning of anchoring.
\"the public most likely to engage in assaults on women\" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily correspond to your thinking patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disembarked youth too!
If the reactions were no longer reacting, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Pen and Sarko in the first place.
I didn't learn anything about it at school and I've never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Do I have to love myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values...
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you can't read?
And are young socialists going to the suburb schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing montages on Twitter, but it would have to come out of beautiful neighborhoods...
It's a terrible campaign.
They're null everywhere but to give moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article isn't working.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double sense word game with the word \"naan\" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of an old 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less we have in the plate?
Because the quality of the experiment does not necessarily measure to the weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more dishes.
Of course, this is not the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child's portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they've made the effort to put them on.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good food?
Is the Manif for All is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a sort of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern child manufacturing systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery farm?
That's where you get out of here.
And if you challenge any technical intervention in \"fabrication\" you have to call for the ban on LDCs for heterosexual couples, it would have merit of coherence.
I'm surprised, moreover, that the so-called \"for all\" manif has not yet this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is correct that these are not the only cathos that manifest: the other religions as well, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these different churches have all been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup was violently protesting the gvt's will to admit the girls to school on behalf of the family's defence.
We're still in the same pattern.
More recently, the same currents have screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school has become mixed.
That is to say credit can be given to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be catho to know about the goodsization of the wombs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have as much right to love as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this also applies to the heteros in search of GPA.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of crazy stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has set, I'm not going to talk about the other things it brings, especially to Manutd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa didn't bring or bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why it won it was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommend 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney at this moment so you can be forgiven to do so as well.
That said it is good to consider that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero scored 56 goals and took 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and took 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In fact, \"Wazza\" is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism about Rooney's abilities comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be regularly selected in the team of your country for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's footballer qualities (even as an attacker) to Peter Crouch's?
You're doing this without joking?
There are really people in the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his career as a team of England.
Instead, he played the first retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written it by joking.
In a country where the gun port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those in this school just don't agree with the U.S. arms port authorization!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop kidding: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fancy guns at this age in our home?
Is this in fact powerful murderers for that matter?
Even though the weapon port is in the American constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that the rich children are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and reason kept svp.
It's an unarmed process!
Come on, you're in!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually owns, or does not possess at all, premixes to the taste of the morbidity.
Can we start from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the mabouls in this school than the students!
Let the parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
All right.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is much the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most reprisal state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
Those gleaming blues that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring to the start of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a wheeled collar sweater.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything seems so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
The opponent, perhaps?
But what does it look depressing?
You've preceded me.
I would have thought a thin knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou does these days.
Perhaps by saying \"to ostracize,\" he meant \"to alienate.\"
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing doesn't always make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could advance that their intention was to ostracize it.
But not here.
Looks like it's been fixed - weird. Maybe the whole sentence's been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was \"to ostracize,\" which absolutely did not mean anything.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still dropped by about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices fall in all states.
The U.S. economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthening itself.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes \"sustainable\" ?
In order to live there at this time, I will say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequalities become insane.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of funding electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe, but Americans have an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be UK to save the world.
Yet one of these articles simply forgets the essential.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and ticket boards couldn't give the change yet...
On the basis of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poorest, a very large majority of the citizens, will \"trinquate\" or rather die.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that his cynical and deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad makes him lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mousse, it is played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour - shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed \"to push the nose of the right into diversity\"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in safe seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that causes this manivel to return, the pendulum has been pushed very far since the end of the war, and I imagine it will now leave in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe Labour Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in denial knows that.
Of course, the Tories saw much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word \"Victorio\" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word \"defeated\", it wins the battle!
I agree Jack, it's a win, but she's thin.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia from hard.
On the other hand, I wonder whether the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general it is necessary to see the Earth more \"paste\" or malleable than one imagines.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand Wylie tells us about a \" quite simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth crust, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which gives/gives a) a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the \"fault\" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be located (more or less).
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for climate warming, it seems prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcanism have an effect on our environment?
Is there any effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Is it not likely that it will no longer warm up?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we see less of it.
Hello, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, especially in the \"active\" Mountain Chains where on the highly gloated mainland parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordially CB
Too often it is not known that the Earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to rise or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, in a delay, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
What makes the slip of the tectonic plates, like the tides, more or less easy by this moving bag, especially since the polar coves are relieved by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the equilibrium of the land to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am pleased with this \"human\", calling himself the Supreme of Nature and his self-proclaimed commander, ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created it and which he has so separated that it has become harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this in order to remain the supreme commander of this nature which surpasses him in the organization of his very viscera, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking himself with collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to look at him.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man from Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
It reminds me of a completely great series of 2002 around which was called \"Ape-man\".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, almost no one remembers it now.
Too bad you've never been past the first impression.
Your loss...
\"The ice creams, our distant ancestors\" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary \"History of Humanity\" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh, here I can't stand this guy, Brian \"air thousands\" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make a kiss in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self-conforming, in itself.
Of course, Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this approach.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of \"mass\"!!
Without making it an insurmountable horizon, there is no one related to the Cartesian approach to examine what we receive to believe, what we believe to be.
More than rebellion, doubt is fecund.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer and claim it.
His work on psychiatry produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid nobril, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that stands out: behaviorism.
Gauchet has absolutely reason on this point and to be anticonformist, it is to fight this degeneration.
Marcel Gauchet is criticized for being a defender of the order.
That's a great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, we ask some...
Blacks and revelry, to others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who look proud in their mirror.
In any case, thank his controversial contestants for putting under the current light Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persevering humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports the rise in the inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a black man on \"serious policy\" - he will be worth £100 once he has passed the weapon on the left.
Of course, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are those who will surely pay the least inheritance tax thanks to super paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
he'll be 100 pounds once he's passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
It will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Just like the rest of us, \"Dave\" will not die \"normally\".
Climate change and imminent collapse will end, he and the others of his end.
His “richness” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We all have to be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that the discipline didactic is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for some - inadequacies - natural.
Unreasonable statement for the teacher of math she was!
Like what...
Better recruiting and training teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no more than quantitative approach.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
Plus, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establish a relationship of defiance that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => there would be a need for training in skills to teach.
A job that you learn, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before it is a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not building car parts.
Pedagogy doesn't get even when you're a math teacher!
The \"sciences of education\" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation at bcp of those who embrace the profession.
If gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer discipline teaching) allows those who are less likely not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's regret the old Schooles Normales d'Instituteurs..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it's all right with his time job anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It's not right for me!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplaying and that allows us to listen to emissions on demand when we want it!
The internet, it's pretty incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB in my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a usb-like adaptor on the back of my SKY box, which is connected to the Internet, but listening to the radio on my TV made me feel so complicated.
Yeah, I think I made a mistake in the hours, and I had to hear Richard Lester about three hours ago.
Although it's men during the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its broadcast is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of Chris Evans' regular animators in the morning at Simon May's show in the evening at the return of the job, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-departed of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to be upset or to be thrown away.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have the same two parties that alternate with power and make the key players of the country less good than they have taken it.
The countryside is very poor, far poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes a mile to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't give a shit, they don't interest politicians...
But thank you for not talking about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, these are men's subs, sociology is very good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human foolishness, inculturation and ignorance so much that it still has enormous potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the NF thrives mainly on poverty, fear of daily life, fear of each other and the feeling of having no prospects.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save the honor.
They looked for him well.
To take the voters for c...
Here's what happens.
Who do they know?
\"Forgotten\" in fact there are fewer and fewer resources =>low allocations.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen to you can't just \"add and mix\", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as child care and socio-productive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money is talking, and if a sex isn't up to it, next!
The profits are mocking the life you're leading.
What are you doing, what's the benefit, and what do you have to offer?
The profits are mocked by the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women 20 to 45 years of age.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (the majority of which is done by women) must be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and to preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true \"economic emancipation\" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the Mskayadee point, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot of people who have to \"check a box.\"
The tiger is not Russian but Western propaganda.
Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger with the right to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-term exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yes, you do.
He immediately came to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext to arm some separatists to annex China.
If Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, a beautiful feline and a real danger of extinction finally turn into an article aimed at Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a leaf on the tiger of Siberia, but a leaf on the suites of a com' operation of Putin.
When exposed to the media, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The return of perpetual victimization of the Soviet-Potinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken full of it with her camel without screaming at the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, a saint protector of the great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case the tiger has understood everything, it stops...
Holland's going down, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seemed to be a horrible condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to repeat.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after that, it is a little empty sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there's no problem brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, the complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that's true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Labour and Revenue Department of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinness book of records where someone had tried to brush their teeth longer and the Guinese judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a rotten experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person with social benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not return information about when they brush or brush their teeth (easy results in the air by people who give their results based on perceived expectations).
Are there consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not on the genome, but on gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus graft impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a sort of graft.
There are probably consequences of this, but as long as we do not want to be born with an impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori problem?
It seems to me that this is beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not cause us to go any further, without asking ourselves the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limit and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have the, or the children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the street
But let the people, the women, the others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles alone, alone in your little pants alone.
of their \"conferencing\" this magic bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it sterilely in my safe if he could still give love.
The current biased circumstances make the FRYDMAN PR cautious about its communication, but if - if - we agreed to reflect, - we would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
Let's put it as an anti: cf here these men's reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodized.
I was registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not be able to judge in one sense or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women talking about it.
@Margane: In fact, this has nothing to do with anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that this implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it doesn't have anodin either, and it's done!
Please, don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially since there's no real competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The sportsman has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for Monday, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportsman before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all Real Madrid goals records this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet conscience...
I have a hard time believing it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the international oil investment company stage?
I was looking at it on a shit connection so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has been well defended and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the ground environment would not get out too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo in the whole becomes better.
A terrible penalty justly demanded but justly saved by Diego.
A scorching atmosphere mestalla and it shouldn't have been funny for the Atletico bus to be bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, \"On the Origins of Mamification\", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archeology 524 of September last.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and give what we guess intuitively.
It's not surprising that before making it complicated, we made it simple.
All science progresses in small steps.
And the \"organ\" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me a while ago that a black child's mummie had been discovered in current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, particularly geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummie was 1000 years old to the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She misses reading a little bit.
Maybe it's not contamination of modern times.
Did the desert at the time go any further than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing to the place where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough that a scholar of Europe affirms it, even without any evidence, to make it a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song doesn't tell us who the inventors of African inventions in Africa are.
If it is not and always \"of its poorly known ancestors\".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neo-liberal quacks of the free market which preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think that there are other people who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying about, so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of individuals.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good for nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?\"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allow millions in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that, yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis of power, until the courts intervened.
It's nothing but a right-wing manager in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far to his right and would find his place to the religious fools right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other right-hand European party to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is thinking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE patrons - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Fr.
Let's focus on the anti-intellectualism of the ambitious era.
A law professor at the College of France does not seem to be able to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel prize of economy and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, it is true that when Dr. Villerme noticed the work of 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were shot in sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah good old times...
Your reaction is equally fascinating because you are unaware of TPE's patron profession!
His job is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts on my youth salary newsletter, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example: much more could be cited, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which choke the small enterprise.
Your paper would have been very helpful if you had written it as an expert rather than as a Sorbon customer.
To order the neck to the archi-ressasé argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the grass, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts, and then that of the comments (the absence of the latter could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, we are referring to case law, among other things...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
Who is this complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (law, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are in the field of insufferable barriers to work and trade?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann \"Art has practically immunized itself against the criticism Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It's probably time for new revolutionary absurdities to turn critics away...
For every article about Ai Weiwei I’ve read recently, you’re one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on to something else!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced many good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologized, but it had to be exposed at all costs (without making a bad game of words).
It's the guy who bursts out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism trying to attract attention.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to hold an elective mandate to extremists from all sides (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which have served him several judicial convictions, are ashamed of both Israel and the city of Neuilly.
He does not represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, marginally.
WHO'S REMOVED IS COMMANDING
What does the Neuilly City Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who has been insulting a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls to attack this urbanist?
Apology of crime?
Can't I find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their furthest detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the \"Sionists\" (the term whose sense tends to disappear, because of his abuse), these two, like the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism \"that is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the womb of the beast my good lady would believe to have returned to Russia in the 19th century!\".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of a very grim nonsense.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the theory of the 11th September plot, we talk about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally faraway truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money supporting it, it is insufferable to the acceptance of this theory of detachment (as in the case of extreme religious).
It follows a logical and inevitable flight forward, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is a fill, but fills do not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You recommend that you be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a flow of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/Consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to respond.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow !!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like \"excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise,\" but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider it an attack - will you drink a drink and relax?
Better risk it than endangering my mental health by abstaining.
The government ends the fun when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is an amount more or less safe.
Maybe the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should conclude (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them thoroughly, like the smokers!
They do it already - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife's not here).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk today???
Sharks do not attract cancer - they eat anything but they are not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring topic for many years.
Refuse to run when you might run and reciprocally.
All right.
Whiting is Bernie's bene-yes.
Both of them, they destroyed the F1 on security grounds.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or less worst of Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely in agreement with you, but look at point 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit forums that refused to advance the departure to not miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly, +1
I just wish for a quick and quick recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that have failed to occur between decommissioning cranes and f1 were warnings without charge.
We knew one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How the race organization and the FIA were able to afford these maneuvers without getting out the safety because?
I can't accept that the risks of the job are raised or the fault is not at odds when we haven't prevented the foreseeable.
But this accident was.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not just mean \"ban over in the area\" but is for the first purpose of pointing out a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their foot.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more sticky after the turn and the driver, believing to arrive with enough margin, can get even at \"lower\" speed compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we cause in the void there, until we have seen the images, we will not be able to issue a fixed opinion.
I don't see much of what that changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happened, which made me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where we have to be on guard 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals that are injured like bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and the Toronto agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not derail as by spell and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains are very, very often on a day.
In addition, as waterways often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated places, because people always want to stay close to the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as this was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge reported on it last night, really shocking.
Have you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that has killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the railroad.
However, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
It may be that employees of the National Railway Society of Canada are expected to attend the next Calgary Hazardous Products Conference in Canada on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are trained in the transportation of hazardous products.
This article as many comments make the impasse on the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be any other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforce this fact, or what good is it to talk about the sex of angels?
\"God said, that's good - that's bad - it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
A leader's word (Muslim country but not of importance): \"But without religion, how do you want to keep the people\" .
In other words: obey the priest priest priest priest Rabbi imam and pray to you, it will be better!

Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way by trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its own cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather palot at this time ) or that of the free market ( passively supported by the state when it has to bloom ) ,etc .
Great ideas resulting from religious uprisings.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where rational emerges, the religious is tow and expresses himself in schism.
Religion is born as an ideological support of the State, and the gods put in the service of ambitions even though it has also worn forms of contestation.
The theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knows no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of the \"sacred texts\"
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are made explicit of the hatred of the disbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate (and fortunately the most numerous) religious who -- misread the texts and hold back only from humanism and values common to the whole of humanity, atheists and diverse believers.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and evil application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of \"merciful\" people, \"infidels,\" \"hypocrites,\" \"Jews,\" or \"Christians,\" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of legitimate defence.

An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take off your TV eyes for an instant, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, beginning with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.

Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass, victims of bombing by the army, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to go until explicitly designate separatists is in the western line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of pro-European neo-Nazi Gentiles facing bravely the wicked Russians

And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian woman, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the authorities in place who has not stopped denigrating the Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the \"Copative\", which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be re-raised, and which would whiten the money to its liking, mainly by selling players who were well under-estimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently he was misinformed by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without sentence,) and therefore took 3 and a half years of imprisonment.
The trial also took advantage of the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football-related offences.
George Becali also has a penalty for trying to bribe (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to sweat were our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were rereaded.
I still enjoy this moment.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption, Piturca, among other things, was involved, which signed as a witness a false document suggesting that the money confiscated by the police in Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this poor uneducated, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.

To conclude, I will add that the \"socialist\" patronism of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article from the chained duck?
It is learned that a unemployed person can remain without news for several months from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have led to the removal of people who for more than half no longer received unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how we can control people that we never see.
We wonder what a penalty is for a person who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for further derailment, we wonder what it will help recruitment.
\"It is learned that a unemployed person can remain without news for several months from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means\" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
It is not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should they be hunted out of the EU?
The EU was only of economic origin and should continue to do so.
The goal is not to be a \"police of thoughts\".
The EU is a pacifist project.
It has no economic significance.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality?
The Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt mafia referees who are UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this lucrative organization to rot and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
So what the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
Uefa should applaud them for messing with Blatter's comedy and his men.
This has been happening everywhere for a few years, and I don't overdo it.
Pulled out of the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to be twisted by small symmetrical phrases, just the story of entertaining the controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there are and there will be people who are busy throwing oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a \"Palestinian state\" that they are pro-Israeli and that it alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the Israeli armed Identitarian State occupying an oppressor colonizing
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian inhabitants of their Germanic people (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
That would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr, let us take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But, as for Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and its support for the questioning of truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaul was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli State is defined as that of a \"Jewish people\" whose non-Jewish persons will not be included.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jews, hence the contentious.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities we need to stop ignoring.
First, the Zionist European project (columning to own Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has missed biting from the start.
Their tender result will give them what the fingers bite.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small mouths.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite for the game.
So much sotiness is tolerated, including racial insults and physically harsh heels in football, but Suarez was punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the keys exist and yes, therefore, the players get hurt.
Getting his teeth back into an opponent's flesh for the benefit certainly does not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for a similar gesture.
Now is the third time Suarez does that.
If you bite someone at work.
What would the consequences be for you?
I knew someone was going to die.
If you're dyslexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two bullets.
I bet he was looking forward to playing with his teeth again.
All these word games about Suarez are losing them biting.
I almost bit the ham.
A prerequisite for a good school career is respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
It works if parents inculcate such respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by the teachers and the school of their children.
In good institutions, those who make progress in their students, parents are considered partners, not as partners.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together briefly) It is the parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to get to school.
Minging on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
The action will therefore be limited.
On the other hand, the school could do a lot.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be wrong for actors (professors, hierarchies and ministry) to play their role and not to be constantly involved.
We can dissolve a troupe that goes off to revive it, not the families.
How can we not talk about teaching?
It is true that communication courses allow for exchange.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's first role.
Transmit knowledge.
And if the parents' requirements are there, the school provides the instruction of their children.
What is the minister who dares to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect a smart comment from this beautiful suburb of the East?
It's a beautiful one, it's clear, but I think it's more like Willoughby, and so on the North coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Indeed a North Coast beaut!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would of course come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers Party.
It goes for a grinning, nowadays. :(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on hunger.
You would be rather grim if you wake up one morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and illegal life benefits will remain forever out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to submit a budget and then left.
At least he doesn't threaten to punch someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand aid from the state.
And as she can do lobbying, no fear of the outcome.
And so much for the job in France that it has nothing to do, it emanates from legumes always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially external ones...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time limit or an installation for marpol, no doubt the project would have come to an end.
After that, to know if it's right or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice to have the world look at it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton legumes.
Those who burn the tax and drought centres.
They want state aid.
That they didn't have it seems to me at least normal.
And well to the extent that an army ship under a metropolitan French flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized pavilion, yes it is normal to expect a kick of the state.
Or it is condemned to allow the British to monopolize the market.
It's the choice.
The eternal French problem that considers its sea façades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where people who are different from the average Parisian sometimes live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton pavilion with crews exclusively made up of pure breton strain.
With that, it's certain that they're going to have the costs down significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of \"hating everything that relates to the prog\", as they have just released an hour-and-a-half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career which would be \"closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s,\" I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he has had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to collect a bunch of half finished demos and call it an album of Pink Floyd.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
At curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and quite in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have not always seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have such an interesting story but lacks the popular appeal Genesis has.
Good points.
I would say, however, that the BBC has \"always\" hated the fact that it ADORATES progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest screams \"prejudice\": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
That's a beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an overwhelming success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his distorted understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the vision and reflection the fairest and wisest of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we had understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
We must have a well-disputed spirit of the common mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his distorted understanding of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, vindiction among the relatives of the innocent victim: a false understanding that will never prevail for those who wisely decide the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could also be argued that the death penalty often carried out wild violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who were very nice, who paid free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated by the disappearance of the one who was the bull, sometimes the torturer, to be loved and who hates their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you, Emilio, for this thought that I think is very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The one with the heart.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, we would think to read stories from another time, ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that span, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
Similarly for the two other \"Excellent American Romances\" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all over.
I thought I stopped you white, man.
What are you laughing at?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is incommensurably better than this painful Bellow, who received the prize.
Perhaps the judges of the Nobel Prize this year have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could as well have a racist [light].
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce \"genius novels\" as if it were a literary genre.
His name was Joseph on the other hand.
Who have you read about?
How many of DeLillo's books did the DeLillos read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like \"Human Moments in World War III\"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end up one day Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who pretends to live in the same world as I do and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a form of humour, \"the law\", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in Son only interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that we wonder what the term \"conflict\" has been doing there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of the danger.
After that we will understand that French employees are not dynamic and seek only tranquility.
The flood zones that become constructive from day to day the next day when a large construction program is going to start there, it is classic, and not only on a low coast.
Look at the flood plains near the rivers.
We were told that \"now there are no more flooding thanks to the checkpoints.\"
Now, you need to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, in the overall promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer here, the interest?
Get off the calculator and you'll dream about the life you could have been in place of Mrs Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute on Sea and former Chairman of the Urban Commission, which grants them permission to build!
The 2 breasts of the triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I am left-handed and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, not low political or low blows all azimuths, we are not in there in a fight of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are tough criminals.
The U.S. is a fucking hole.
So what the hell are you living in?
The U.S. isn't a fucking hole.
Yeah, U.S. cops are hardened by the rackets they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops \"come and fuck them because they're racists.\"
Here's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that there is a need for an incident like this to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's clearly you who don't pick up anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not osesive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension increases in this regard at the moment.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, hence Occupy's treatment there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naïvety of VA and others.
And where do you think the investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They are going to question those responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That Lmme's going to Elysée has nothing to wonder about.
Then, what counts is the recovery, the audit, the analysis.
And then we understand that the Sarkolastars have a concern to do.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a business-based antisarkozysme wave of all pieces (a non-place and no conviction) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 correctional referrals), two Dutch friends journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supports are indignated!
As far as I could read, VA's article only makes the rice grower grow.
I even laughed so much it was rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of reaching out because journalists are not - they are not - attached - to the secret of sources, are they not?
Unlike the fact that there seems to be no confusion between VA and power while there seems to be a misunderstanding between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the background and on its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal which in any other democracy would cause the government to fall involved.
Hence this editorial to the Abois, who says a long time about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I would have thought the pot would be fine with smoked herring! <*)))))
It is simply for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration issue was a second-generation Sikh who said she was at ease with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not fully co-operated, even refusing to give drinks simply because of the woman's religion, he also refused to go into his place of worship even though she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** \"who said she was NOT at ease\"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if he is a pub director:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more to the left, he'd be a communist.
According to you, what did the New Labour do that was particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS, this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (in their own terms to fit the nose of the right in them), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-allowed, the politically correct which kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is left centre and not communist, I said that to joke, which I mean they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them state-dependent.
That's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Drop your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I've asked you, these are specific examples of a Gauchist policy, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what the New Labour had done to him that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who now come to Great Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another cut, that of money.
We'll make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
Whether, renegotiations and if the word \"democracy\" still has a meaning in Europe, should it not?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider the unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail sector fully market.
At the end of the day, this means that the entire slopes of the French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
All sacrifices, including the advancement of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa, did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clear the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential in these days when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don't see very well what the competition of TERs could be!
Is there still a problem with alcohol?
If that is the case, shouldn't he certainly be a wolf chef?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to the end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense for me to start the process of separation between your life and the complications you inherited.
Looks like it's what they do, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones surface, have you considered a \"fleet plan\" so that you can cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a sympathetic real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He seems vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide support to help it resume work and pay for maintenance.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done a lot more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not hold his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their own good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuing father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong, if we let them see things by themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization will have disappeared, economic interests in the short term are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pole.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that makes in the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmental has a competitive advantage, and the others are forced to follow.
All policies are seeking is growth, Growth.
International coordination would be needed, but by then...
It is not the climateosceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in accommodations that it has had to build, those who buy industrial products that it has had to produce and transport.
It is not the climateosceptics that have shown against ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-sceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But nobody says that climateosceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental advocates also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on automobiles, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
\"I'll be back\" is in fact a famous McArtur promise made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good it may be humor to say that the expression is Terminator.
- greenhouse gases are a pollutant - There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what that is, but every good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what this is about.
Does anyone know what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo of the Guardian: How long before someone blames immigration?
I'm putting the fault on the crapper who took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the liars of the Democrats.
Or the Democrats' scammers.
Or the owners of Labour.
We don't care. They're the ones who're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump in a car or plane to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Sex with monkeys, is that better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't advise you to order antibiotics.
He hired Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse hired Ebola in Spain.
Damn it, indeed!
Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and your hat, which allow you to warm up, extinguish heat AND eat this sandwich in cheese).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not made explicit?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend some good time in space making galipets and round while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
TV reality has therefore nothing invented and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed up there to inflame the world and revive media coverage to the western royautities used to the motherhoods of tabloids.
They may have to come down to the ground and find out that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, men or women are not sent into space to make golipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful to mankind in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives have come from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can cite one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a cash drop.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (to write to the ceiling for example)
To pay for her treats?
To participate in the manufacture of an unprofitable product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything, and it even represents voidness.
Ah if the last one played high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make it possible.
You know, people who do what, including more and more private companies, especially to get the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think about buying plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to misdirect people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the \"sword\" in question instead of generic pictures of \"plastic swords\"?
Or even being curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) meant?
Typical bad report, we find that \"it's just a plastic sword\" and not the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Islam Shiite.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped arguing that plastic knives were harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small blankets you give in the fast-paced can get the flesh out of it.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule given to it by the author.
It is not worth trying to make a \"ha, ha, a plastic sword\", the facts as you stated them actually support his argument.
On occasion I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a \"cross\".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night long!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful developments, often technological, give the impression that many people have a right and need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a high cost (sales, electricity consumption) that weigh in budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Solidarity Energy Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the shelves of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But I never heard him speak.
Who can call it and how it works?
For information 60 million consumers, test water-saving showers and recommend the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 water saving per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then have redistributed in the form of actual revenue increases) so that these surpluses pay the increase in the expenditure you rank in the category \"compulsory expenditure\".
In other words, energy insecurity is \"just\" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it wants it to.
Note that the theory (neo-)classical of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no inherent limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to force the rate of economic growth, increasingly decade after decade.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows any physical transformation to take place.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is this allows to achieve the least economic (good or service) production.
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any increased pressure on energy (improperly called \"energy production\") even in the form of an increase in its price, forces in turn to increase production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not quite expensive).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not the \"production\" of cheap energy is to be increased.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the coming years and decades (the IAEA, in these reports, clearly indicates that the peak of conventional oil production was achieved in 2008, including inexpensive oil.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it equals things.
Take this to France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a webmaster of the Guardian?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yeah, nice work for the guys.
Although many English like to mock the Scots when they only lose, there is no point in saying, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they arrive to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if we play against them ;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because, now that the \"goldy shiige generation\" has withdrawn, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in departure XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been \"international-class,\" is David Beckham, a bit overdone, perhaps, but I think if he hit a potato on top of me, he would crush me completely.
People forget its athletic constitution, by the way, speaking of athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never mocking Scots.
I tend to be surprised to observe their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the night...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been \"international-class,\" is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is on that Juppe would have hurt to ask 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And he wouldn't get them if he asked them...
You mean people come here to make a good laugh?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his debts...
I ask myself, above all, the question of what can be said in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel prize, will think of asking for the slightest amount.
Content-based conferences are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget the reporting of these two figures is edifying.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all clear to me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like he's being blamed for making money?
I'm far from being one of his fans, but he's being blamed for having a bad (or fraudulently) run his OK campaign.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are taken care of by taxpayers.
Rule 1 of epidemiology: isolating itself.
All US and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
At what population infection density will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I'll take the plane to Spain, and then I'll take back a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is embroiled in West Africa, I can see that all flights and boats are prohibited in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods that says...
What a shame the panic of the international media about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It is such a sad journalistic article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all as relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from community to community, etc., etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all help better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get on with it, think about it and write, we're not just making noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbarous, its survival rate only by making a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a \"light of hope\" exceeds the understanding.
I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of \"validity\" to his view, but in this case it obviously does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was \"murrifying\" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let that appear?
For a territorial elite or other, the money does not count.
I read that the territorial public service is constantly increasing its workforce, and I have never seen article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate , indeed .
There will probably be lies and truths to us, to separate the good grain from the ivy.
The Court of Auditors costs a lot of money to tell so many economic slums.
It's true that they never had anything to manage Cambon Street people.
TCs are not in deficit and have funding needs that can only concern the investments they make.
The press, like the World, is using too vague concepts to play the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the overwork of public servants (to make good roundabouts for example) brings an increasing and incompressible burden (compulsory charge up to their deaths, since life-time work + retirement), these communities cut into investments.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of staff member, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also to hold the mayors financially accountable.
This is fabulous, the intercommunes would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the number of communal staff and it is the opposite, evidence that adding one level is not effective without removing the others.
How do you want to manage the big territories properly like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They would not prefer to remain imprisoned, worse swallowed, in the administrative canvas, it would appear!
Let's try even garrotate, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Veme has led with its providential men.
It really started with Petan.
Then he went on to get to the series - at the end of the breath - coming very much about.
Why won't they live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco over a movie theater to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind \"it's the fault of the whites.\"
\"Answers\" not \"answers\"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make it happen.
We now agree that modern Homo Sapiens has evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they have been able to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to hold the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
You're fired!

They abandoned London last season.

At least they're going to Los Angeles, huh?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outdoor travel for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the misfortune to be bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once our independence was restored.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did not favor us.
I love to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a United Coventry now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but that must be a good gypsy.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South East likely to follow them from afar or will they now have to support another team?
Beautiful pro-dome article and good extension.

I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry about those who're gonna lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It seems that they reason with Make more profits, and don't make healthier dishes and the best price ratio.
They're taking us for pimps.
Oh yes, be careful that people don't have too much fat.
And then we make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We'd do well to add some sodium glutamate as well.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the pasta are cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there is no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to business cooking.
Are there family restaurants and they offer tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal accident at work that went wrong.
A promising young man, trained as a thief, was following his father's career in prison for murder.
A man broke everything and brutally interrupted the vocation of birth.
That he is sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going?
Totally agreed!
What a mood!
The desire to discover it is obvious and difficult to excusable and blameable all at once...
Indeed, the desire for it is hardly excusable.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old kid.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again, but without asking forgiveness to his relatives of the kind he himself killed.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What have you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the conniving of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, knew exactly that the bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
That's what made it sound like!
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
It's been twice that I've done it, wine, landscape and food are great.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit it too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather important, German vine growers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations have experiences with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that needs to be recommended - Franconie, Palatinate rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
Wines are German-style (or maybe it's the opposite, very short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after meals.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer much, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle to property are so complex, the softness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a thermometer lobster the next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a superbly illustrated guide.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new dry of Baden that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are amazingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumlich that people drank when they were young (hee, I really don't think it's always true nivocator, except if I address myself to the more than 40 years - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grazi would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the deplorable state in which it is the Administration of France.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grandfather who studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be put to the vote of the House of Deputies: these barbitel cabinets, and those decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years old.
In addition, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real job, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For the elderly, it came time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets are on the way out, they will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrie, of course, but to think differently than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Since then, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire post-war model!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is best known in the public hospital.
If that symbol falls, we're really fucked.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals are not up to speed.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase the supply of public service in other hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a fault, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
The Hospitalization Day Price - a hospital management unit, is decided by the local Ministry of Hospitalization Regional Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course the baby is just one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia for a better job than the one he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to be taking two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all persecutions and abuse and war that run away from people in their countries and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during the civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this little superpower when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the ill-treatment that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils having links with the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that persons with LTTE links be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an upsurge of attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've had the coconut with so much periodicity.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
I didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So I wouldn't have been young year carefully.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses lasting his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless sume lab pay for the purge of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There was still little, we were told that Ebola kills so fast that an epidemic of great magnitude was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of persons brought back was zero.
Stranger the more we're reassured, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or three weak but not null.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the more a virus is deadly quickly (generally) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After that c is the general quarantine to save mankind. ..
Is there not something obscene to make mediatic advances of certain brave and virtuous Westerns, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African sick people who are not known about the trade, bravery, or virtues?
Of course this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of announcements is of terrifying partiality.
Freedom of expression, so beloved of conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking freedom of expression and the right to the privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative pennies would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A round of heat for when the problem will actually become out of control.
There aren't enough doctors already working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the \"war\" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Market Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just a black cashier for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is far smarter than we want to believe him.
He explains that the sale of Private Medibank is offset by the End-of-Term Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income population.
Maybe it's very clever, but it's not fair.
Finally, the \"minor rodent\" and Telstra's End-of-Term Market Fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to the next election in hell.
The most terrible for Nadine is still the \"old personality\", tasty....
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only she could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destiny for a political end of career: not to be recognized on the street.
Good morning She was not recognized in her town of Toul as adequate to administer it.
Like what good sense \"provincial\" has good!
We live in a hateful time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdote tells is sarkozy in a clean state: tiny poor ministers, confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonph on every impulse from the road to show that he is well-guarded in public order), grossness and outrage brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these \"old personalities\" who have become decommissioned to carry a firearm and badge would thus have had every pleasure in performing their self-proclaimed function of justice.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the page of Sarkozy, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
As a fool, for the blow
I don't agree, thanks to her we're laughing well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we'd have to invent it!
But it's easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this shot, N.
Morano obviously did in the mischief indeed, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curvatures and the \"Yes Madame, of course, immediately tell me in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman.\"
\"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets have abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians has become too important...\".
The Americans are not bad at all, but I still think that Isis is going to exceed them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses here now nobody does.
As for civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals the West War Machine.
I disagree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred the sanctions to the derailment of the \"war machine\".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconceivable in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - possibly a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may recall that the insurgents have not wasted any time to mark their main enemy when they saw it, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and harsh as this bombing is, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Good point, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with the recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument just to exaggerate statistics that are notoriously unreliable.
The only reliable figures of death related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let inspectors objectively find the facts.
It was of course in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in the under five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely biased towards this age group.
Of course you need to fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
It is necessary to stop acting as if people were pure spirits, that love was all the children needed, and that they could be done with unknowns that neither parent nor child will ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and contemptuous thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fancy arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or designed with gametes' gift.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the games you were released, you could, in my opinion, give yourself back because they would not have committed any crimes.
The latest advances of WFP (e.g. uterus graft) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire for children justifies these acrobaties and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just like point.
It's obvious that the GPA needs to be feared, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I've encountered with my wife.
But anyway, it is less serious than to be born very disabled or become disabled, to hire a serious disease, to lose all of his children in an accident etc.
Of all the concerns of life it is not the most serious.
This is a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consumable, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
Child desire is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her own will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
