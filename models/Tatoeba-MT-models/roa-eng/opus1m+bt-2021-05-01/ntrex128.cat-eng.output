Members of the Wales assembly concerned that they identify as Muppets -
Several members of the assembly expressed their dismay at the proposed modification of their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy arose at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly has stated that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP - fired with Twp or Pwp -
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the assembly of the Plaid Cymru Party commented that the whole of his party - he does not see it with good eyes - and has proposed several alternatives.
On the other hand, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was \"open\" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is too small a difference between the term \"MWP\" and \"Muppet\"
In this context, it should be said that the letter ‘w’ in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the Yorkshire English letter.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal deletion to introduce the name changes:-The final decision on any qualifier to call the members of the assembly will of course fall within their own members-
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the Assembly's name for the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee decanted itself by -Members of the Welsh parliament - or -WPM - the option of -MWP - was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to reach consensus can be an all-rounding for the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal deletion on changes in a matter of weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee's system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum for their country's name change
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for quite some time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the attempts of that country to become part of the EU and NATO.
President Macedoni, Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the change of name, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become members of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the Harlem churches
\"Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,\" says Mr. Adams.
\"Today, there's none left, both of them.\"
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have another way of socializing today,” she comments.
\"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically.\"
As far as the churches are concerned, they are concerned that the money they get from the sale of assets does not last as long as what their leaders expect - and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came from -
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
\"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,\" he says, \"and so what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all the churches, as it is entirely unlikely that most people moving to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.\"
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who directed a boycott of 125th Street retail merchants, one of Harlem's leading commercial streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of his at St. Martin's church, described all the prideful lane as the bells of poor people.
The expert who sounded the streetcar in July described it differently: \"A cultural treasure - and an irreplaceable historical instrument -
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also observed that it was the first rail in the world that was hit by a black-bred musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest lane in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What did happen in St. Martin's during the last few months, on the other hand, were the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese - intended to transmit the costs - to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent it.
Some of the parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wound a 13-year-old boy looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the August season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he took about half an hour busing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's screams asking for help, and then they rowed a group to the place where the boy was found to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming 'I've been bitten!'
They bit me!'
He had the whole clavicle ripped off - he watched Hammel when he got to the boy.
\"Because everyone came out of the water, I yelled, \"There's a shark in the water!\" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to serious condition.
You don't know what the shark species is responsible for the attack.
On a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I work for weeks that had detected a shark in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper zone of the torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product passages in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are just part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves about 28 billion GBP and continues to grow as the fashion and household products sectors fall behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test becomes successful.
Investment in beauty products is the product of the avidness of supermarkets to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for home televisions, microwaves and products.
Sainsbury's claims that he will duplicate his offer of beauty to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brand similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique make-up products so that most of the products are now fit for vegans, an increasingly demanded aspect for younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two shops in Sainsbury's. The first one did this last week in Croydon, south London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying on the Internet and changing into a habit of buying food in smaller amounts every day at small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos sales points to many of his supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to resell cheuvre sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the chain of supermarkets to relaunch their departments of beauty and pharmacy products resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's conducted a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended hastily by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of his 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will extend the range of luxury product brands for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: “We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product corridors in order to improve the environment in front of our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that we challenge the traditional way to make shopping -
Peter Jones (furious) after Holly Willoughby goes back from a deal of 11 million GBP
The Dragons' Star Den Peter Jones left \"furious\" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby turned back from a 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the whole business of household products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Pitrow's Goop brand.
The 37 - year - old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons star' Den Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative life-style branding joint business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was \"furious\" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new host's agreements, worth 1.5 million GBP, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Pitrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his Truly departure, Jones took a private plane towards one of his vacation homes outside the UK.
According to one source: \"Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be their long - term future and where we would see it for the next twenty - thirty years.
His decision to go back left all the parts involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at its Marlow plant ready to be sold --
According to experts, the departure of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of the important investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined him in occupying the president position last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together. In addition, Jones owns 40% of his shares in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program of the ITV.
A close source to Jones commented last night that \"We're not going to make any comments about their business\"
Hard accusations... - and then we fell in love -
He joked about the possible criticisms he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider - little of a president's own - and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump asserted, mocking the tone of a newscaster's voice:
- I haven't given up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho remarked on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a \"corresponding response\" by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by their country.
However, he observed, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
\"We're doing very well with North Korea,\" he said.
“We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we're maintaining this great relationship --
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: ending the trials with missiles, helping to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
\"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this fence full of people, we'd have about 200,\" Trump said, pointing out the crowd that was in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of the population in Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, pre-required to be able to catalyze international aid.
In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not call for international assistance, so that the situation is very demanding - Mrs Sumbung comments.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even for foreign people to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute to providing help.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still unfortunately unprepared for nature's anger.
Although in Aceh shelters have been built in the case of tsunami, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, although there was an effective warning, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous amount of islands in Indonesia is, in the best case, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was trapped in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as his central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the malicious infrastructure of Indonesia, and he invested huge amounts of money in roads and railroads.
However, Joko's government is facing next year's re-election of funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of fights in the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with torches, arches and arrows, and other blood weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the draw goal with a far jute in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The ball was accommodated to the left before leaving an incredible jute headed to the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation while propelling towards the right crossway of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent above a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
\"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create me as long as possible\" comments Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kanté coming, I did a touch and I didn't think about it very much, I just devoted myself to juggling.\"
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at break after scoring a goal in minute 25 through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's lead returned from cutting a pass to Mateo Kovacic before booting from almost the middle field and squeezing into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then he made a magnificent pass in depth, which left Hazard inside the area with the pilot under control.
Hazard overcame the defense to end the second pole with a jute with his left leg where he could not reach Liverpool Alisson Becker's porter.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League group phase next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths for the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a consequence of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the buildings collapsed due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, over 380,000 people, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after finding a stabbing woman.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street; then, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the residents of the area to see or hear something about the crime they are presenting to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement: \"Although the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious, to please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car's dashboard, who get in touch, as they might have vital information for the investigation --
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have informed him that no one has allowed him to enter or leave the building.
When she learned what had happened, she became speechless.
You're warning residents that hours will pass until they can come back in.
He could feel like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the weeping scene.
He keeps saying, \"It's terrible.\"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the area agreed with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the agreed area controlling the block of floors.
Any person is asked to have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and mention file 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around - rewriting the story -
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a \"bogery\" and an attempt to rewrite the story.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: \"In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main goals.
The iconoclastic English civil wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps it would end by sacrificing the Cromwell incorrect for the actions of his ancestor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than not now, as an advocate of parliament in front of external pressure, in its obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully accurate representation remains a historical issue of debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the 17th century made up the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated -
A murderous pig fatally wounded a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his last name (Yuan) was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pig court in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cows into pigs in a tent in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as it was known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from Yunnan's neighbouring province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him to a nearby pig court.
He said that in the court there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
\"My cousin had his legs broken and full of blood,\" said the cousin, of his last name, \"Wu,\" as mentioned in the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig was locked and isolated in order to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as \"desanding\"
They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
You just need to give them the respect they deserve - you commented.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all south-west of the US
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will carry torrential rains all over northern Mexico and south-west of the United States for the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the east direction to the west coast of the United States, and when the Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north direction to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave on Monday up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
There is the possibility that they will form rivers, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged from entering the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the throats to turn into uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring wind rats and dust clouds to specific points.
The depression approaching will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
Total rainfalls may be recorded above 50 mm, which could lead to lower residue flows and smooth paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive isolated tropical rain showers in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains escape to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will persist for all Wednesdays.
October will have several important temperature swings across the US as the Arctic cooled, although the Tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The central US region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with heat in much of the central and eastern area of the US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities for temperatures to be recorded above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness broadcasted to six different television stations.
Meanwhile, the political empire continued, with broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators saw this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average of spectators from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience figures were not available immediately by other strings that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, this is an audience similar to that of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders of which have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audience chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators throughout the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS achieved 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying that they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was incredulous by protesters when he was trying to climb up to an elevator to go to a hearing of the Committee on Judicial Matters.
Flake stayed several minutes with the view down while she was filmed live on television at CNN.
\"Here I am, in front of you,\" said a woman.
\"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?\"
They said 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it.'
Flake said her office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, she remarked that she would have more things to say in the Committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live the moment the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote whether or not it was going ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment to the plenary of the Senate to submit to the vote.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the next week's nomination, condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union to \"play politics\" with the future of the United Kingdom and to disregard national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former foreign minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU recapture each other taxes is — out of utter absurdity —

A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The ash spasted by the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was overseeing several recent outbreaks and tremors.
Images on social networks where a thin layer of ash is appreciated on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as \"Don Goyo\" has remained active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence were confronted with the riot police and thousands of people gathered at opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia about their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police began throwing eggs and paint into dust, causing the appearance of dark clouds of dust on the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, beatings took place with the police, who used their pores to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups were singing \"Don't forget, don't forgive\" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling \"Long life in Spain\"
Fourteen people had to be cared for by mild injuries suffered during protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independentism one year after October 1 was held a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation index was low, since the opponents to the secession boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering electoral colleges throughout the region, causing violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist protest along with his wife, said that he had no more hope of the possibility of Catalonia reaching independence.
- Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck - he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although on a low margin, in the autonomic elections last December, Catalan independent parties have suffered to keep the momentum this year, since many of their leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile waiting to be judged for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with his phone, and states that the conflict has plagued him by politicians on both sides.
“The tension just increases,” he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
\"Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backlog in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government,\" he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly invests against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was caused at the doors and in the same building.
It's also possible that, at some point, someone shot a bullet at the car.
A Menga play gives the victory to Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
Livingston, who this year had risen in category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is justly Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach at the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team rise to the second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continues without winning out in Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, meanwhile, expands to six parties his indictive drinking in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of his opportunities in front of the visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, since his direct game caused all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but he spoiled his occasion when he found himself in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to lie down to try to finish the past of Craig Halkett's head, who crossed the gate.
The locals were already fine to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whispered a fault against Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and end up from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but met with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage was repeated on the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to do a credit stop.
For his part, Rangers Porter Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow eventually diverted another combination play of Livingston.
The Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging over and over again in the Livingston area, only to be rejected, and two criminals were claimed, one for a supposed Halkett entrance to the Glenn Middleton substitute, and another for hands, both of which were dismissed.
Livingston - phenomenal -: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to surpass all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their gaming style and staff have hardly changed since their return to the highest category, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since its arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be pending Menga throughout the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Even though the bright moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely not been able to keep the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (just once they clearly overcame the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is at the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Freeze reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's income in the EU.
Erdogan immediately moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police raised security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, but a large number of followers gathered around them to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also made themselves felt as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and entitled dictator by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A cyclist dies when he hits a car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The vehicle driver stopped and, although the paramedic services attended the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a run-through incident on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the Saturday crash site.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report facts to the nearest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in an altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison center, according to the center's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and still persists.
Specialized agents moved to the site of the facts to put an end to the altercation, in which eight prisoners were involved. The unit was able to contain on one side.
Agents had to be cared for by slight injuries to their faces at the scene of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesperson: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident that has occurred in the prison of Long Martin, which continues.
Six employees had to be cared for with injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons.
There are over 500 inmates in the Long Lartin Penitentiary Centre, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be held in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-asset agents acted as a prison presence to solve a serious altercation in which downtown personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with important streams (dry areas could be beneficial)
It is not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen at the beginning of the coming week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued floods alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday, and to arrive on Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only - two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the border with Arizona -
The most recent models in the national center of hurricanes forecast 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would be recorded up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of rivers, the rain of the Rosa may become very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will touch the ground on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with a tropical storm force the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According toweather.com, - expect from 75 to 150 mm total rain from Baja California to north-west of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm -
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before reaching the border with Arizona at the first hour of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
\"The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what's left of it is very high rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west U.S. desert,\" according to the national center of hurricanes.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in deserts, as well as land slag in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the area of Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace, about 4:00 on Saturday, local time.
He was moved to the hospital, where he is \"stable\"
A 17-year-old boy, two in 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in Radstock, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some sort of recording of the facts with the mobile phone will get in touch.
Trump says that Kavanaugh - has suffered from the pettyness and anger - of the Democratic Party
\"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote on the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has spat on the pettyness and anger of the Democratic party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress Thursday, persistently denying and emotionally accusing Christine Blasey Ford of having sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in relation to his ally.
The president said on Saturday that, that day, the American people saw the genius, the human quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
\"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable trajectory of service to citizenship,\" commented the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the index of participation of Republican voters in the elections of half the term of office.
We're five weeks away from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did -- he said.
\"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates.\"
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to -- resist and obstruct --
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place as late as Friday, according to the CNN an assistant of Republican party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged through the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast towards the sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
\"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground,\" Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had shifted by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he comments.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photographers published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of stores and destroyed buildings is appreciated, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The mirrors continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as \"considerable\" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he comments, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 strays.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications - were totally paralyzed and therefore no information of any kind came from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There, more than 300,000 people live there - he commented on the Red Cross in a statement, adding that his workers and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse\" he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday not to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media shared amateur, you can feel like a man on the upper floor of a building gives desperate screams of warning to the street people about the tsunami approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts on the shore of the sea, taking up buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a generalized cut in the electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuated continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths for the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where employees sit in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the ride they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
\"They told me they saw many houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although the aid groups made the devastating gesture of starting relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It's still a provincial disaster,\" said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross Indonesia.
\"Once the government says - well, it's a national disaster - we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared.\"
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept hope of the miracle and their loved ones eluding the devastating account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy caught in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paragliding team coach, had trained two of the parapentists missing for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were their students.
\"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,\" he pointed.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the fact that he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the parapentista community, he had desperately sent messages for WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
\"I think that means that the messages were not received,\" he added.
Some thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated to the statement that the vehicle driver was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man \"came running behind Brink's employee\" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames Ye
The Kanye West rapper is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: \"Being formally known as Kanye West.\"
For a while, in West, 41, the motorcycle with the nickname Ye, and used these aliases as the title of its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, in which you are expected to present your new album, entitled Yandhi.
The raper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for \"emotional motivations\", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
\"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,\" West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
\"So it's you, it's us.
I've come from Kanye, which means the only one, just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confusing part, everything.
Album is rather a reflection of what we are.\"
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their name.
In Sean Combs he has been known with several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former contributor, has valued his nickname with or without dash and capital letters.
The President of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is needed for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a cruel repression against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that \"the military force would never be used to suppress the Mexican people again.\"
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left-wing student student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
he said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to the AI
\"While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field,\" says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments arrive after several members of the U.S. Government have announced measures in AI, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 of the world in terms of innovation in AI in 2030.
\"Duplicating the budget for research in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are very behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advancements in the field of AI,\" Lee pointed out.
\"Duplicating funding could double the opportunities that the US will achieve the next major discovery in AI,\" Lee told CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the society Innovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that overcame Othello's American player with the best ranking and later exercised as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively valued previous technology competitions from the U.S. Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
\"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,\" said Lee.
According to Lee, \"it is not China that takes academic leaders; it is companies.\"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the US task in the scope of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
\"I think permanent residence cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI,\" he added.
In July 2017, the China Council of State presented its last-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
\"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public agencies in the United States give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China,\" said Lee.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the constitution of a Selected Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Natural Sciences Foundation is concerned, it currently spends over 100 million USD a year on research in AI.
Meanwhile, months ago no measure was applied in relation to American legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide if they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the \"Republic of Northern Macedonia\", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has secured its entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether there will be a minimum of 50% participation necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper is, \"Are you in favour of NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?\".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that was created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life,\" said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have indicated that it will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported no irregularities occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which he voted 66% of the people registered.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski to the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
\"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our head high, not the back door,\" Kavadarkov exposed.
\"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
\"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,\" Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a \"yes\" would be the \"confirmation of our future\".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a number below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian Telma TV chain, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared that he would vote \"yes\".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for pro-Western government policy since it took over the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scored after the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory goes for 2 to 0 in the disputed party at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the minute 65 in a play that looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He marched by speed between three Brighton defenses, tearing out what came out of his way for the playing field.
Later, Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He stormed a defense before overcoming a few more on the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The English front turned the ball into the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with the right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that was glued to the inside of the network on the right side.
\"Agüero has foot trouble,\" said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to journalists.
“We decided it would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate to have scored a goal at that time.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
Its goal reached the minute 29.
In that play, Aguero received the ball in depth in the Brighton field and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The front of the Sky Blues ended the ball inside the network before leaving the bottom line.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase at 6:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off struggle, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out to the launcher's monticle on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a game of advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play-off.
The Rockies secured a fiddle with victory for 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but still seek their first title of division.
\"Although we're not playing anything, at least we can go out to launch knowing the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably dispute every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?\"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer throw away if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session Thursday and launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 deletions per strikes in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump is rallying in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
\"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big, I don't know, but actually I do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see their pettyness, their ill intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them.\"
The mission of Democrats, he said, is to \"resist and obstruct.\"
\"And this can be seen in the last four days,\" he rebounded, and called the Democrats \"enraged, petty, gross and false.\"
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, which provoked a strong writer from the public.
“ Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a number of British parliamentarians who have told us we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he was resolutely protesting anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, these are, ironically, similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
On Friday's nottingham Labour Party meeting, he reported that \"we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.\"
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of \"more generous and kind\" policies has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerating the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as you co-workers who previously thought he was sharing a similar political view hoped that I would turn 180o and take positions that I would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just about me.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the messages I'm getting are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a stream of gender-based and racist attacks every day, and are not scratched.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is seeing how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with each motion of \"not-trust\" or every change in the selection rules, the party became stronger.
In the last two years I've received a lot of advice and I've been advised to keep my head down, not so expressive and \"it would be all right.\"
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, encouraged by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left my entire class literally sinked, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local advisor or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey was not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of no renewal of my candidacy or political interest will prevent them from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr embattutes lead the leadership
Two last-minute essays distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership Day game.
The Ayr, who are the only unruly team of the ten, occupy the first position at the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed because of its defensive superiority and the fact that he learned better to take advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
\"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still down, so I have to be happy,\" he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose op: \"Congratulation for the Ayr, they have taken advantage of the occasions better than we have.\"
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over for the Warriors' party, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayr with a sanction and, just half of it, noted and converted an essay to put the 17-5 marker in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury Ruaridh Knott suffered, who retreated into a litter, and at the dam the Ayr re-enlarged the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Next, the alternate Captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a placard in Climo without a ball, since the penalty alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-test behind the Ayr penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost once again since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a jute from David Armstrong and passed the ball on the third line to Gregor Henry to score the fifth essay from the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hospitality sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his comical couple for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source of the newspaper The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's \"flowering restoration sector\".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without coast, hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their airship covered in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a flag of sea blue.
The bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are soaked with the slogan: \"The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.\"
Behind Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of raw resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the yearning to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest ones in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
\"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, you must not say, wait with a positive stance the result,\" pointed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit into the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the next year's re-election, also holds many hopes in the resolution of Monday.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,\" he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide for Bolivia and that, if it does, things will not change very much.
The United Nations system based on the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territories and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
\"The current Bolivian Administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,\" Zárate pointed out.
\"The belligerant rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,\" he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have \"an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile\" and an opportunity to \"end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,\" he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
\"Bolivia will never relinquish her right to access the Pacific Ocean,\" she added.
\"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.\"
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho states that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a burning thought that the continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a statement that ending the Korean War could make North Korea never kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not do major disarmament movements before.
Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is taking seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of large hats, on their way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which clouded the style defined in the Fashion Week of Paris.
This summer the Instagram has been swept up by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's featured piece was an exaggerated kiss hat, adorned with a broad wing, feathered shape, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other accessories oversized, there were jeweled syndries, a witch's hat and, even, a pina, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Eyewitnesses of styles predict that huge hats could implant themselves in the main streets near you.
Large-sized hats step on the heels of \"the Bomb\", a straw hat, with broad wing two feet, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in bather that carried it.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, adorned with raffia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the prominent piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 de Jacquemus in the Fashion Week of Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: \"I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language competences are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain an academic excellence trajectory that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer a service of the highest level to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, let's note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak him in his own language, you will reach his heart.\"
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the research tests, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A note.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of the students obtained a superior A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Competition and Competition Commission revealed that from the reasons given by employers to the fact that it was difficult for them to cover the vacancies, 17% was attributed to the lack of linguistic powers.
Hence, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these competences are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages being taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest is, he can always choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future stands for.
In the global commercial environment of today's time, it cannot be denied that languages still have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered \"international communication powers\".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-temperate game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you play.
\"It will be more than one and less than 48,\" said Walton to the official Lakers site.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After the early trainings this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-party pre-temperate calendar.
\"I don't need pre-temperate games at this stage of my career to be ready,\" he rebounded.
Trump's Mite in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump scheduled meetings for next week, which include visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are issued in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia rally can be seen online in the link that is specified below, through live video broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to object to this week's hearing with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the sexual abuse charges he is facing, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote is kept waiting for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans present themselves in the delicate November elections to charge momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at \"stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
\"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we head for a campaign season trapped,\" pointed out a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, Reuters said.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather supporters \"of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,\" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the surveys.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give impetus to the polls,\" commented Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows their ambition to keep their hopes alive in front of individual Sunday parties
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon forsomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic now?
\"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive drink,\" Jordan Spieth declared as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both count three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The gutural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as it continued its turn and put in a crucial putt to tie the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar cry, the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
\"You must try your best and worry about your own game,\" Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave footprints.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple who did not make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bullying public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is set on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning furball hero, who paired with Alex Noren.
A madey and two doubles at the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had any choice of leaving.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the pairings, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly and again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a favorable marker of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and Saturday foursomes with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave his record, up to now, on four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an unwarranted American team in the morning's furballs and set the series in 3-1.
The US presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known with the nickname \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who wins four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they knelt a brilliant performance to beat a disinfected Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sparks, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and forsomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning furballs, remarried Henrik Stenson to the foursomes and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as the world's first and third, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on a pleasant and windy day in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point on Saturday for Americans getting two points.
They won a 2 to 1 strong victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and later again won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did a team have made up a four-point difference to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a title advocate, only needs to tie up to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm \"in no way\" if no signs of trust are appreciated
North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their distrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world organization that North Korea had taken \"significant goodwill measures\" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing themselves to not proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
\"However, we don't observe any U.S. responses,\" he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri resumed the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a \"by-stage\" denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization entirely, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim undertook to work on \"the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" while Trump promised assurances for North Korea security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
\"The US insists that denuclearization must first occur and the level of pressure with sanctions is increased to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the \"declaration of the end of the war,\" Ri pointed out.
\"The perception that sanctions will cause us to kneel is a burning of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.\"
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: \"If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea rather than the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation.\"
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President \"Mr. Evil\" Trump called Kim \"Rocket Man\" on a suicide mission.
Today in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to \"completely destroy\" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this and that \"it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.\"
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council that \"the sanctions application of the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearisation.\"
The Security Council has unanimously promoted sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making \"own demands from a gangster.\"
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took \"measures in consonance\".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the \"measures in consonance\" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
A new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extended, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic observed that students at the number one university in the world are often misguided by what goes to the basic aspects about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
\"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said: \"Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year.\"
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, one hour long, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dorm room, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, babes and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, on how it affects sports performance to the lack of sleep, and on the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily path.
“We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,\" Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever greater problem.
Ensuring to enjoy a sound of good quality for long enough should be a \"secret weapon\" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in way of insanity and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, as he hopes, is to ask graduate students to conduct a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the \"blue light\" that emit the electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house that is another tripping out.
Ibrox's set sought to add his first home victory from last February's triumph for 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, at 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half part, and never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, was about to equalize the marker.
While the Rangers now falls into the sixth square, Livingston climbs to the third position, behind the Hibernian by different goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulty later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the grace.
Gerrard made eight changes regarding the alignment that swept the Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven headline who kicked a spot against the Hearts last week, and he must have been pleased by the way his team, well organized, smothered its rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two-minute game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder jumped sideways and wasted the big occasion.
A bluntly missing launch by Keaghan Jacobs ran into Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a detour at the back pole.
The Rangers were made with control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a criminal at the sign of the fifteen minutes, as he and Steven Lawless came across, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only directed two juts at the porter's first part, but Ibrox's first porter, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's docile front.
While the first act of the Livi in minute 34 could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were not able to deal with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the pause to change Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, the change had an almost immediate impact, as the end made a pass on Morelos, though the imposing Kelly rushed to the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long walks, one after the other.
Holt's band could have yielded direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a detoured jute from the corner.
The replacement of the Glenn Middleton Rangers still demanded a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from Sunday Morning - Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm - Hans - Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ultimately resulted in the device we know as a Geiger counter
Count Geiger, who is a science pillar since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado\" starred by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that emanate from radioactivity to minerals --
Evans: \"I'm sure you're breaking up now.\"
“Hans — Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to - see - malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to - see - and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can see a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory for power-seeing a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and later re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): \"The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine\"
HER2 protein - favours the growth of various types of cancer - including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting in extracting immune cells from patients and - teaching - to these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West branched into a pro-Trump dial with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't turn out right.
Kanye West was written into the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would be present at the 2020 elections.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
\"Whenever I talk to white people, they say, \"How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago -- he said.
The SNL program began with a parody by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for the sexual assault complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not issued, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's disapproving footage to social media.
It wasn't clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated among builders because of the hat he wore.
\"They threatened me with constables.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position -- he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: \"You want to see the lower position -- while he said that Superman's cover would be put in, so they couldn't tell him what to do.\"Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love -
His comments provoked the audience's writings at least twice and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: \"The whole study was completely muted.\"
West behaved as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the interpretation of the song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West obtained the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest spirits: thank you for distancing between the MULTITUDE.”
But the presenter of the debate programme, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply - being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful -
\"But I've chosen not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his art) who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so did we -- he added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed and that it was now — being formerly known as Kanye West —
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His raper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed its name to a symbol and later the artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of murder in temptation for stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the stabbing of a man on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the court of first instance in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The throne game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of espadadjí Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Throne game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the virile hero stereotype, stating that these roles lead to understanding that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine in The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed that something had gone wrong and that he was questioning how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently been married to the Co-Protagonist of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted to being quite determined to face this problem.
\"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity,\" he says.
What we've taught men during their development in relation to the problem we're now experiencing --
According to Kit, television can have part of responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this face of virility?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because surely something has been wrong with young boys --
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any log game prequel or sequel when the end of the series is planned for the next summer, all saying that he is filled with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will feature a reposition of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that has provided him with Thunderplay.
\"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead of me,\" she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character who represents Kit, Jon Snow, in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what used to happen.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to the statements of Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Senators of the Republican Party and dismantles - dangerous lies - and - conspiracy theories -
US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands prompted criticism and extreme right-wing websites.
“Thoughts, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate's commission on sexual abuse complaints against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
-The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this filtering of information.
This baseless complaint is completely false and pure invention -
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
\"This denial is full of indignation,\" Fleischer wrote.
This makes him think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
He has to keep calm and serene.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being overly angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the middle legislature elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
\"Important if it's true,\" tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
\"We will make sure that the offenders are revealed, continued, \"and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have taken and that they have harmed each and every member of my staff\"
Critique by Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of the franchise of Johnny English's parody of action-comedia, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satisfying about how despicable we are be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent exit eyes and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to torture everything, his name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquat glamour, has a little Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the Fire Cars issue at the inaugural London 2012 Olympics ceremony.
Originally, it was based on the international traveler and mysterious Atkinson who represented the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There is one or two good moments on this last journey of I.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the leaves of the helix were repeating it to the helmet.
You see the gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite low and strangely superfluous, especially because he has serious movie brands - such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined to children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the silent gags of the character Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's dismay, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this placarded character of Teresa-May, but the script does not reach any further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy becomes endangered, he will have to recover some retirement.
And that includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall by an emergency meeting with its Bough Sequaço sufferer, role that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly to Her Majesty's secret service come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular - fatal woman - Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of technological billionaire charisma which states that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous bogies: disguised as waiters, burning a French restaurant of fast food, seeming chaos smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a child's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five of them.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers giving them one more day's party.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would fit in with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a working week of four days is supported by trade union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party declared in The Sunday Times: \"It is expected that a review of the policy will be announced before the year ends.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in the party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the party's general industrial strategy --
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly today.
According to a Labour Party spokesperson: \"A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it\"
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of the \"anonymous directors\" and \"speculators\" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shade also imply that water companies shareholders might not recover all the investment, as the labor government could apply - deductions - for the crimes I perceive.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers at company joint ventures and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who hope to bundle annual dividends for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in [60 Minutes] whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings might influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent for -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could get them into something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I'm serious,\" said Kennedy.
At the session, I said I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and secure --
But Graham's vote seems on fire.
\"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive accusation,\" he said.
\"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly refused it -- he added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And none of the people who appoint will be able to verify.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star show, which carries out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of the year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the event to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (bet someone wants to pay for a VIP entry), attendees had to do a series of tasks or -actions - such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that she has 12 years left to reach her goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case than we call \"clictivism\" (since they think it makes a difference to sign an online request or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million shares of its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies comparable to over $37,000 million, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from their shares, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that for the time being the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and performers with them in the United Kingdom, which is committed to - helping children grow as much as possible - and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
\"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page of history,\" said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on your website that asked you to -- what makes you think we can end extreme poverty --
Global Citizen replied: \"It will be a long and hard way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights movements and against the former apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger --
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will act in the fall event in New York, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a \"blocking\" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretariat of Interior)
Washington can, if necessary, resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed US Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern slope of Europe,\" he said supposedly.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
\"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that marine lives are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees to the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defined itself as the energy consumer voice in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
\"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,\" he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to come out of the North Stream 2 (inadequate) pipeline project, which Trump says turned Berlin into a Moscow 'captive'.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak declared after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the United States to move away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will - he will think in a halt - his nomination for the presidency in 2020.
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that - he would think detinctly - his candidacy for the presidency after the election of half-legislation.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, let women hold high office,\" said The Hill.
\"After November 6th, I will take my candidacy as president seriously.\"
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said that he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
\"I'm frankly worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,\" he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms in Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said, \"It's clear that we need an FBI investigation before the election.\"
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's -probable - electors have said the senator should not be presented, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed broader support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the affection for TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
\"With what's happening to my own son since his return, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers return with,\" told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest - the elephant in the room - and said the following of his son and other war veterans: -they return a little different, they return stiff, they ask themselves again if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army members, have given to the country -
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charges for domestic violence were charged to a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district introduced a friendly curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his couple - and the children of the violent band member - assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy - ignored decades of state, federal and international legislation -
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denied entry of immigrants harms the US economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and -proport necessary jobs -
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
\"Assyle is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or relevance to a particular social group or political opinion,\" said Sessions in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
\"The environment is very tense,\" said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma mother while calming her child with fever in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
- Every minute, an ambulance wears bodies.
Lack of drinking water —
Residents have been seen to return to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as the patients are treated outside because of the heavy shakes they repeat.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think -- he told Haris at Associated Press, and he added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
\"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right.
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with propaganda advertisements
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Wednesday to China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, U.S., an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in US elections marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensified and that has seen them rush into mutual imports.
China's vengeful oranges at the beginning of the commercial war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, claimed that Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article to The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: \"It is redoubled harassment with the publication of advertisements to our free press\"
\"By disseminating their propaganda, the Chinese government uses the esteemed American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment announcement into The Des Moines Register,\" Branstad wrote.
\"But in the kiosk down here in Beijing, you'll find few disrepute voices and you won't see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He added that — one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the publication offer — his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the mid-legislation elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
Because many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming mid-legislation elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone - said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute pressure to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
\"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants shouted -- November is coming -- (November is coming) as they protested in the lobby of the Senate while the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
\"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain outside the graph,\" said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst independent of the news site.
People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among suburban women's voters and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote while they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his applications for sexual assault on the candidate at the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
\"This has become a mess for the GOP,\" said Michael Steele, the president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"It's not just about the board's vote or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh sits at the defendant's bank; it's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they've treated it,\" said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, in the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scale that is slightly decanting towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents undoubtedly or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe undoubtedly or probably Kavanaugh.
Moreover, some 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or undoubtedly during his testimony, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the candidate at the Supreme Court taught him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that intends to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was \"dominating the world\"
\"We have to do it now,\" he said of the emerging company.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own — personal online data storage — or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in one browser at the same time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it \"personal empowerment through data\"
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to-Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty overnight.
- We're not asking for permission.
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new integrated website on the Solid platform -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergy in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in their home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann got the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons discovered a commemorative tombstone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was \"magnified symbolically\" that the tombstone was present exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guarded prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal - through a very thick fog and under intense fire of cannons and machine guns -
Later he ran toward the line of fire and, with the - highest courage - made the row advance before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment absolved.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat that could never equal, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a genuine hero is demonstrated by support that he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and refuse to see the most important event.
San José's sign contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, UK viewers were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted that they would spend the night awake until the morning to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change in cartoons as a sort of puke acudit.
\"The government's regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inappropriate, so they switched to child programming,\" said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication from Bellator, when he was asked about retransmission.
\"Pip the cocot, yes\"
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
\"I think when I think about the repetition, I think it can work,\" said Coker.
\"But there's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't notice until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give -- hope -- to other people.
He also said that being a father was of great importance to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off by illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first program, said he felt less than others because he was not socially acceptable as children and children.
He said, \"Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.\"
He wanted to prove that it was -- something -- he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when he found out his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image the Commonwealth of Australia's June Games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others hope.
The world's trichampion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, - he caught me by surprise -
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 older than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass by so much when you are young (he took part in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age as he experienced high and low.
The couple were parents in June of a child to whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, - his whole perspective - has changed.
\"If you'd asked me last year, all I needed was an Olympic gold,\" he said.
There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is said to be just like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was to die and one of the last things he asked for was whether they already had the entrances to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him, Father, you won't be there to occupy the first row,\" he said.
\"As I took his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, which was already dead, which I finally accepted was not invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
\"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at some Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,\" he declared.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had listened to during the preparations for the Olympics and that he was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson introduced himself to the Ryder Cup Saturday
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical state if he does not want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event to beat a record for 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the modes-furballs- and-forsomes-of-saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends their time between making animator and working in their game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National trajectory, where the long rough tends to punish the deviant strokes.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, on the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points down when starting the 12 individual parties, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
\"He understood perfectly his role for that day, he slapped me in the back and rolled me around with his arm while he told me he would be ready the next day,\" Furyk said.
\"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a hall of fame and it's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move on.
He wants to be there, like any other --
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a race to the Ryder Cup that has not equaled its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
\"It's fun, sarcastic, joking, it likes to mock people and it's a great partner for the team,\" he explained.
“I think younger players also had fun messing with him this week, which has been fun to see.
He's a lot more than just playing his game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seven Ballesters had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won the victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“You keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the marker at 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that are not yet finished.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This isn't over until the points are up to the marker.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the focus to do it.
I've already said, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also keep in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world --
enchanted with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: \"I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's fine, but individual duels test your ability to play golf at the most.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Right now, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself as well.
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to surrender better individually than in team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's rendezvous, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing in the \"Miracle de Medinah\" that won Europe.
\"I remember exactly all the words,\" he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, was motivated by his players before the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start with good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, much pressure is generated on these central duels.
We have prepared alignment according to the circumstances and in the best way to try to do magic tomorrow --
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rendezvous against Rory McIllroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
\"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,\" Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new fragate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not, at least, until the coming year after defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz - the main ship of the new class frigates Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships the Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen class fragates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bump missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new fragates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were predicted to be able to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already news last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the drassana Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why he has returned, but the German media have cited several - material and technical - defects of the ship that made him unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew required for the former Bremen-class fragates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
Furthermore, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Armada's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much class ships as the Germans used during World War II.
In addition to defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some amazing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new fragates have become a matter of special importance, if you take into account recent warnings that indicate that Germany's marine military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has recognized that the Army - is running out of ships that can be used -
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg fragates could join the Armada.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret lives of bats.
A new investigation carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscape to feed themselves.
Discoveries are expected to be able to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, in addition to northern and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track ratpenate activities during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they use them each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lumenate also pose a risk, just as the paper kills and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful to them than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to place insects and obstacles that stand in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the proper training, carrying out polls, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in the usual way.
Even, the organization has created the first and only Scotland reserve dedicated to bats on the Treave Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bat.
The farm administrator, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
\"Here in Three, we have a great area for bats,\" he says.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow.
Notice the importance of checking if there are bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could result in the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, molest them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, official of the Scottish ratpenate conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, \"We still need to learn a lot about bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population.\"
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are - false news - and has claimed that people - want to become famous - thanks to his name.
Her lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at his time $3755,000 because the incident was not made public, according to the information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video by Instagram Live that addressed his 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were -- false news --
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news -- says five times winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
They want to make themselves famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order - he added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers already prepare the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as — inadmissible information of suspects about private life — according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for — moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years —
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino suite.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where, presumably, they raped her on an anal basis, according to the reports filed at the County Courtyard of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was a -99% good boy - except for a -1% -
The documents maintain that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because she was - because she was - afraid of the retaliations - and worried - she was publicly humiliated -
The 34-year-old woman claims she seeks to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix it for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he's set for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing automobile manufacturers
The United Kingdom would always regret it if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was - worrying - that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had claimed to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need an agreement,\" Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of an unagreemented Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the models Auris and Avenues of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
\"My point is that, if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped,\" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Director of Management in Burnaston.
Moving out of the EU without agreement on how trade will work with the other EU countries has awakened the fears of other UK automobile manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW states that it will close Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the case of Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a — just in time — basis with pieces that arrive every 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector considers could cause delays and shortages of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to retain inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future EU relations is — precisely able to avoid these border controls —
We want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity, has told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
\"The testing not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains\"
Toyota was unable to confirm for how long production would stop, but in the long term, it has warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union at the plant, has said that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: \"By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.\"
A government spokesperson said: \"We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.\"
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could, as he continues the fight on the nomination at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired the deputy attorney general or not and risked Mueller's independence, he's fueled the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of bringing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House between rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump has stated that \"I would rather not - say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee hearing to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: \"No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be that one more week is due for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists might refute this statement: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the gossip of TV journalists, although he said: \"I won't deny that they're farts.\"
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
\"The president does more questions and answers than no previous president,\" he said, before adding the following without citing any sources: \"We have consulted this data.\"
Sanders has said that the briefings will continue to take place, but - if the press has the possibility of asking the president of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States --
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service in fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months from the exit of the EU United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of residency claims for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: \"During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems to be moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible agreementless scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the task of health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here --
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury

Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the half part.
\"He came to the sideline and collapsed there,\" said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the band before placing him on a bedside table and taking him to do more testing.
A Tennessee State official reported to Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left chirophane at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that -- there is still no information about the type or range of the injury -- and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season in Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it came from Illinois.
He had completed five plazas on Saturday before leaving the party, which makes a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Farm expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to have a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to lure young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
It hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open their way on the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become \"phantom cities\" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure arrives weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great buildings of keeping the prices of the properties by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's \"real estate disaster.\"
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rental controls and the completion of disenunciation - no fault -
He also wants to give city halls more power to build new homes.
May has said, \"Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on property is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes everything even more real --
Jack Ross: - My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland -
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, has stated that his -- greatest ambition -- is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently occupies the third position in League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support and that's all -- Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
\"But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but --
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coaching office include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's trainer claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of consecrated names on such a large team, after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"For now, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it is evident that its place is the Premier League - it has stated.
\"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just consider I've been successful here if I can get the club back to it.\"
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid descent into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was probably a decisive moment,\" he recalled, \"remembering to accept the position in Alloa.
\"I've always thought training was what I was getting better, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I went out reasonably and enjoyed pretty good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure from work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard since I'm an adult --

Summer heat wave has fired consumption at bars with difficulty from Britain, but has added more pressure to chains of restaurants.
Bars and bar chains have achieved a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has been reduced by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial counsellor, the company that collected the data, states: “The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World, which has expanded beyond expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption at the restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have been reduced by 3% -
Paul Newman, of leisure and hotel analysts RSM, has stated the following: “These results continue the trend that we see from the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external trade market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales of 4.8% interannual would be especially detrimental, rather than continuous pressure for costs.
This summer so long and warm couldn't have come at a worse time for the trades serving food and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed breath -
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including newly opened ones, has been 2.7% in July, given that it indicates slowing down in the presentation of brands.
The sales indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in the pages -Insta's fakes -
The news has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a \"principal\" account that they show to parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has heightened fears about publishing sexual content.
About 20% of students claim that they have a \"primary\" net account that they show to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to -- to rape me --
Research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, of which half have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"voices of athletes\" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish athletic federation directive at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scots medals and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from their widespread international experience in the last decade.
\"Eilydh has respect for the community of Scotland's athletics, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,\" said Beattie.
Doyle has said: \"I look forward to acting as a voice from athletes and I hope I can grow sport and contribute to Scotland\"
The US, which won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a BBC regular commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's about doing agility exercises!

An announcement of cartoons comparing mothers to cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A spinning company has divided its opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares lactating mothers to cows that are being grounded.
To mark the launch of what is considered the \"first silent tiling that can be carried from the world\" the technology company for the consumer Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a joke musical video to show the freedom that the new trigger gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of gossip and cows at the rate of a song that includes letters such as, \"Yes, I'm very fond of myself, but you won't see any tails\" and \"In case you haven't noticed, they're not bragers, but my breasts\"
The tornado continues: \"Bomb, pump, baby food, pump, pump, munyo girls\"
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim that it shows the \"horrors\" of the lactic industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and bet to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after they've been born -- wrote one person.
Elvie strip is discreetly hidden in a lactating bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented, \"Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to announce a puppet for mothers that will keep their babies--
Another user added: “It’s an out-of-place advertisement”
Other people defended the ad; a woman admitted that finding the song was — fun —
- I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
Announcement is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It's a great product - he wrote a user.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun announcement for mothers to pump with strips (usually at their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the pull-off discreetly embedded in the bras.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel as if they were cows when they use the trigger.
However, the Elvie strip is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactating bra, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even exit while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and first-born developer of Mother, said: “The Elvie tillette is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By tracing parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a pull is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, at the same time that we demonstrated, in a entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new trigger.
It's not the first time Elvie's shot is on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of emigrant children held in custody has increased even though monthly entrances across the border have remained practically stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to adhere.
Traditionally, most godfathers were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to risk staying in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible godfathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
‘Almost 80% of people who have hosted or lived in the home of a person who has taken in are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people — he declared Albence.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court in a month after being held, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than by face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports that they have made known the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is most likely that, due to its size, signs that indicate a child is suffering are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say good-bye to friends can cause them a trauma that already suffers many.
Syria urges the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and - the matter will be dealt with accordingly -
\"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,\" he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the \"war of terror has almost ended\" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He has said that Damascus would continue - fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory - of both terrorist groups and of -any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a war-affected country.
On the subject of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed — some Western countries — for their “irrational” range that make refugees want to stay away from them.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
\"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.\"
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area in the last major rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has a clear “terminism” and expressed the hope that military action will face jihadists, which include Front Al-Nusra fighters, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be eradicated —
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to -review the articles of the current constitution - and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the process of destitution end their presidency prematurely.
What would, of course, be the end of a more dramatic presidency in history -
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of peak timers has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million high-time viewers, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and (The Rachel Maddow Show) from MSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights.
\"People have seen it bounced because they don't understand it,\" says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series \"Designed Survivor\" on a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club — has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
‘Why,’ she asked.
\"He answered me because he laughed at me,\" said Scovell.
There's a entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, Washington's script could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources - for private use - for his book -Fear - Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket - a piece of thick clothing like his pride - held the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrific descriptions that Stormmy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
\"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new,\" says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of \"Pawn Stars\" on character changes and Trump's script spins (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose any episodes because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunk outside the house it has on the north coast of Kauai, but it was closed by looking at MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
\"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" Fleiss told me.
\"I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it seems they were right --

External money floods middle-legislation election races in the most tight House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the Congressional districts that has made two current members compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the plaza in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the 17th District.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has sparked a financial war between the major financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a highly followed special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have held office for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners took out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for recent decisions on not recognizing Taiwan, declared Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department, this month.
However, it was only contemplated the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 US aid of $140 million, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death figures for murder and unemployment.
With the pace of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any chance of punishment for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled now for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives to it, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to their positions of Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House in Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to administration and also from anonymity, corroborated his statements.
Study history
The next event in which it occurs could be the special prosecutor's report Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
For what is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the organization, just when he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Checoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of inflection points today.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein states that the Times information is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And especially, are we going to vote a Congress in half Parliament that's going to hold Trump accountable?
If we don't get through these tests, democracy will start to be in danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles at that table with swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, party-optimist against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receives the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw to the Vila-real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to rank himself in the G-Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the season's first minutes until the 2-2 draw against the Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to achieve great results.
\"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team,\" said the 31-year-old player.
\"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else at the end, but in general, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than them in the second part.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can keep the three points, but it'll be a tough game because they got a good result at the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it everything and get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave past the season and succeed --
Women lose sleep because of the fear of survivors for retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to the family about it.
Approximately half of respondents at the national level claim that they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they've talked to their children about it.
\"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't dare to think about it,\" said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
We need to start around here.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you can prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include a policy of insurance for traditional long-term cures, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses or insurance of your own with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the pace of legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person who supervises your medical attention and makes sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary appropriation for your finances.
You need to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old family has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Specify these details in a plan written to be ready.
Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also with which doctors you want to deal with it, Martin said.
- What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready -

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, according to the authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since communications are cut, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Donggala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cellebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Cellebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it concentrates, mainly, on Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Firebelt and earthquakes are usually produced at a certain frequency.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed below:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, in northern Sumatra, sparked a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and provoked a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop zone in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra and provoked a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and resulted in destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of great earthquakes took place on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested with domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspected domestic violence suspect, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Center, where he is held with an unsecured $500 obligation, according to KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was pronounced \"not guilty, surely\" when asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A failures, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
It is also accused of a class B lack, which can be punished one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are recorded.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a gun in a drunken state in relation to the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.

At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian Isle of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just on the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had met at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Request an Exceptional Death Penalty for a Suspected New York Terrorist Attack · Global Voices
New York federal prosecutors request the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York terrorist attack suspect who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane in the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims (intentionally) and that (intentionally) caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty presented in the South New York District.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal juror attacked Saipov with a 22-false indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable -- planning and premeditation -- and described Saipov's way of acting as -- inhuman, cruel, and depraved --
\"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco - according to the intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not to be guilty of the 22 fault charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, claimed that they were obviously disappointed with the decision of the prosecution.
\"We consider that the decision to apply for the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt and a life imprisonment without freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize popular troops” today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
UKIP's former leader has stated that politicians must \"feel pressure from Eurosceptics\" when one of Theresa May's own members suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The non-custodial Conservative MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom would be already outside the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the Conservatives in favour of the union presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to retain his Chequers' commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the supporters of the Union and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave de Solihull that he wanted to break Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already!' she said.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament added: \"I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' commitment.\"
To further his opposition to the EU, he added: “We did not fight world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country -
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that stated that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: \"The idea that the British population has changed their mindset and wants to stay is totally false\"
The conservative party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters: \"I'm just telling him, prime minister, that he listens to people.\"
\"Chequers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win a election.
Abandon Chequer's engagement and start listening --
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: \"The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.\"
Mr. Farage said that the rally politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
\"This, now, is a question of trust between us (people) and our political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're here to tell them we won't allow them.\"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: \"I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.\"
\"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.\"
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched for Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists fluttered banners on the conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at Conservatives about security issues they faced with party application at the beginning of the conference.
\"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada deal plus, for the friction-free border, for free border-free trade in Ireland,\" he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Bo Brexit added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual criticism of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against the representative of the state of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
It has been a speculator centre on the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The evening evening event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents with the open meeting format since Trump took over his office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome --
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for death was arrested by the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at the TE press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the meter man.
Sims, 20, got shot and died near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
\"Wayde Sims was shot at the head that finally killed him,\" said Police Officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas stood ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he was in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in a good position much of the career, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen, and move on to the fourth position.
He finally entered the boxes at turn number 44, but he could not increase the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen stood in fourth position.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real lord who was told to let me through.
The team did a great job to have a one-two, said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday rally to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of Ford's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are -- ill, cruel, and lying --
\"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people, bad, cruel and lying,\" he said.
\"When you look at the communications and the leaks and they say, \"No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... did you filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't filter it --
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't filter it.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak his story,\" Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
\"He asked me to be confidential and kept it confidential, as he asked me to.\"
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the Saturday night rally: “You know what? Her body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen --
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct for three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
\"They are determined to regain power for the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to amass to have power and control, said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the Friday defeat of the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal advantage thanks to the late Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who were just winning the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaull attendance four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this agitated initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team to the game in minutes 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first pause when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at mint 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home, at Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An air controller in Indonesia has become a hero after dying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and sparked a tsunami.
Many mirrors are being produced in the area and there are many people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the trembling control tower of the Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport airport airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure Batik 6321, who was on track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died in the hospital later.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Siria, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
\"This has broken our hearts,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
\"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been reached,\" said Sutopo Nugroho's representative.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross works against clock to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
That's already a tragedy, but it could still get worse.
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, \"I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
You're ready, the CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that was going to crash into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional passenger details requests, such as its age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane tied to the pond because the runway was short for him.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the runway off.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The US Navy said that the sailors who had been working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable vessel to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concludes her case on Saturday in the review of a man's trial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness of the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the accused's 29-year-old motion, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that that day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville --
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that only a week ago they knew each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
“He deleted it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be held by the jury throughout the same day.

Another black person?!
NY's nanny asks a couple for farewell after a \"racist\" message
A nurse from New York has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was -- another black person --
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand with a \"extortion\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER NEGRA PERSON” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her pitiful, a - uncomfortable - Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, all claiming that the nursemaid she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and, later, sent her home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice demands the couple a compensation for dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately USD 350 a day for the six-month residency work for which he had been hired, although there was no contract.
\"I want to show you that you can't do things like this,\" he said in the Post Friday, \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple responded to statements that they were racists all claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people - the husband, Joel Plasco, said in the Post.
\"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on.
Plasco, who has compared the demand to a \"extortion,\" said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a \"very difficult situation\"
- Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude - he added the investor banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: \"It is difficult to put herself in someone's place than the tie for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success --
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the child's book on a small hairy bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, and he also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was - aggracious - after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and I'm adding that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” she said.
\"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit —
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When they landed, they rushed their daughter to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
\"Nothing often called to say it was very serious and they didn't expect it to get over it,\" said Mrs. Ednan-Laperese.
\"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him to keep his body beating were consuming and were getting out of his system.
He had died before what was planned and so he turned it off.
I just had to sit and wait, as I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the good forms--
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter's loss, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
\"No one knew it,\" he said.
\"He had his head and tears never stopped falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for overwhelming Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, she was killed.
\"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day,\" she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
\"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room--
However, he abandoned his work before he died because he was on a very dark spot.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after his own life had been taken away.
Mrs. Davis said, \"I am continually concerned that there is a side effect.\"
Mrs. Davis created the cards - because people know that there are people who can come to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
“She never said she wasn’t feeling well or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we observed a change in attitude.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is held by a thread as the FBI initiates an investigation
\"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity,\" said Mr. Flake on Saturday. \"He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the supporters' dead end.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
It's only five weeks for the mid-term election of November 6th, if, as expected, Republicans don't get any good results, they're going to be weak in getting the man they want out elected to get to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea - cau - with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unification said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
Usually, most deserters in the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seül's sources state that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized area (DDZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders from both countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on standing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear power free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,\" said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says that Brett Kavanaugh is a \"hysterical\" and that he is not fit to work at the High Court
The minority leader of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate at the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a \"historical\" and that his temperament is unable to work at the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been told that she is a \"hysterical,\" Pelosi said in relation to his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the accusations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him amounted to a grotesque and coordinated assassination of a character - organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work at the High Court, as he showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
\"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,\" he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's choice, if confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"That's what I can say: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only not able to be in the High Court, but also in the court where he is now,\" Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Appeals Tribunal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he did not ask questions as to whether he would annul decisions of the High Court.
\"It's not time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Tribunal and expect us to look wonderful,\" said Pelosi.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and it can't get out without crying.
\"We're crying when we get angry,\" Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's uncommon, and you\"
He went on... \"I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was also crying when I was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when I was angry and started crying, tell the person I was talking to: \"Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then he continued.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as output for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where once I cried with an indescribable rage, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little bit) who took me from the clatter and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
\"Don't let them see you crying,\" she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll get you --
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extra-marital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
\"It wasn't a well-considered decision,\" he told me while he reigned 30 years later.
\"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, \"Blancaneu and the seven dwarves.\"
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind the fundraiser, so she promised she wouldn't get into the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave the men $1,000, were only willing to give her 250.
\"They think I have a discount,\" he asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and orienting the voters, rather than the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was left speechless.
\"You might have thought you had a nervous breakdown,\" said Mrs. Schroeder. \"The reaction of the press.
\"You could have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, \"What are they going to put in my grave?\"

How the trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial saves of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distance the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning early this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new oranges affecting products worth $20 billion, these oranges assume a tax on half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way and has recently raised the oranges from five to ten percent for 60,000 million dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the US and is not likely to have the second largest economy in the world coming back.
Making Washington back involves giving in to some demands, but leaning publicly in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
\"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had planned,\" says Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is \"ready\" for refugees to return, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Maualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
\"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help in building the devastated country again.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that funded the insurgency.
Europe's selection achieves victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the US election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times in European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election won the crown again when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the blow out of the water in hole par 3 16, which yielded victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
I can't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important -- and I'm glad I could help -- commented an excited Garcia after European victory.
Pass the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the North American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
\"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players who ever lived, with 14 great winning titles and just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. election fought all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: \"I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a time when we pressed the European election.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been your captain.
There's enough to get your hat off.
We've been defeated.
