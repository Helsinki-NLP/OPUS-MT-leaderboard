The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: 29% in total
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the populist parties on the right led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Domenica in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously fading, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the under-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5%.
Even worse it went for ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major games in the Austrian history of the Post-War and above all the literally catastrophic result of the populars, who have sparked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they had the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that they could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the electoral outcome, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populists - liberal parties (FPÖ) have gained 18% in advance and BZÖ 11% in votes - but socio-democratics have simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when populists have agreed with the populars to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) which was even the ground for sanctions by the Euopean Union.
This evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
In Parliament, too, the Green Party has been able to enter, but has fallen slightly, going down among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, it would happen according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
\"If it did not resolve, then it would happen a certain cooling,\" he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the accused and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
\"Your problem could be solved,\" said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a superior instance.
Then you can ask for bail and await the ruling in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same way during the negotiations.
\"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace,\" said the Czech head of diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the matter, is to give the convicted the competent legal support, has supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been being sent to India for many years.
They also admit it to the Indians,\" Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
\"We really consider a profound mistake in the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists,\" he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained from the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter.
\"I have obtained relatively many promises, and I have only noticed.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabeds
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and the adjacent marine areas.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
‘The island belongs to Australia and together with her the seabed adjoining.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuoxo, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and repeatedly adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still conceals a little known world full of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that they carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest backdrop on the mainland
The coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica are defiant.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
That has under the Convention an exclusive right on all the resources of the continental shelf.
In a few words, the continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles, explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Committee on the Defination of the Dimensions of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical and professional assistance.
The Commission has so far addressed 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful - adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia that has greatly expanded its marine possessions has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear in the future from the seabeds, as promised will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually present their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the Montego Bay Convention has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the seabed begins, which the Convention has declared as the common heritage of humanity.
No one has ever been in an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
\"But the seabed is not Klondike,\" says Director Mikulka, \"because its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.\"
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization - Interoceanmetal -
This gained in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors in a few other states, the status of the so-called \"Pioneer Investor\"
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the ‘wide Pacific ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is fragmented, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
‘It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a challenge to show him.
It looks like a small potato or a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested aid from Germany for the release of the hostages - the experts have then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
There is more and more detailed information on the circumstances of the release of the 11 hostages in Europe.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, GSG9 units were present on the spot, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the technical institution's logistics experts.
As the spokesperson for the ministries announced on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
\"We didn't come in luck,\" says a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Aggressors kidnapped on 19 September in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said, that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin, for when they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper-Bild, the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. representative camera rejects the rescue package.
The first room at the U.S. Congress has just failed the 700 billion dollar bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 items towards 227 the American representative house rejected the government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and top-ranking politicians of both parties there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been levelled.
In a dramatic action the supporters have desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy 700-mld package of dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffering was ongoing, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must be blessed both in the Chamber of Members and in the Senate.
Proponents register figures increasing reservations
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak vision of conjuncture the desire to travel Germans while in an investigation remains firm.
On reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a 31 % turnover plus compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV said Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, there are also increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
So the excess travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be about 11%, the DMV reported.
These results are assumed to be GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
They would also include travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak price of the dollar, which would be required in particular to travel to the United States, the HRD reported.
The increase in reservations here would amount to about a third.
In addition, special demands would be made for travel to the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in Germany.
Most of all the journeys included have a high quote, explained the president of DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be - better calculated for customers than for a vacation organized individually -
Consumers could save money through, among others, bookings discounts made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would again be an excess of turnover - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year dropped.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann's Hits, mouth beer from one liter and vip in Griffati Dirndln.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
You are blonde, television moderator and wear a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
One thing, though: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves against us and taking pictures to fill the memory of the cameras - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how friends are made.
The two-money Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually residing north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dining until today remains within the limits.
And once you got to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks upset or embarrassed - everything perfectly normal.
Only the end of my Dirndl collects strange eyes at the banana stand in chocolate.
A monk tells me that I would have misdirected the flock: “On the left you are free, in the middle of six virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow”
I'll just sort out the back to the left.
All right - he says it and laughs.
Others are less wasteful of subtle flirt techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which the cape “To drunk to get dressed” and stretch the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with performing inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it - Gorgeous - with a straccata -oooo.
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a liter first.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, of which everyone thinks it's a rink.
Bob is one of these starving \"Wildbiesler\"
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening they walk blank on the square of the feast the health care, who have to take care of the poor beons
The nurses appear in white every time - always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered rod into the tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Whoever lies under the roof in this liquor bar in the blood, you can't see.
\"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn\" yells at me one of the sanitizers and disappears in the baron.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on the Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the charge of unwarranted driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate the Turkish border deeply.
On the eastern part of the Bosforus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaiscimental style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most westward.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delayary to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions plunged during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, he has gone slowly out of place, largely out of history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is now a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has considerable good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kinilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bulging race along the tracks that produced the cadences from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn behind his Ottoman past.
But AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and power bakeries, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
The purpose of the foreign political party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly, and it tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its homeland.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with either one or the other.
They must be both.
\"But certainly at a certain point,\" I ask, \" Turkey will be forced to decide\"
‘Turkey,’ she says, ‘doesn’t want where to deal with that choice’
Then it underlines a point that almost all those I spoke to here have recited in memory: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message appears to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those rail lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's medium-eastern ambitions can now, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosforus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called - the sick man of Europe -
At the very least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to move on to this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon-Tod-Handley (necrology, September 11th) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful young choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21 under the 21st years, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name “Proteus” (the mythological to be-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that the music presented to do, both madrigali and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to - let music speak for itself -
He said: \"The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So sing it.
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowered.
Whatever the musical standard was, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight as a conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades when he drove the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and often inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply - they rode around the world one or two well-known battle horses -
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your essay by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, a degree in letters and a PhD.
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York universities.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.

\"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition \"Flamenco y vie\" because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.

Second round for Honda Supersellers
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great living space, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Everything needs to be added to a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth reporting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique sales phenomenon.
That is exactly the case with Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Nearly a million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .to reduce the drop in sales in Spain in good measure.
In fact, the company's managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold units, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% decrease.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain by 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
Moreover, Japanese society expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to succeed, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters in excess), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters in excess) and the range is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the baggage capacity - with double background - rises to 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the baggage capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - involve an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in the models with a gasoline engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both machines include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model makes it possible to use a power of 90 cv at 6,000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 nm. at 4,900 turns.
Propulsion - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces about 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first generation model, there are now 100 horses available.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The ‘appe car’ to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and particularly by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, by taking the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the home-producer vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates an oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing are the eyes composed of bees, able to see in all directions with a angle over 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have defined as a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately allows to prevent collision.
“When an obstacle is detected, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and changes direction immediately by turning on the wheels at a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
\"If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,\" explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn up or down, and even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can turn its wheels and not exploit endless directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega-
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instant prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan wants will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to destination by avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Tremend before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging with mutual trash in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: “Bad Credit Hotel”
In other words, the \"Hotel of bad credits\"...or problems.
The tetro aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist is used to induce not to think one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information the game provides is useful, but is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a website for the vast public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house isn't even talking...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of participation in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares in Stock Exchange.
A week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would have bought 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity securities at the individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to three billion dollars.
The price established shall be less than 19% of the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a yield of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would take place on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars per year, a percentage below its current course of 28%.
Around 17.00 the title Morgan Stanley nevertheless dropped from 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
\"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to bank holding company,\" explained John Mack, director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's greatest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than the one previously made.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum equal to $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: \"We thought our share of participation would only be made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves.
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price lower than their 7% accounting value.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on the basis of the diluted —
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, over a given period, the latter were traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow them to seize investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide details regarding the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has made it clear that she has greatly lightened her budget since the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen half the value of its shares while the cost of risk insurance has suffered an impensation.
However, the cost of the month was at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other - superstitious - among the great investment banks of Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had collected $15 billion, partly from the Berkshire Hathaway, group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales et of Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted - yes - to the referendum, on an 80% vote basis.
According to these results, the -no - were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing victory of the \"yes\" placing between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had, moreover, claimed the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
The \"Constitution has triumphed gloriously\" had ensured, congratulated the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 km south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in complete calm according to the mission of election observation of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the \"new socialism\" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy and reserves to it the \"planning of development\" of a country which lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to be able to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to exploit this amendment and to redeploy its application for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freeness of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of a Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and healthy, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15-30, on a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to deliver any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy \"good health\" and no ransom has been paid - to kidnappers - declared on the landing track the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
As soon as September 19th during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been thrown from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer claimed that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before dawn.
\"There have been gunfire, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled,\" said the manager who asked to keep the anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the unit - lightning - were sent to Sudan, where they would have supported the German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result, it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces - he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan (SLA_U), the statement immediately rejected by the latter.
Literature - The silent majority of culture
First page is a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in shade.
Who will pronounce themselves to denounce the poor amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
At our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all of this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the very ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise a part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market, by means of partial nationalisation: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland on the weekend agreed to the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in discussing the international financial market for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions made in this regard may be a precedent.
Under the decision taken Sunday night all three states will detain almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all assets, especially insurance, of Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares on Friday fell almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering current stock prices, the group's entire capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank managers, this value is not real.
The company's summit blames for the collapse of Fortis actions on the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already made sure that investors should not be afraid to lose their money.
Among the bank’s customers, there was no panic, the subsidiaries were not assaulted.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and also acquired leasing firms.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of data on the purchase of medicinal products.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
There is a privacy program that the use of prescription data for the drugs depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox - - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies shall subject the insurance rate and the amount payable in the event of damage to the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not provide for insurance.
The client had to undergo a medical visit some time ago, and the contract was concluded only after the exam was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the client's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicine he bought in the last year and a half and from this the evince program of what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
e.g. if you regularly purchase large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the blood fat level is in practice unbelievably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so besides paper work, there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the counters there is that some medicines are usable for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or heat vapors, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance point of view - commercial, as a risk-increasing factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, companies have been formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some said lately also elaborate the results of laboratory tests and link them to the medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more firms have access to data and in parallel the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specialised in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links the additional data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
Then at the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Martial Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly together, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the summit has also been dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will take the lead in cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member in the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, acting as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative to the Foreigners, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also take the lead in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both parties, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both parties had a role to play in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference planned for the next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will be present in the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting he prepares to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors the French firms will receive a trade worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry of Heritage and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with an Italy Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the press meeting at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the status of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books on the total Italian production gradually decreases, and in particular on that for adults and young people.
Found Steve Fosset's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane was recovered, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
The raids were found on an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, has escaped the doubts that still remained: \"The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he was missing,\" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that some hours after the sighting of the wreck was sent a team of tenants, who then identified the apparatus: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was scattered from 3 September 2007, when Fosset took from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A SUV outside the diagrams with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and net corners.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the offerroads (compacts) of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new sale in this sector.
Just for its content outside the traditional canons, will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
Thus the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D affission campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi-affixion project, composed of three different phases, will dominate the very central Via della shopping milanese, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car exits the manifesto.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then returned to a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertising.
Will he be able with this formula to excite the interest of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From the Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of which all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group - Ultras Italia - which has been following for years the Blue National and which so far, for the truth, has never created any excessive problems.
He never had a fight with the hostile fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia groups (small units, actually) were added from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colour flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed to be unidentified.
They're inspired by the English typos.
In Bulgaria they found a real Nazi typo, Levski's.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominations, then easily controllable.
And the Viminal had controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been deprived of attending a stadium.
In fact, four blue fans, who had previous crimes since the stage, had been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo that prevents attending not only the Italian stages but the whole of Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is to say, to those a little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
\"We must immediately turn off this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,\" they claim from the Viminale.
So, \"good eyes opened especially in view of the National game of Wednesday in Lecce\"
In Puglia there is in fact a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cassms which can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium itself.
\"The Duke-Duce choirs and the stretched arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not wrong.\"
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappily way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Taggliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been an estor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to swim at the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
\"I do not make the sociologist - he adds the No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the act takes place.
So far this group has remained on the line, we will now see what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we also talk about the anthem of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me not to be an education.
