European inflation has declined in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dramatic growth in the price of food products.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: - we have to negotiate - on inflation so that it will not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, struck the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was spread in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat prices increased by 88 per cent and soy prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold almost $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 percent current to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 to 4 months about 3 percent, yet the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Democratic Youth increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while Gallup had never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of safe party voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democratic Alliance would not reach the necessary limit to have some parliamentary space: their support within the entire population is about two percent.
There are one percent more supporters among safe voters in both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point above - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the economic situation in the country especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, the majority of the population is suffering from the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth of them are awaiting improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was rather in the wrong rather than in the right position.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent do not trust the President of the Democratic Youth Alliance.
One of the indicators of shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots of last year 35 per cent estimated it would be desirable to hold the Government and the Head of Government in power, at present this proportion is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, in a general election to be held this Sunday, only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent of the population would certainly believe that they would participate. Based on the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt that the result of the popular consultation was a result.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of educational rights, 79 percent of the medical consultation service, and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment for medical consultations and the payment of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
They maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent of the commercial gold triangle hypermarkets in Budaörs, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Buddhaörs Gold Commercial Triangle the usual Napi Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above 1,000 HUF.
As in December last year, prices in food supermarkets had already been - fired - so there was no drastic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUFs, today they can't even do for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and fish liqueur remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our estimates, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so last year's Christmas prices felt the increase in VAT.
Just this process was the process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in consumer prices.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the circulation of a product, it may lose a significant profit in the margin that is adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF at the value recorded in 2006, while the difference in the cheapest was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was catastrophic price growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets it grew more than 30 percent the price of consumer items of first necessity.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases just 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which could impose a drastic increase in prices even for multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three shops visited no longer are interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, large tails were formed in all three shops in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to poll institutes because income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year a number of thousands of infections first produced by the misuse of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overcrowding of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the head doctor of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
An injured car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection by multi-resistant agents have been recorded in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that the number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded in hospitals, and there is no information available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of human beings carry in their nose Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsilitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once antibiotics are exaggerated or improperly applied, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics become very resistant bacteria and quickly become infected with inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as injury infections or sepsis in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with weakened organism, to elderly people or to those with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection with the epidemic should not be confused, the MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistance
These patients are isolated, the nursing staff attends them on rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment,\" Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even so can infection be prevented in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - Karolina Böröcz says.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and homes of elderly people, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, taking microbiological samples is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in public when MRSA infections are already occurring visible in the patient - said the chief physician of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict orders for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological pictures.
Antibiotic therapy should be undertaken, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
They therefore play a very important role in hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but in this regard there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA was contagious by means of droplet transmission and direct contact between individuals, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Furthermore, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated for at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation it saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer such infections are recorded or the pathogen may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to have success, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a tendency to decrease in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by district police commander XXII.
It can be excluded the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a state stunned that since then resigned commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passer-by - reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control that it had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station in the XXII district, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle by doubling to Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This latter fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always yield the step when doubling.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was greatly touched by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Research Office of Budapest.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian finance minister János Veres and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total amount of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit contract of a value of EUR 100 million, the contract that they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved EUR 300 million in total for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will use primarily for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again address the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging commission for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country, which has just been mentioned.
What, where and who buy in the EU's even cheaper market, will quickly get worse?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly no Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the \"Costa Dorada\", the \"Costa del Sol\", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people seek real estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - like Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia may be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski havens.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to later renew them.
They require good communication and access, also for them is important the proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
Buyers of chalets are the second category (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fuck and the six per hundred Hungarians
The meeting at the expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday following the official inauguration, as reported by the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particulars between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to reach an agreement that, compared to the situation in 1990, until 2020, it decreases the emission of greenhouse gases by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member steering board, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the \"Piac is Profit\"
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 2020, with respect to the 1990 level by 20 percent its greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether or not the post-2012 agreement will be signed, and is willing to commit to decreasing even 30 percent if the other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also ready to take on commitments in line with their responsibility and capacities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the 1997 Kyoto Protocol's signatory countries committed themselves to decreasing by 5.2 per cent, in which case the 15 EU Member States then committed themselves to meeting 8 per cent of decline.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the greenhouse gas emissions from the period 1985 to 87, which our country will comply with - reports the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
Much is at stake in Balí, since the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed within two years, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed by the end of 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was warned in its latest IPCC report, the UN international scientific partnership dealing with climate change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, the reduction in emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, which scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits YouTube · Global Voices
British Army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general operating body of Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded on the Internet and their channel has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name of “defence headsquarters” and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the British Nations Community (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruiting objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda is practically nothing compared to conventional television recruiting spots - the BBC has been told the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the carefully edited and censored recordings, there are also popular videos in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the propaganda films - officers - a little hypocritical, the officers speak of maximum losses, without presenting yet the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with video shooting games, downloadable for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can be put directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombol and pastelillo salted at the Christmas feast of the ministries
The working minister Monika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with salt cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will hold your party with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you have fun the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
The children of fallen soldiers will be given gifts on the Christmas of the orphans and the Christmas of the Missionaries will be invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Promotion Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred workers in the ministry are expected to be attended by approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the party of the portfolio will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, will also act artists and will draw from the drum.
The birth of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have failed to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the feast of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which, instead of Christmas, held the dance of the day of Lucia on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not collect anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the [origin] question they reported: to attend the dance was not required to dress dress or dress at night.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department will inform - will take only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, in return, will simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own action hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, the Ministry will not hold Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception on foot, to which only specialized diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the press departments have communicated to [origin].
In the press department of the environment portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will be a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while the final vote on the law on public health will begin on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the law on public health.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail transit will be fully stopped and workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
It will also be the strike commission of LIGA and the National Union of Machinists that will coordinate the actions of Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will speak in an indefinite strike, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the law on public health, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Assembly's Monday, it is also possible that only a vote on the law on public health will be taken at night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways it will cease to work indefinitely, in the morning it may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volan companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approach, they are increasingly the people who travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13 o'clock the workers of the Budapest Collective Transportation Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electric and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators' Unions called a strike of 2 and the Educators' Democratic Union from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take action on a national strike at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) that are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and introduces a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that, in the case of advanced pensions, it is possible for the occupations that deserve it to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Capital Policy[b1]: The Hungarian Guard's risk is increased in the country
According to the Division for Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
In the company's \"risk warning\" it is written: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the highest political risk is the fact that, with the worsening ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypian people of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of such an event - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all of this was due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: - the protagonists of public life gave up the public debate of the gypsy problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to substantiate their political strategy on the differences between gypsies and Hungarians -
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the National Guard's activity, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the country's stability and democratic development -
They remind us that, as of the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups of Hungary was increasingly publicized and encouraged, and that since the summer of 2007 many organizations have been set up in the country that self-defense of national self-defense associations.
\"The common feature of these groups is that they self-define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for the defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, of the state - add.
They stated: this is all done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with political and political parties.
So to highlight the civil and the form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this influences the political stability of the region - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliiana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization ' s objective is - national self-defense -
In his view, over the past 17 years, there has been a “Gypsy terrorism” in Bulgaria, but the State has remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - the Political Capital recalls.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Bulgarian Gypsy organizations have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also Hungarian Gypsies react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
The research director of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász, to the news agency's question, stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as occurred in this case, by posting their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holiday days - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are the parties united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, state parties and holidays.
Holidays primarily relate to religious festivals and historical ephemerides.
Let us also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the last one especially so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May, the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November, reminding our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, two-day parties in our country are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so often it becomes bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends thus, no work or school can be absent on previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not compulsory on the other hand for companies and service institutions that, because of their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24th, life is practically stopped in the country, since according to the experiences, most people - make bridge - during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid- or weekend, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be changed around the work party so that the workers can rest for four successive days.
On Saturday, April 26, it will be a working day, so that in return on Friday, May 2, it will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the feast of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year will be able to rest, since from December 24 no part will be worked, even though the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little ones to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass to us without realizing: they are all part of our Folklore - daily work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department - says one of your colleagues -
That's why you didn't go on a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to repair the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to sound explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to take a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find it.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but this morning it disappeared?
Can you find your missing pen at the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking for them, because they will rightly be angry with you for subtracting their things.
Do not take over or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Chismeas about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know about him.
Are you on sick leave unwarrantedly?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and unbearably hurt your head, feel bad or well, feel like that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your impossible tasks, your work on the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know ahead of time that the next day you won't go to the office or something will happen to you, so you will have to stay home, comms, so your colleagues or your boss won't have to confront you the next day.
Streets, laughter, telephone calls
You're in your job, but you're suddenly getting the laughs of your colleagues from him?
Have you involuntarily heard a telephone conversation that would have been best not to listen to it?
Do not bother your colleagues with your Tarareos, chants, conversations aloud (less when you do them above their heads), patals, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, nor the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must correct the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: Very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disengaged, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
Lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning attack.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and the previous tones add the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and although again fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are developments under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, dancing electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national discs, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as the only national trend formator, capable of selling it also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether they are wearing this label or not.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the angry, about the flight, but in addition to the angry of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with The Puzzle set.
The album includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station took high-flying music from Wings of Love to the ears of the broadcasters, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of public selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be dull, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Outside, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
Not only did the 15 and twenty-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather to the West of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
In the beginning it was inevitable that we would compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On the success list of Mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our record.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-sounding soloists from our own national musical scene.
Thus was created the choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly that song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song had long existed in instrumental version and when we already had all the disk material, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came almost to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are at the bottom simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously didn't want to distribute papers from soloists.
The song also speaks about it, about that we forget for a while our ego, who who from where it has come and where it goes, let us leave those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
He would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What else did you do?
Zs.B.: In the music composition actually to none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything was put to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new record?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already - deleted - the disc.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous purse runner risks billions for its inferiority complex
An evil disloyal.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French bank giant Société Générale, also owned by the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, to good abilities.
He intuited the crisis in the US mortgage market, unlike all the large Czech banks.
\"He has a fragile character,\" he heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what translucents the French media, such as Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year earned more than 1,6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
\"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,\" he says.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity was already seen by her at the beginning of the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did it correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1,6 billion euros.
“When I’ve already won my first 500 million I don’t know how to notify you,” Kerviel confesses and adds, “that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had forged the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even cheated on the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became beneficial
Were you afraid he might find out?
Rather, no.
\"I thought I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.\"
Where did he get so much willpower to risk himself like that?
In my position it was necessary to work gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was managed between $51,000.
Two years later he was a runner from Bolsa and in 2005 he became a broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Even so, I knew I'd never win as much as the others.
In my first interview in 2005 I observed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress, Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the London bombings, playing down a 500 million euro title.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
\"This is like a snowball,\" said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it.
\"While making money, they closed their eyes.\"
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost one billion euros.
After the weekend to mid-January he wanted to delete all prints.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
\"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file - Kerviel ended.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The Czech government ministers yesterday signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will come out for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund which will next year have the amount of 90,8 billion krona.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve employers and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly-registered countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the former President of Nicaragua, the court ordered
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeals decreed the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the $100 billion (almost $1.8 billion).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear right now, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in line.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez, it will be more dependent on prison officials if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German constantly transferred money from government to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictional and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how the budget was approved for us.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote on confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, calmly adopted the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but in it lies the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of communication and therefore devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of the last Social Democrats' governments have suffered three shortcomings that by this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of compulsory laws, called as expenses of the agents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the \"silent\" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit in the State budget.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
At present they do not have this resource.
If we adhere only to the official facts and verified, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is happening ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for your government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for the massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have become useless with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform will not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, to rule who governs it will only be a mere bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little we can say that politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the taxes for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the agents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who govern to become officials only for this reason we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than a hundred billion dollars by tendering.
In these tenders the banks substantiate the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send $40 billion to bid, and then another $220 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend - wrote in your report to customers, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
“This coordinated action by central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
\"The central banks must be truly afraid of what is still waiting for them when they decided to take this step,\" said ABN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies.
\"It seems that the situation is really wrong,\" he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay more dearly to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves even when the US, Canada and Britain Central Banks reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
\"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,\" told Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the move taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are amazing
Climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
\"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,\" Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that this is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, many times I only meet with the caricature of my ideas.
Now stakeholders can learn about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, according to his opinion, sufficient assumptions to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so big and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
The questions asked by the present group repeatedly explained that it is not against - the reasonable advocates of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take the relationship between costs and benefits into consideration -
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people did not manage to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore failed to change their old driving license whose validity ended at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for change so that officials can take them from time to the end of the year to issue the new sheep.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will find themselves on the roads without the valid sheep.
According to traffic, the sheep have not changed it primarily those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of meats, the metropolis offices are full of applications and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 daily clients.
In the queues it is expected a half hour.
In Prague the new sheep has not yet been taken out of about 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new sheep lasts for twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the sheep within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are obliged to change their sheep and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid sheep will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offence with a reprimand.
In the event of administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderately fines of a thousand crowns, at the most.
According to the voice of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving card is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over the driving card.
Just bring him or send him by certified mail to the municipal offices.
The meats issued in 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driving meat.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 are up to three years old to change it.
The validity of the sheep issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to the accomplice detectives of Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided to finalize the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department were going to be plagued against organized crime, and they were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he is primarily awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other cases it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused's accusations were rejected by the investigation as cases of invention.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of criminal groups avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without permission of arms.
In the home registry, the police found some guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, robbed them tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this case, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pŭt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change some children: 12 million
To change some children in the Maternity House, the lawyer of the families affected, Igor Veleba, wants the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For every mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
\"This demand we don't approve, it's too high,\" Dostal said after today's meeting.
In order for us to come up with an idea of this counter proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterpart requested to investigate.
We'll see if it has any rescisor value.
We maintain ourselves in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone - Dostál pointed out.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jabloň wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress from different levels and depths.
The stress situation was best endured by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Motherhood House of Třebič last year, on 9 December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation costs for the error made in the hospital of Třebič which the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must draw from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask the administrator for help.
The court has recognized them as a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polyvka lost his plea about the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polyvka did not show up at the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably unfinished and his client will appeal.
“The plea is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polyvka,” said after the trial, Polivka’s lawyer.
For him, in view of the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
We've been working for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities - he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
\"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that this is why I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work - he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polyvka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic origin came a lucrative business and business activity of which Harabiš created later the society Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polyvka agreed to use its name and sign in the passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors on their farm and attendees at their shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polyvka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Polyvka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia,” said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today's broken parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polyvka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the “rey Boleslav I, the chosen forever”
The main role in the kingdom, by means of Harabiš, came in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polyvka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court to date.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
- We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the King's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polyvka can be introduced - Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices exceeded
I've never really liked Peugeotu 206.
Its gait characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the header space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi bodywork means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the World
I'm going through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backs.
Also unlike model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
The above-mentioned shortage of space in the header disappears in the Combi.
Chestnuts in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
I must value it as very accessible (thanks to the down front gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic system has a capacity of 428 litres which, compared to competition, is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, we find that the Peugeot stays in the distance with its 52 liters perceptibles.
On holiday abroad or by placing the child's carcass its value is critical.
But if I have to comment on something positive then I have to quote the flat that remains quite flat after lowering the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four valve injection ignition on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth this is how it should look like a 1600 that would despise the family member five doors.
It's quiet, it consumes little, and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas of that time that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was capped by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices Respond
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection ignition per 329,900 crowns, can still be used.
Our aggregates put it from 410.900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Just that we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's got the equipment's complements in Fabia and it's going to come up with a pretty similar number.
It is now only up to which of the two marks is to be decided.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries are assisted, so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronchi between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatm's police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green pole.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack of two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls hugged him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting.
When I told him to let him, he gave us the handkerchiefs and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass - he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be achieved, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea Island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island is there much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered it to build one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings emerged, with wide avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and at Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita they left their signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians of all America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita go away you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the dear Hotel Nacional you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those automobiles already of cult of the 1950s, until today continue to function for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have been oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the Old Quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there are nearby.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and in islots such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the narrow-track sugar factories on steam or electric machines.
Its drivers for tens of years have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose brother models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that at the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting him.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rocky lands.
Mogots, limestone pylons and rocks of high cliffs in the falls of the valley, and in their caves they acclimatize fertile land thanks to which rocks that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the habanera factories of pure can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean side of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old town abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambiray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby areas such as the Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town on the west end of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful one on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that reach there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most well-known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pure, Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, Santeria, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all this could be filled many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission's march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not working as expected, and representatives of troop-contributing countries in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh (Escocia).
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to pursue greater activity, Britain saw the priority of strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
Development in Afghanistan is tangible but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population themselves to start economic and security development - the BBC station, Minister of Defense, Des Browne, told the Minister of Defence.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year in 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
\"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of the soldiers and teams we'd need, and that's a little bit of it,\" said De Hoop to Reuters agency at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Is Passive
Among the participating countries in the last few months is the controversy as to whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands to fight there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vague.
“The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troop played a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159,200 million crowns.
However, in early December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion krona due to improved state budget economics.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842.7 billion crowns in late September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Throughout the past year, the State was indebted to more than 111 million crowns.
-For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could pass the crown billion border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 90 billion and the billion crowns - said for the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees this as well: “We could pass the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation in the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change would not be seen — it added.
Doubts grow
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit in the state budget.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal indebtedness of the state grew from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The external debt for the time being has grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,3 billion crowns.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion krona z since June was reduced to 13.7 billion krona.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent of what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform - Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
From the state's payment and debt management strategy for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, the Ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion krona due to improved state budget developments.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit in the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the anticipated 91,3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidating agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner to finance state obligations and 1,8 billion kroner in payments of European Investment Bank loans.
He compared today before a court to Jartum for having given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan to insult Islam has been sentenced to 15 days in the afternoon by a court in Jartum and to expulsion, her lawyer indicated.
British was accused of leaving pupils 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable to a beating.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School of Jartum in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the school's teddy bear.
Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed, the principal of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear's picture with the following legend - My name is Mohamed -.
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, - I just feel that he has asked the children to vote for a name - it is only he who says it is an innocent mistake.
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who describe it as - very attentive to their students - and - who never speaks of religion in class.
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules governing the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
No agreement on the future status of the province was reached on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
\"We do not predict violence for now, but we are entering a very difficult period,\" he added, pointing out that \"obvious tensions exist.\"
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which regroup the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated to 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika was responsible for a further mediation by the UN last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this peak date.
Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
The Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo UN administration, the Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” said Kosovo’s president Fatmir Sejdiu, at Baden’s hotel, where negotiations of the last opportunity were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo rebel commander and future Prime Minister of the province, has been a part of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade - belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations -
- Domino effect -
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered for his part that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade is particularly afraid of a - domino effect - in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should only belong to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
- The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word -
- Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia - the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica, had declared.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end up as they have begun: in the Security Council.
To the journalists, Fatmir Sejiu had replied that - the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute - adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made - in consultation - with the West.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stressed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final regulation of the 60-year old contentious issue between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle — terrorist infrastructure — and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides' obligations regarding the path to peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt - to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues -.
This name covers the three main serious problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “globally and in depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing, inter alia, Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations are -direct and continuous - and to make - an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008 -
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the launch of its vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States that co-exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this sense by Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks - a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects -, he estimates Prince Saud in his periodic Arabic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this kind of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (PGN), a police car was operating on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Luisa-Miguel Street, at Villiers-le-Bel.
“It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without rotating light,” explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, - not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public track - (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated - at all gas.
He chased the police car on the left side, after a breach of the ceda the step to the right, he needed the police.
The control of alcoholemia practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The condition of the car (the ground front, windshielded windshield, torn bumps) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for - acts of involuntary homicide and denial of aid - to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the department of public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IPCN at this stadium dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge three witnesses of the accident, understood Sunday afternoon, they confirmed - the police's version, namely that this mini-cycle arrived relatively quickly on its left.
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been framed for the time to get the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGCN, being prudent, would also set aside - any serious shortcomings - with regard to this point.
It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, which needs to be very prudent - it specified a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows that gives the scene.
We immediately come down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw - a police officer who was totally terrified, who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young, the fourth spoke on the phone.
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the people present in the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief arrived - about twenty minutes after the police march -.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
I will not let the police services take no assistance from young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them - the prosecutor underlined for his part.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president - it urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore oath before Musharraf -.
- Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled -
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the next few days about the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, under the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge declared The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president - he no longer appreciates - after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday to the assistant minister of information Tariq Azeem.
It was hoped that he would abandon his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better ‘domination of fertility’, according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight births of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less per month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the nicest to have a child.
Spectacular repair of the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a solar panel torn apart and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments - hooded - by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that astronauts had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece in order to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But we must be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started rearranging the solar panels of the module that have a 76-metre scale.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that has been pulled in.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first to do an exit control of the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of 30 meters in length of the teledirected arm of the launcher added to that of the station to make repair.
It's one of the best spacewalkers in the Nasa.
High, durable, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been commissioned to operate the solar panel - inherited -
After inspecting the damage precisely, it sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of \"tables\" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second — spacewalker — who had stayed close to the air lock and, from the interior, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-bath wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and - capped - by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operating result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which provides the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of paying off the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft announced in October is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds no more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational outcome of EADS failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to burdens linked to delays in another programme, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group expected a first A400M delivery to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending electors today a televised message about the public channels, already registered but the contents of which are kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for Russia united, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself to hand over a new burden against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, no incidents, added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign driven by pressures.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there are no such dirty elections, until the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days imprisonment for illegal demonstrations, is banned from visits according to his lawyer.
The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo.
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections two much more open questions are presented:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to get to know each other.
Chosen in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever happens, in legislative elections such as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they don't feel the owners of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St Petersburg State University goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, - Putin restored the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by some economic eviction - Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation, estimates.
Today the Russians, by their own will, give up personal responsibility for those who had briefly proved after the breakup of the USSR.
- What to reflect for? -
The phenomenon touches on all the social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will they vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: - Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? —
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidential nature, the Nazi files of Bad Arolsen, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far accessible only for a purpose - humanitarian - that is, individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or his right-handling.
The eleven management States - such as France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to search - particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers - explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, objected to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, Indo-European bilateral trade has reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union Foreign Ministers had approved the European Commission last April to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Asian Association of Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already about EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
A free trade agreement will greatly double both economies, and India would improve its entry to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, justifies Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top 10 products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. Asian and European giants change annually by - 47 billion euros of goods - and by - 10 billion euros of services - this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential - The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned at alleviating the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the basic rate of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, as indicated in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 1215 GMT, at baseline and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts in the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that - it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the indexes - of interbank loans per day online with its base index.
The day-to-day interbank index was on Wednesday of 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis of the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with a significant rate of penalty that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, supported by the evolution of the change in the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and to a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS Party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles on the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
On Tuesday, the national office of the PS, including the increase of 50% of the surplus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) floating, a check-transport or rental restrictions, was included in a Socialist (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group).
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out
As a result of numerous rumours regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current movement of festivals in America - Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
By qualifying Glastonbury for - the most inspiring event - to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are stagnant in low-class policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss it with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that has recently taken place in Philadelphia.
C3 Presents rose the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after disembarking in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
- Melvin Benn's European model is a festival, while ours takes place in urban green areas, says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a festival of the European and urban manner in the American way.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event, says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states - that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. -
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is - very big - for example, that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators, says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - - politically difficult - because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the - runaway productions.
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
We have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oskares has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the films, give them courage and ensure that the performers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in Santa Monica folder and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in stock? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the closure of the exercise, the investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that, from the statistical point of view, the month of December in stock usually has a positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term -
Although they are not in favour of holding the stock chain in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that — the market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in the long and short sections —
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility - especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed types is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions -
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert assures.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% from peaks marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Still not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year by more than 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates.
However, the expert sees that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analyst, values that we are close to technical levels and - therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market -
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new peak quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that this year she's got great values.
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders - because when the date comes, the electrical sector will be very expensive -
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Bank, assures that the rise will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two December has been a low-income month.
The real rally at the end of the year was held in 2003, in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the pitch of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a rebound of 6.68 per cent.
It will have to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the moment the Ibex has risen 8.36 per cent since January) and if you can count on its end-of-year rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m. in the afternoon.
Another group that has also repeated several times that wanted to expand its branch schedules, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75 per cent of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the People's experience will be decisive in whether or not other entities are involved in this initiative, which is in line with trade schedules.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Pick up the particular customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on different streets.
In this way, the expansion of schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current, design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, claims that this restructuring is not a major investment, even if more staff are hired, since it is from having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will have even spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
People currently have 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the Worldcredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco first doubles the value in Bag of his rival Antenna 3
We did it.
With that phrase yesterday, he expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he observed that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect was his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've come down less,' he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain places its loss on what we've been in the year at 15.66%.
The value in Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antenna 3, who yielded 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this data were to be realised, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already valued 33% of Endemolo'.
According to analysts, the market is showing up at the moment of certain tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
They explain that it has cut the projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has dropped Antenna 3's profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: See Telecinco (acumulate) better than Antenna 3 (maintain) for the 'many attractive' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends in both cases to infrapond on having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which today ended with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the rules that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consensualize the best legislation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities for the markets to function efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join stock companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets add to the multilateral trading systems and the internalization of orders, which will compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disseminate information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to register all operations they carry out, in order to facilitate oversight by the CNV.
In its passage through the Economic Commission of Congress, a number of amendments were incorporated, including the fact that the debt-titled is considered a financial instrument - a complex one - given its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates can develop in economics and business 30 years after the actual decree defining professional functions reserved for economists was passed in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and may provide its marketing services for products and for the acquisition of customers to various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to match the final data, which will be released on the next 14 December.
‘The CPI will continue at relatively high levels’
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economic Affairs, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a - time figure - but at the same time he has hoped that the price index will continue at levels - relatively high - in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that, even if the figure is not good, Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains - more or less - the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November, there was less surprise than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
\"We were expecting a figure around 4%,\" the Minister for Economic Affairs acknowledged the fact ahead today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, he stored a record deposit of over £25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank revenues that are deposited over the next three years to get those remaining £18,000 million to reach the target of £30 billion.
The Richard Branson Magnetic Group, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of Virgin's consortium, in which three other companies participate, such as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested by the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
Today the Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) in the early morning for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Consistory and the chief of police in the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular deputy, and until then a town councilman, and according to sources of research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'capecilla' of this plot.
The officers continue to register municipal units and the councillor of Urbanism and no further detentions will be discarded in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, Juan Morales' lawyer, who was therefore outlawed, was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE by Toledo for the forthcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in the press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because - it is important to have the best - in political life and Bono - is among the best -
In addition, it has pointed out that - it seems - that the politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who issued his decision not to attend the next general elections on 15 November and to give up his career in active politics to engage in the fight against climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
It has also pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an act of transparency.
If he reaches the office, Bono hopes to turn the House into the house of respect and not the insult or screaming, and to make it - more and more like the citizens -
\"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak quietly and with rest is Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times.\"
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and - his good doing - and he has no longer wanted to see his place in order not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as \"prepotence\"
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement submits to unmerciful persecution of both the skeptics of their predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more of a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a - new contract with the planet -
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred and why their Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
It also requires the Spanish to explain with utmost clarity what measures it is going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be any such explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for company and individual accounts.
Up to the core of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE it seemed so dangerously to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that lord so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands, but adorns the myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not intend that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Detained by the mayor and the head of the local police of Totana for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murtian town of Totana, the \"popular\" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the City Secretary and a hotel manager for possible urban crimes, today have reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in which units are currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also come to the Town Council of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six arrests held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judge number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been brought to court.
According to the sources, the former regiment of Totana and today an autonomic MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, along with the current bride of the former director, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Immonuar's Suelo, an agency integrated into the aforementioned group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a very well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing which would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a spa.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the municipality's population, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the lively parking of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Catolico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It advocates, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way at the head of the PISA report on the world educational level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that there was, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of the philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy at the institutes -

A colleague shall provide information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The download of a song would be a six-month-to-one-year offence.
On the other hand, if you dress in the record store of less than EUR 400, it is considered to be simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous kidney has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be a penalty of six months to two years
(article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than lowering a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films by the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone's out of hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor takes me one of her rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
That is, that the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the comrades earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed”
The researchers observed that if when both were successful they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkans Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly chasing Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Court, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agridulence flavor, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at liberty.
His names are on that list of his title the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not debuted in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
What insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the sheep, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use of the car, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for being held responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the sheep, marital status, type of vehicle to ensure or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that more likely to suffer an accident, it is more likely to pay.
That is why both the over 25 and the women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinestrality due to their caution.
In addition, by taking advantage of the accounts, the companies have concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percussion.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver needs to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various drawbacks when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the low driving experience and the age of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can choose a whole risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at all risks but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays part of the amount of the sinister.
The amount of the customer's money will be pre-established depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount, specifies Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection from damage caused to third parties, even if not in the face of the causes in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid the claims as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, thus reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic fee.
The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase the bonuses - clarify Noguera.
After the 25-year run, drivers have the easiest time to hire a insurance, as the sinestrality rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
‘Youths cannot normally make use of the experience they have acquired before being used in an accident, and even at driving time,’ says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once already the ‘feed of the novice’.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risks, provided that his economic situation allows him, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinestrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risks with franchise (may be EUR 300), or, where there is a high level of bonus, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise - Luis Noguera ruling.
For retirees, insurance at all risks is recommended with franchise (from EUR 150), or one to third extended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack in order to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the 'Champions' liguilla, as Italians serve them to be first and Scottish to condemn their classification.
The Italians add up ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another one to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead with it.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete with the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on 13th in semifinals in search of a square for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in octaves.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to be ranked if the Shakhtar does not win, but it cannot be trusted because equally nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to make the Scots bitter the night, who trust to get into octaves for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated precisely in that round the past campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to which only the triumph is worth, in the event of losing Celtic, both to get into octaves and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend Vancouver's first Spice Girls Tour concert
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melani Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before their concert at the stadium GM Place in Vancouver that the group's meeting was brilliant -
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to watch the concert that included a video in which the history of the group that erupted in the late 1990s was reported.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage, wearing bracelets that had given them the husband of 'Push Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that surrounded the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star - has not seen our dresser, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show -
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 - because of differences between us - caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
- I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision - Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, - things have been arranged and we all love each other -
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, they were expected by an army of children.
Between five add up seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (5 and December 7th).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolic owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to paying 50% extra in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
\"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks,\" said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the news agency Reuters.
-The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on transit rates levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine -
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS - should test foreign workers -
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal record of employees outside of Europe, said a vigilante.
The Auditor General Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also showed concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses -Disclosure Scotland - to carry out criminal background controls, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the Auditor General recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the guide of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
\"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,\" says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but points out that: \"our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff -
BMA president Dr. Peter Terry said it was very unlikely that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that there are currently 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, partly because the joints have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guide for foreigners in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: \"It was of great interest to carry out this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film on the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
Trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named a better actress by the thriller - Notes from a scandal -
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - that has soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known by the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded two awards - to best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the center of another award in the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award to the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel - The kingdom of the crystal skull -
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, so named in honor of Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
\"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,\" he said.
I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor.
The awards to independent cinema, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world's largest oil supplier state television said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Supporters from Al-Qaeda have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declaring the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a \"missile launch expert\" who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in arresting Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants in fighting the Allied forces and in supporting the Shiita Muslim government, which is considered heresy by the most extreme Saudi Sunies.
Al-Qaeda militants have in their sight many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as their objectives residences of foreign partners to the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
\"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months' work,\" said the spokesman of the Minister of the Interior to the state television.
The arrested also include a \"media cell\" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote \"the takfiri thought\" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing support and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a planet of the Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when it is two planets that are so similar.
\"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago\"
Police decomisa-Uranium enriched -
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was uranium enriched but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common and current voters record video questions and send them to broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the YouTube Republican party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party towards next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to one subject, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an ‘amnisty’ (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, came to terms with the issue.
No one has the floor to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with the fear of China's toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's latest survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too clever to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, in line with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his warm statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two have come out of the bottom, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early party and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but equally emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influence, nor are they exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor do they suck off-marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party, of over £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister eluded to call an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative slip.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lores, protesting against cuts in military expenditure: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
It is now David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown's walking irrevocably to the exit.
Governments can reach a point of inflection after they are unable to rule.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch assumes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and does not focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although I wanted to disown Tony Blair, she was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions that Brown made as an era chancellor.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blairish's -or -effective for partners - the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The boards aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been defrauded directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't make it.
The laws against anonymity for the major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved until now: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party financing.
This will require a hard cooperative work of Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
The crisis in subprime mortgages is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that dorsal fins are born excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's market for credit cards.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprimes other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million positions in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law on the bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore of morbidity) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts pay consumers every month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is fairly strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for the year 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily drive a change in the creditor capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to advance broadcasters.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortise the mortgage will decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, payment of the card's debt rises in the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid withdrawal of assets.
\"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,\" says Gary Perlin, Capital One Finance Chief.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit push America to recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
These dorsal fins need to be kept under constant scrutiny.
British bankers found guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were on trial for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for collapsing with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were brought to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S district, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, your case marks the outcome of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - the \"NatWest Tres\" doubled - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral of fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew it would value at the top.
A company under the control of Kopper bought the bank interest of the subsidiary in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The British threesome was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed businesses look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension schemes.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with criminal charges last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
\"It has capacity up to 18 passengers,\" says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
-But none of them asks for such a model of seats because it is for private family flights or for presidents of a company -
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonario Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in an event centre near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their display booths, hoping to attract the new Russians trained towards all kinds of products, from kaoba-crafted yachts to diamond-incruted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a brilliant orange Porsche in the neighboring stand of his —
\"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us,\" he said.
\"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft\"
Supplied with fuel by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at peak.
\"We lived the same way in 1890, when some Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,\" says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders.
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think think.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
\"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here,\" says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time next to the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry.
\"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy\"
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costumes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” Yumatova said, “that re-eled off the design suit she used as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the rich new ones, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables to charge, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44,57).
\"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best,\" said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly on a stand of the Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
\"Of course, Russians are more interested in \"bling-bling\"
In fact, the vendors said that Russians who are the richest (10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people — millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists — fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold yarns.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said that the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car grills in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
\"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, does not necessarily drive on those wheels,\" says Mr. Karapetian.
\"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars\"
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase - Russian billionaire - does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of prices of real estate.
\"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash,\" he said.
\"There's more of them than you think\"
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with fake $1 million bill stacks.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake stacks of money, asking their friends to take photos with their cell phones while resting on lots of money, or embroiling a couple of million.
\"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,\" says Karryev.
Surgery - chapuza - could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window, a little healthier, and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car came in.
And then another.
\"Then I saw the ambulance rise,\" said Mr. Livingston, the supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
\"That's when I knew someone had died.\"
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, a helper to the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of 212 West Scott Av.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test even if the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that has been linked to the senior ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my guardian.
She would protect me.
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, leaving two children 14 and 11 years old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
\"That's one of the possibilities,\" Walsh said.
It's an ongoing investigation.
The authorities said that the house arrived about 3 P.M.
On November 21, they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead in the place.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about your research or the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs Castro's house, where a rose rosal was located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled \"vainillin ethyl\" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the coach, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
\"She would say, \"you have to watch over him or him,\" she said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing.
The federal reserve is expected to cut the rates for raising the scholarship
The shares jumped to both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with cuts at interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice-president of the US central bank.
The stock exchanges flourished in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, stated that policy makers must be flexible and pragmatic in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing evidence of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was, in part reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October,
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of his total workforce, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of his investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose to 165.5 points, or 2.7%, when closing to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of the first-order companies in Britain.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3 per cent.
Before, the re-emergence of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month fund auction from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained the credit and loan rates to three months (Libor) between the British banks, meant the highest rise since September, of 6.59 per cent, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes into trial the lawsuits of Owis Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's desk, director of England, is beginning to fill up offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
He who does not get the sixth place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, as trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it just time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or - Tubby - Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to pick up the Captain's eye at the same time as taking a \"wicket\" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But grasping the eye of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who would surely play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself \"fit and bowls\" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class kickets in 33 races for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgirida stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each test and did well in the first, with 5 kickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became an important player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is its brilliant and valuable beginning test of the early 88s in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds facing only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, he seemed to have taken from his \"beating\" something of elan than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He held himself for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to tell him excitedly: \"You saw that.\"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his swing pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left unimpeded, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on an official convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on private transport.
\"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,\" says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
\"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now.\"
\"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people,\" he declares, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cease.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of its bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad, for a grenade attack, after he urged the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
\"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.\"
\"That's why I came back today,\" said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthened groups of concerned citizens armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighbours.
But many declared that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarai, aged 51 and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, whom Nouri al-Maliki, the Shi'ite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian barracks of death.
\"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,\" said the Sunni.
\"I can't believe a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it.\"
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunites have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
\"Last night I explained for the fifth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French,\" that was the ironic motion about themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Sarre that in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called \"Bildungsmonitor\" took the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day students can finish their university career with two or three degrees.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bachelor's degree.
The Sarre is taking advantage of the system of vocational education, says Axel Plünnecke, the expert in the education sector at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people do their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very broad.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialities in Engineering Sciences.
After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools, says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called Kita-Jahr, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of school-development late pupils decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, Sarre did not get much better as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
For the sake of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez gave the time change in the South American country by delaying the half-hour clock.
Chávez is currently staying as a comic in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time will be less than four GMT hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose on its day the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakup of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia because of the action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do so,” says Chavez, who is driving a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which the hostages were released.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: \"Why don't you shut up,\" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to one prediction, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
The experts present a wide range of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
“The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices,” said the newspaper-Bild-Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research Institute.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also correspond to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper, \"Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung\", that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, calling for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices to last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe - Venus Express - discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds on the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For the past three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the street rays of a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal \"Nature\"
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's origin of life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean which, on the other hand, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
Venus is not like this: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution - says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that low temperatures can be reached.
\"Perhaps, Venus is a \"diabolic\" twin from Earth, but it's still a twin,\" Russell said.
The main objective of the mission - Venus Express - is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there had been no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of “Venus Express” in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of \"Nature\" according to researchers' opinion, highlight not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had supposed to have,” says ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called the star of dawn or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble the Earth very much, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water on the Earth remained in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's myth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end the fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
\"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,\" Koehler said to the newspaper \"Handelsblatt.\"
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Even though I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute relevance to me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received when he made a new policy with China.
The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional Una China policy course.
China also knows that - Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his dislike for the reception of Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by the members of the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship caused major misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democrat Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine, Spiegel, froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those in France.
Battles with police on the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
The vandals were barricaded, shot with rifles at the police: after severe riots by young people in France, Federal Minister of Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) feared similar trends in Germany.
\"We need to see that the social problems in our country do not take the violent form.\"
\"That's what we have to take seriously,\" he said in the newspaper \"Neue Presse\" published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop into the constant change in social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That is not only about the integration of immigrants.
From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing fruit.
It's still early to sit the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people played serious riots in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
More vocational training posts need to be taken care of.
Kolat underlines: “We need to give young people a perspective”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France - there is great social control in families - greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat thinks: \"But in spite of everything, we have to be careful\"
Youth need to be given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training job faster than possible.
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel happened peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burnt cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1000 police officers has been in charge of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On Monday night to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that nothing more needs to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After his desperate, indifferent and contentless performance in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
With regard to the reproach that was made to him for his repeated dedication to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptuous sentence.
He said that this would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower Chamber, it was very clear to everyone that that reproach was appropriate.
One could not feel any interest or feeling at all about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: much was praised for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Union has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he's going through expressions to get people to drive.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It began to stumble - as if it had been in an unknown territory - when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican presidential pre-candidates on YouTube and must now fear only one candidate on the outside.
Tensions between candidates are already noted from the beginning.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York a shelter for illegal immigrants.
This, for his part, responded with serious rebukes: \"I would like to say that his own house was a \"porter\" for the illegals - Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
\"With this way of isolation, we let Hitler come to power,\" said John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on withdrawing the troops from Iraq immediately.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to acknowledge as torture the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown his death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg Hall in Florida show that in the meantime the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” explains Romney, “and he apologizes to the people and the television audience for having been a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took an oath as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan ends.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of 5 years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after power was done with an incrucent military coup, the former general ruled for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath, is going to cancel the state of emergency very soon and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many advocates of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
According to information from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the Afghanistan border.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows its activity: three members of \"Harmonia\" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a retreat, a copy of \"Live 1974\" was made, which was written in the best era of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band was making music again.
What needs to be rebelled here is this: the accurate questions have shown that the name of the band was resounding in people's minds, but it was not something as special as for the public to miss it so much after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music prize (Echo) to members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for their work of life, the faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent his time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I didn't achieve a great effect on the public, however, I obtained it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th century ruin, they lived as city refugees.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an association banner of Ottenstein's Song Harmony appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called \"Musik von Harmonia\" and the second \"De Lux\"
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know oneself.
The CD-Live 1974 was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel harmony and to do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up involved in esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as \"Flamende Herzen\"
Cluster revived the eighties and since then has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that has to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the manual (Krautrock Sampler)
There is also the present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: \"This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.\"
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where you see instruments with cables.
In the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus that they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment it is coughed, whispered and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung \"Aaaaaaah.\"
Krautrock was always an English term.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever yells here -68 - is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage you think very well about what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
That can break your nerves or give you a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films - The Hunting Party - and -Morderischer Frieden - are once again engaged in the war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his \"The Hunting Party\" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark inside of the country during the Bosnian war, was discovered again the actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man in the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women's movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film - The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues - (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and messy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the cinema hadn't been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, that as a monument to the ruin of his decadence he had preserved so far most of his charm.
‘The Hunting Party’, in spite of this triumph, together with ‘Morderischer Frieden’, which is German production and will also be presented this week, turned out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can tell the film \"Morderischer Frieden\" in short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series (Alarm is Cobra 11) without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of The Hunting Party, you can investigate, because there was actually never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script writer (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called the \"sorro\" could probably be a new \"Apocalypse Now\"
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of The Hunting Party is when at first they introduce Simon Hunt, to him who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim bosnia that will then kill.
Then - The Hunting Party - is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters could not achieve for five years, who went to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to avenge themselves in a just way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to head a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: \"In the big wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, that hard is to be bad\"
In films like - The Hunting Party - there are also these demons but they prove that hard is to be good.
The problem is not only the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star goes through a crisis region or the minefields, then something like this appears like \"Rangoon\" with Patricia Arguette, \"On the other side of all borders\" with Angelina Jolie or \"Diamantes sangantes\" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a brief space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood makes a good movie about the holocaust with the example of the film \"The Schindler List\"
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the war works in Vietnam - The Deer Hunter - -Apocalypse Now - or -Full Metal Jackett - were not held unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time each massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary to be able to tell good stories.
“Being or not to be” or “The great dictator” turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that such a bad thing was actually the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps it must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his historical novel - Dictionary of Lemprière - and the war in the Balkans, he replied: \"That's just because some things never change\"
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympics in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that one must be realistic in estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed on Wednesday this resignation as -not good for economic emplacement -
In recent times no other project in the big city encouraged as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympics.
\"Without this goal, political momentum could not be maintained, sport at the same level\"
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new, long-term, time-bound application.
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics would not take place until at least 2028.
\"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympics, but decides on it by the German Olympic Sports Federation,\" says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
\"This preference means to us that in this period of time, we thought we had until now until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance\"
Despite everything, this dream didn't end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
“It’s too soon to let the opportunity go, if the plans are ruined at this time,” said Günter Ploß, HSB’s director.
A resignation of the application is in contradiction with the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception at the general meeting of the German Public Federation for the sport of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as a replacement for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week did the Federation of Sports of Higher Schools appoint Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party's Fraction (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) rebuked the Senate not to take the time so valuable for building houses in Hamburg.
\"For many years, the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighbourhood of Grassbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses,\" said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympic planning for small Grassbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics provoked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed the cause of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Those who relate the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety and four ‘type’ X-rays on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper \"Expresse\" questioned the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet de Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six-Brillo-Boxes, which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred others of \"Stocolmo type\" who are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first - Brillo-Boxes - painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that had soap powder cartons - Brillo -
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Museum Modern Museet were exposed hundreds of carton boxes. These did not make them Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of \"Brillo\"
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production in Sweden of wooden brillo-boxes, but were not exhibited at the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the art history and auction as originals of the \"Brillo-Boxes\" of \"Stocolmo type\" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hulten Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First, they printed and stacked their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the squeezed silvers. Besides, it is not oil painting, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brillo-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the \"Andy Warhol Art\" Authentication Commission does not reach any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exhibition.”
Already in Julio The Authentication Commission has formally announced that it accepts these - serious charges - in which it is soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had crawled into a hotel in Manila have surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that she could not answer for shedding blood.
The soldiers faithful to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on Thursday's trial for attempting a coup in 2003 which ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly deposit himself with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police who were to watch him had moved on to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel - Peninsula - and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councilman, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are sick,” Trillanes said.
\"We've summoned people to our ranks.\"
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite troop Scout Reangers, said that in a short time the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday to a great demonstration against the president.
His government has been reproaching corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at coups against the elected government in a democratic way.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versailles.
United Internet ensured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options to increase the financial part further in Versailles.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to speed up the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday they already made the assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased their participation to the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third party.
United Internet already on the previous day involved almost 10 percent of the telecom company Drillisch.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million to the extent of capital expansion.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros from them.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL-products.
\"We strengthen our collaboration,\" said the spokesperson for the United Internet.
The two companies founded a MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday the United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent to Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., they take part in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all the options, especially participation in Freenet anonymous society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This - game - with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market in Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch will get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
