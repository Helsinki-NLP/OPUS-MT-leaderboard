Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned with \"passing for puppets\"
Gallois elected members are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railing.
An elected worker said that his group is concerned that the phrase “shrinks with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crust.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Parti du Pays de Galles) is not \"satisfied\" and has proposed other forms.
The Conservative party would be \"open\" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionne), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, stated that \"the final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly belongs to them\".
The Government of Wales Act 2007 (Government of Wales Act 2017) gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the House as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is working in favour of members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the modification of the country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday if their country is now to be called the \"Republic of Northern Macedonia\".
People's vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a contentious age of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take account of the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that name change is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
\"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street,\" says Mr. Adams.
\"There is no more of it today.\"
According to him, it's normal that the bars have gotten cold.
Today, \"we don't get in the same way anymore,\" he explains.
\"We used to go to the bar like his neighbor, but that's not the case anymore.\"
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before the leaders imagine that they are concerned: \" sooner or later, they will return to the departure box.\"
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
\"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly white people who will rush the closure of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them,\" he says.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist Congregation abandoned the scene in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was resumed by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks were meant to be used or to obtain a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners prepared to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the \"peaks of the poor.\"
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: \"a cultural treasure\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument\".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, it has been a question of how architects and entrepreneurs moved, caused by the lay elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wished to impose the costs incurred, although it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old wounded by a shark in a lobster fishery
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old last Saturday while he was fishing in the lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went to pay for it to get out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out joyfully for having had a shot, and then he realized that in reality he was
He was bitten.
Upon arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
\"I was yelling so everyone could get out of the water: there's a shark!\" Chad said.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a press conference, the Chief Supporter Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the access of the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered as non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetic market
Sansbury's is low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and provides them with rays similar to supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while fashion and home sales are falling, more beautiful products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the market of beauty in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sansbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second scheduled to open in the course of the year at Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to grow their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and head to local shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, stated that sales points will increasingly resemble large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel sales of current consumer goods and to make acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetic beams had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted partnership with Boots, but he ended up having a controversy about the distribution of the benefits from the pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
It was after having sold its 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds sterling in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was supposed to play a role in introducing in 4 shops a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty products has been modified to improve the customer framework.
\"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the embellishment of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputable and changes the buying habits,\" said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from an agreement of £11 million
Curroux of the star of the television program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the animated Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million tied to his home decoration brand, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrow.
Aged 37, This Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, furious by withdrawing from their successful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the darling child on TV revealed, at a meeting that was held under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of the Dragon's Den Star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, at the height of 1.5 million pounds, no longer allowed him to deal with Truly, their interior decoration and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of the actress Gwyneth Ptrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the fortune of the performer estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, \" Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and is now securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to be sold.\"
Specialists believe that the departure of this Morning's animator, who is among Britain's most \"bankable\" celebrities, could cause millions to lose to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or indoor items, and the risk of delayed launch.
Furthermore, this could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take over Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A close source of Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was burning, but finally we love each other.
Trump mocked the media who criticized him because of his comment that some consider him \" unworthy of a president\", and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
\"Why has President Trump given up so much?\"
he took a voice as a TV journalist.
\"I have not given up at all.\"
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump had qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, from a large step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at an early stage.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that there was no \"corresponding response\" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump rally speech, he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
\"Everything goes well with North Korea,\" says North American President.
We broke the armed conflict.
\"Millions of people were reportedly killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.\"
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting trials, the release of hostages and remnants of North American military to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
\"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people who try to access this arena full of cracking, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me,\" he shouted, pointing a finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok was scattered, but no state of national disaster had been declared, a condition required for the triggering of international aid.
\"Unfortunately, they have repeatedly clearly stated that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a little complicated,\" she regretted.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if the field work will be allowed.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shocks he faced, the country lacked cruel means of sheltering itself from the whims of nature.
Some shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have been found in Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the reform of the damaged infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable money on rehabilitating roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, which was called to stand before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state was also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practiced their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been hunted out of their homes, based on clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking at 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was conducted from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot into the second pole.
The ball flew above the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ended up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its road at the bottom of the cage.
\"I was just trying to place myself, to take the ball, but players like Shaq always get as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,\" says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.\"
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in the mid-time after a goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues carved a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before cruising into the middle of the field and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic realizes a rapid and winding in the middle of the field,
then he made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard outruns the defense and ends his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the porter of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League at 3:00 this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of tsunami victims is 832
The disaster management agency indicated on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance sheet reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the wreckage of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was planted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's corpse was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 0755, the 44-year-old woman who was beaten with knives was discovered on John's Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to deliver their testimony.
The police captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: \"The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In particular, I call taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their Dashcam and asked them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.\"
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police indicated that it informed the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
One police officer entrusted that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
by repeating, \"It's too horrible.\"
At 2 p.m., two police vans were placed inside the cord, and another outside.
Several officers monitored the building on the inner side of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call the 101 or to contact the failure-to-crime organization anonymously at 0800 555 111, as indicated in Register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in the light of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society judges Mr. Crick's proposal \"unreasonable\" and described him as \"revisionist attempt\".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that \" given the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's standing before the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted the iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
Cromwell's superb representation, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate.\"
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated.\"
China: A Pig Kills A Liver · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a piggy on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pigs vaccines into a pig's cannery on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a neighbor's porch door was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside it and blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutilated the herder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the husband's cousin, said that \"his legs were sprayed and covered with blood.\"
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arrived on the market at 04h40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that led to Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market manager entrusted to the Evening News that the animal was locked to avoid any other incident and allow police officers to collect evidence.
The family of the herder Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a wife and her husband, seriously hurting him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh herder on its tractor before his wife managed to get away from it.
In 2012, when an Oregon herder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood could cause this type of behavior.
\"They are rather gamblers animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of harming you.
Just show them the respect they owe them,\" he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa should cause severe precipitation in the south-eastern United States
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it moves above the coldest waters on the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause attacks in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Winds were at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m., Eastern Sunday time, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression begins to rise above the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Basse-Californie Peninsula on Monday in the form of storm, Hurricane Rosa will result in intense tropical humidity to the North, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden, dangerous spills of debris and potential landslides in the desert.
The averses will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per location, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, including a large part of Arizona.
Dissemination of tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into drawn rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind flashes and dust turbines per location.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some southern regions of the country, on the Californian coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low castings of debris and make the pavement slippery.
These could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Disperse tropical earthquakes will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitations will fall to the four corners of the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the centre and east of the United States should have a warm beginning of October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the south plains and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Forecasts over several days indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television stations on Thursday, the seizures of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting him in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a shooting: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to investigate charges for a week.
In front of the Senate's Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had given birth to her person and had tried to take off her clothes at a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate fashion, also claimed to be 100% certain that it never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on the audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest didn't weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
\"Don't look elsewhere, look at me,\" one of the women says.
\"Do you really believe that he is telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor.\"
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast network channels covered the live session a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake partly became convinced by arguing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the accusations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making \"small politics\"
In an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making \"small politics\" to the detriment of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a cover photo of Theresa May, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Great Britain and the European Union was \"alright ridiculous\".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect from the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was raped and charged with second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the legal physician of the parish of Baton-Rouge published Friday a preliminary report, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for their \"commitment and quest for justice\".
Sims was only 20.
1,98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per game during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach said the team was \"stricken and shocked\" after the news of Wayde's death.
\"We constantly replay this kind of event,\" said Wade.
Mexico : a volcano cracks ashes
From the ashes escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several storms and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalunya: clashes between police and separatists on the approach to the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not decompose tourists.
Warmlings also broke out later in the day, while the police used bats to contain clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that ran \"no forget, no forgiveness,\" faced unionist supporters who shouted \"long life in Spain\".
14 protesters who had minor injuries were treated according to the local press.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions are still strong in the independentist region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, opponents of secession having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It had the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
\"We witnessed last year at a great time.
My parents wept for joy at the thought of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse,\" he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although weak, in the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had difficulty keeping up this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for having organized the referendum and declared Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, found that politicians were responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
\"Treasurableness only increases,\" he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to submit his application to the European Parliament elections next year.
\"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,\" he adds.
Londonderry Arrest : Men Perk a House By Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after having sunk several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19.30 local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins match 1 to 0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures the victory of Livingston
Recently raised to rank, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox club coach.
Menga's goal made the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in the second position of the ranking, equally with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside Premiership's league this season, and must face the Hearts team, which leads to 8 points on Sunday.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europe League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she has been pursuing 6 games in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be horrified that she has not yet lost the slightest encounter.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face rioting opponents
Holt's team could have gone ahead long before they scored, because their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to get lost but remained locked in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass of Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that they could be embarrassed by working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal comes from.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined Menga, who took a hit and scored a goal from the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely just worried.
The second half-time knew the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos had forced a Kelly arrest.
The Allan McGregor Ranger stopped Scott Pittman's foot, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Guard of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of hand.
The Livingston phenomenon - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A wifey performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to surpass expectations on this rising slope.
Their style and composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the top, but the merit largely returns to Holt for having since his motivated arrival a team
with many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga knew how to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in haleine throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and managed to break the side of the side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the picture.
Mixed house of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Turkish Germans and qualified as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies as a result of a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on the spot, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The automobile driver had fled.
The London police stated that the officers were doing everything to identify the individual and prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in a riot
The prison manager for high-security men stated that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The riot started in HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 0930 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-emute officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the officers were treated for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the management of the prison said: \"Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their prolonged sentences.\"
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officers were sent to the prison to prevent serious disruption: prisoners had attacked the personnel with billiard balls.
Oragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to touch Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of her energy. This region could be affected by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcer rains on Monday night.
The Phoenix-based national weather service stated in a tweet that \"only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm within a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border.\"
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide for 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert including the central area of the Rockies and the Great Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be life-saving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to sudden raw risks.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40 per cent of Arizona knew at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category,\" reportsweather.com.
The Rosa hurricane begins its way on the shores, in the Basse-Californie Peninsula.
Always of great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa has been located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
\"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,\" saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona on Tuesday, early morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
\"River rains are expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and south-west desert and constitute the main danger,\" said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitation will result in potentially deadly sudden floods and debris spills in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday about 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset reported having arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
Agents have appealed to people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of evil and the anger of the Democrats
\"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that \"the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage\" today.
\"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service,\" he explained to the partisans gathered in Virginia-Western.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
\"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever,\" he said.
\"That's why I fight all fronts for formidable candidates.\"
Trump stated that the Democrats were on the mission of \"resistance and obstruction\".
The first decisive vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's appointment should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a collaborator of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: a earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet is constantly rising
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them taken by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
\"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami didn't come alone. It drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,\" Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at the speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Replica continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have widened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Corps were found trapped under the debris of ruined buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still reported missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more significant over 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications were \"completely paralyzed\" since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,\" said La Croix Rouge in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
\"The situation is dramatic and may well get worse,\" she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not having broadcast the information that a tsunami had affected Palu, although agents had stated that waves had arrived as long as the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming freneticly to passersby on the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to deliver aid by planes-cargos from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who are evacuated still have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has reopened as relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: There are more than 800 deaths in the tsunami population.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely and excepted in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba explains.
\"They told me they saw many houses destroyed,\" he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to bring relief to the disaster, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
\"This disaster is still considered regional,\" says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.\"
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi.
\"As an elder in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas,\" he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages from WhatsApp to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
\"I think they never received my messages.\"
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when recharging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have noticed many suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Yes
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"Anciently known as Kanye West.\"
Age 41, West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for \"emotional reasons,\" explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation for his current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
\"I think \"Ye\" is the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means \"you,\" explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
\"Then I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means \"the only\", to Ye - it reflects the good, the evil, the confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.\"
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the character of union and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
The President of Mexico elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody repression by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to punish the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a peaceful event, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of opportunities for education motivates young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the artificial intelligence investor Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the AI innovation leader by 2030.
\"Dubling the funding for research in the IIA field would be a good start, as all other countries have a length of advance on the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in AI,\" says Lee.
Folding the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the best ranking American player Othello. He then joined the management team of Microsoft Research and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
\"It's not China that gets the academic leaders, it's the companies,\" says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the United States' AI efforts.
\"I think green cards should automatically be given to researchers in AI,\" he says.
China's Council for State Affairs unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,\" Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academie partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year for research in the AI.
In parallel, the US legislation that has been working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia voiced their voice at a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a right in its territory and opposed its veto at its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Slav population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a 50% minimum participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: \"Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?\"
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which have been saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
\"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us,\" Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, said Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of the parliament stated that they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16 per cent, while it reached 34 per cent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which mobilized 66 per cent of the voters registered at the end of the poll.
\"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,\" says Gjoise Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open their voice to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
\"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door,\" Kavadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.\"
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments, with the unemployment rate in the country exceeding 20%.
\"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,\" said Mr. Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a \"yes\" would be a \"confirmation of our future\".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would have intended to participate in the referendum, which is less than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote \"yes\".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to pro-west government policy since its takeover in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, takes a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinian drummer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before he went to the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green hats.
He circled one of the defenders before evicting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English foreman took advantage of returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guard, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
\"Aguero has some problems with his feet,\" said Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to journalists.
\"We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance that he scored at the time.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Skyblues at the First League game,
in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second post.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play ball-feasts against the Rockies
The Nationals team being eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play on Sunday against the Rockies of Colorado, but only in case of a play-off for the Rockies, of real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West National League division.
The Rockies took it 5-2 to the Nationals Friday night, but they still seek to secure their first division title.
\"Although this game has no stake, we want to crowd the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?\"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the seat in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington royalty is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on take in 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that had generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
\"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight all fronts for formidable candidates,\" he said.
Trump went on \"You see this horrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care who they hurt, whom they crush to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we will not give them.\"
Democrats are on the mission of \"resistance and obstruction\".
\"You can see it over the last four days,\" he added, before qualifying the democrats of people \"in anger, wicked and lying.\"
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which made him want to be hated by the public.
\"Do you remember his answer?\"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant to those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party parliamentarians who are considered not to be welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has received an identical treatment because she has risen up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are issues for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the gathering of the Nottingham East Labour Friday said: \"We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive.\"
That's exactly what the general assemblies on Friday night were for my eight years as Labour Party Parliamentary.
Unfortunately, today it is not the case of many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten if it has ever been taken into account.
It became clear that the opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought to share a similar political vision began waiting for me to return my jacket and to take positions against my convictions, whether it be about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive social media shooting, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In addition, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a wide range of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about the current policy is the standardization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted by the motions of defiance and the amendments to the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so strong, and everything would go well.
But it is not to act that way that I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local advisor or a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could not be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it is not really time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invasive
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt on it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the Scots Championship from rugby to XV.
The team now holds the top of the ranking and becomes the only invading team of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this game.
\"So far, we have been tested, but we remain incapacitated, so I must think happy!\" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: \"They have been more effective than we and have been able to seize the opportunities.\"
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish frame Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the figures spoken. Jason Baggot took on an unprocessed trial.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, just in the middle of the day. He scored and turned a solo test to set the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
He followed a long wait because of a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a circus. During the recovery, Ayr resumed the front with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed Bruce Colvine test, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team took their hands off and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to have clicked on Climo while he did not have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kickbox and sent the Gregor Henry ally away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game Star launches in the Restoration
Ford Kieran, Still Game's star, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man embodies Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he writes and coanimizes with his long-standing stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun had revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the \"flowering environment of restoration\" in Glasgow.
\"The sea is ours\": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a armoured boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings are flying a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases display the following bike: \"The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty.\"
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is always well present. Just like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so tangible for several decades. Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
\"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result,\" explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will speak in favour of Bolivian application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be rendered Monday.
\"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,\" he declared late August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will pronounce itself in favor of Chile, and that few things will change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have caused harm to her.
\"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,\" said Zárate.
The bellicose rhetoric of Morales knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring to Bolivia \"an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile\" and a chance to \"end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,\" he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bet.
\"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,\" he added.
\"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past.\"
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri states that it is \"chemical\" to believe that the continuation of the United States' sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will bring the North to an end.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious decision to abandon an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in cover-heads, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect you from the sun to 100%, don't look anymore.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversized delusional hats during a PE19 parade that honoured the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
All the more extravagant hats that the others have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to integrate their play into the parades.
Valentino's lightpiece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge that evoked a feather, which swallowed the heads of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included pastries made of jewelry, a sorcier hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the lips peeled and mentioned more Hannibal Lecter than the Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like a dive equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another made the thought of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to the style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the wake of the \"Bomba\", the straw hat on board wide that the stars take off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this difficult portable hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the swimsuit mannequin that wore it.
The orange raffia bag burned, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrities designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: \"I expect to see the large chapels and beach bags arrive in the shops for the next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is evident that there will be demand for oversized accessories.\"
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and in place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing an on-the-spot school curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak in his heart.\"
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relations and establish a link of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of the reviews this year, it is found that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade, A.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest grade, A, Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Nowadays, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission carried out in 2014 shows that 17% of the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not have enough foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will benefit from better opportunities to find rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on traditional contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important to the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialized staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what their future reserve.
It is clear that languages in a global trading environment today remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James's debut at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
\"More than one, less than 48\" said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
The Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few short minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
\"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready.\"
Trump's Campaign in Virginia-Western (Stouch Chain)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court was postponed, and Trump sought support for the forthcoming mid-term elections and prevented Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia this evening and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (Est hour) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the issue of candidates' hearings at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims first of all to help Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at \"encouraging volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\"
\"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will be in as many states as possible at the beginning of the campaign in charge,\" said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention from Pittsburgh.\"
Saturday, this will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by over 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Senate of Virginia-Western, who is outraged in the polls.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to re-launch him in the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, Political Science Specialist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope close to Sunday's simples
After three simple ones, Saturday afternoon ovens could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The balance movement of the momentum is an invented sports concept of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
\"They were leading six points ahead and now four, so it gives us some wings,\" Jordan Spieth said as he went back for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling that they have a little wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can stutter at getting three out of four points each.
Spieth proved to be terribly effective from green tea and set the example.
The cry of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and was brought down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, gave rise to a similar cry, from those who tell you that he still believes the American team in high school.
\"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,\" said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair won four matches on four and is not entitled to error.
Not only were \"Moliwood\" the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the players to fight Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to bring back a potential European victory while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably both at the same time to different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, an early forball hero, while he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine hits sent the Spanish and Swedish to a hole they could never find out.
On the other hand, on Sunday no one is here to help you.
The forballs and forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the ones they do not give, and the way a strategy can slip into a blink of an eye.
Europe has played a better team to date and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during the Saturday forballs and forsomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Well determined to keep the title she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning furballs in front of a disordered American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the furnaces and won two victories, but they have failed to solve the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must pick up eight points on 12 Sundays when they are simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points in a row, while Molinari and Molliwood, named after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points in their first four matches.
After overcrowding Woods and Patrick Reed in the forballs, the pair of American beginners Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and 4 more categorical.
Woods, who sled during the two matches on Saturday, shone a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes matches, and seven wings.
Justin Rose, well-retired for the morning furballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, winning 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, under a cool but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furnaces and again beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in the furnaces, which had lost the first two holes.
Twice only in Ryder Cup's history, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although the Furyk team, who held the crown, had only to make a null match to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not give themselves over to a Sunday attack.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no case “be possible” unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions was reinforcing his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to renounce unilaterally its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that last year North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will”, such as ending such as the cessation of nuclear tests and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to further nuclear weapons and technology
\"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States,\" he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally.\"
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticisms of Washington's opposition to a \"step-by-step\" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it was taking steps progressively, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done so in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to work for a \"denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and emphasizes pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the “declaration of end-of-war”.
\"Those who think that these sanctions can make us pray do not know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our distrust.\"
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings that took place between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: \"If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse.\"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had declared before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump's \"malefic\" named Kim \"missile man\" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year before the United Nations to \" completely destroy\" North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim has applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
Wednesday, Trump stated that no deadline had been set. \"It may take two years, three years or five months; it has no significance,\" he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: \"The application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization.\"
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took \"equivalent measures\".
He said South Korean President Kim called for the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight against the growing machist trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most students at the best university in the world can't take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of the kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, \"Why do you tell me this only in the last year?\"
She claimed that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
\"We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health,\" added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of \"a white night\" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make sleeplessness a growing problem.
Having adequate sleep and good quality should be the \"secret weapon\" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a way of inanitation, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that he be offered to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar study program before joining the well-known institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm both for bedtime and for awakening, and be aware of the harmful effects of the \"blue light\" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause numbness disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal drops Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticular team to Livingston's defeat of 1-0.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first trip victory since his 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerard his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind the Hearts, leader of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs into third position, right behind Hibernian on the difference in goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a spot at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every time.
The Rangers may have mastered the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield dropped his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the Frankish coup when Steven Lawless and joined him in a collision, but Archbishop Steven Thomson deviated from Colombia's demands.
The Rangers only took advantage of two first-time shots, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute has registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it from their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted to the mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange was likely to have an immediate impact when the wing appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has also continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs away before Lithgow went past the goal.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was at the scene with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The Geiger counter inventor
And now, a page from our Almanach \"Sunday Morning\": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm \"Hans\" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film \" Bells of Coronado\", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: \"What is that?\"
Rogers: \"It's a Geiger counter, we use it to search for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Through these listeners, we can really hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.\"
Evans: \"Tell me, it's for sure that it jumps in there!\"
\"Hans\" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to \"detect\" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to \"detect\" cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into a laboratory
They can then \"detect\" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into a laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland said, \"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein \"leads to increase several types of cancer\", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which consists of taking immune cells to \"learn\" to target cancer cells, has been shown in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
A MAGA headphone, Kanye West launched into a Pro-Trump diatribe after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was hounded on the plateau after a staging performance during which he praised American President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to be in the elections in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again helmet, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"Many times, I talk to white people and they say, \"How can you love Trump? He's racist!\"
\"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time,\" he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe registration was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his helmet.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a guuffre,\" he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"Do you want to see him, the gouffer?\" and claims that he would wear his superman's cap, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love.\"
His comments attracted him to hooves at least twice by the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person on the spot said to the magazine, \"A silence of death fell on the whole plateau.\"
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarrayed many people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of Conservative leader Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: \"To one of the most courageous spirits: WOMAN'S WOMAN'S WOMAN'S WOMAN.\"
But Karen Hunter, the animator of the show, tweeted that West was simply \"faithful to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful.\"
\"However, I choose not to reward someone (buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and reverses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we,\" she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now \"officially known as Kanye West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the traces of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and, of course, the legendary Prince Fire, which changed its name to symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of Attempt to Kill After Aggression to White Gun in a Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast Trial Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often causes young boys to become hard to cook for themselves.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he believes \"something is wrong\" and addresses the question of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covedette of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he was \"holding firm\" to address this issue.
\"Personally, I think deeply that we have damaged masculinity.\"
\"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults about the problem that now arises?\"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: \"What behaviour is triggered, what behaviour has been instilled?
What does television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they should behave like that to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something that's wrong.\"
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or follow-up when the series ends next summer, claiming to have ended with \"the battlefields and horses\".
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a recovery from True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that had come to him in Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now,\" he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent in its population with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, stated the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies suggest that 70% to 90% of homosexuals end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters admits that a GOP employee has disclosed information about senators and denounces \"dangerous lies\" and \"compound theories\".
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information regarding three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and \"extreme-right\" websites.
\"Thousands, lies, and evil lies,\" Waters responded in a Twitter statement.
It seems that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie. ”
\"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no case responsible for the leaking of this information.\"
\"This fallacy allegation is completely false and a true lie.\"
Waters' statement quickly gave rise to online criticisms, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
\"This denial is anger,\" he wrote.
\"This indicates that she does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something that he or she has not done, he or she must not be angry.
She must not be provocative.
She must not question the defendant's motives.
She must remain calm and serene.\"
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being overly angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
\"If it's true, it's huge,\" he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted \"the authorities and departments responsible for the enforcement of the relevant laws\" about these fraudulent claims.
\"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,\" she added, \"and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for all my team members.\"
Johnny English still hit. Rowan Atkinson's parody, under-witted spy
It has now become a tradition to search the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the Johnny English action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfying on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with his scarred eyes and rubber face, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name first of all indicating that it is a great comical creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his questionable attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that executes a small note in The Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the international traveller and mystery man Atkinson once played in the television commercials Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English getting closer to a helicopter while he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades struck briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although the mood is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at the time when \"serious\" licenses such as 007 and Mission cannot compose themselves with confidence with the comedy.
The mood seems more oriented towards children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's gossip adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
Britain is still facing serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British spies' super-secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of the agents in service - a rare, low-profile role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that blows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this near-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisors inform him that every active spy who has been compromised will have to bring someone out of his retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons about how to become a secret agent: a few nice farces here, because English offers a spy academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create a major trouble with Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological billionaire charisma that says he is capable of solving the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough throw their odyssey of gossip: under the disguise of waiters, they set the fire to a sparkling French restaurant; they create a chaos by flapping on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when it tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are secured for this last sequence, but nevertheless, there are not bad things for the children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help thinking, as for the other movies of Johnny English: can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day's leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source within the Labour Party said in the Sunday Times: \"It is planned that a policy review be announced before the end of the year.\"
\"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers and with its global industrial strategy.\"
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"A four-day working week does not constitute a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.\"
John McDonnell's alternate chancellor took advantage of last week's working conference to give details about his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take over power in the hands of the \"anonymous administrators\" and \"profiters\" in public utility companies.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their delivery as the labour government may operate \"deductions\" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, which will amount to up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on \"60 Minutes\" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least one week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings might encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60-minute program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"Of course,\" Kennedy said.
\"As I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, \"Did you do that?\"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocally resolved.\"
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved on the stone.
\"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there should be an explosive charge,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's an old 36-year-old affair.
I can't see anything new that changes.\"
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palmares and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people turn to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or \"actions\", such as volunteering, e-mail a world leader, telephone or do any other useful effort in order to raise the public's awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allows them to persuade them to demand an appeal for action, or is it just another example of \"clicking\" - a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million \"actions\" from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to \"help children develop their full potential\", while promising to Rwanda assistance of £35 million to end malnutrition in this country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
\"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,\" said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the company's more than 5,000 actions to ask the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, \"what makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?\"
Global Citizen said: \"The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will get there, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will encourage the show.
The United States could appeal to the Navy to create a \"block\" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary to the Interior
In order to avoid Russian energy reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can \"if necessary\" appeal to the U.S. Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I believe they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe,\" he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this situation.
\"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct in order to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,\" he added.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the \"Energy Consumer spokesperson\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
\"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the operation and replacement of fuels,\" he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has \"more than a rope to its arc\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to stimulating the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration representatives, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the \"inappropriate\" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin \"prisoner\" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, \"I think we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.\"
The position of the United States led to negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of attending the 2020 presidential elections, says the senator from Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself.
\"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the top,\" says The Hill.
\"After November 6, I will seriously consider presenting my application to the Presidents.\"
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, claiming that he \"led this country in the wrong direction.\"
\"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,\" she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said, \"Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.\"
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electors are not of the opinion that it is expected to appear in 2020.
According to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe, 58% of the \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38 per cent in favour of a potential campaign and 48 per cent against it.
Other names of highly targeted Democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 include those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after her enlistment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
\"What my own son is experiencing today, what he feels when he returns, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers return,\" she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as \"the subject taboo\" and said about his son and other veterans that \"they come a little different, hard-won, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air forces, and each other military, gave to the country.\"
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the District filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seeker who was contesting this policy, said NBC News.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner \"and her sons, members of violent gangs,\" had assaulted her, but the U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a decision by the Immigration Appeal Board in 2014, which authorized illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy \"is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law\".
\"The Federal Act states that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,\" said Amicus Curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants night to the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and \"provide the necessary work\".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
\"Assyle is granted to persons leaving their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,\" said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of the said policy.
\"Assyle has never been designed to mitigate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world.\"
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
\"I feel very tense,\" said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fief little boy in Palu, in a fenced city evacuation center.
\"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.\"
Residents were seen going to their destroyed houses, collecting detached property, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of severe persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
\"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe,\" Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
\"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to my child.
I hope they're safe.\"
The United States ambassador accuses China of \"intimidation\" by means of \"propaganda advertisements\"
A week after a official Chinese newspaper passed a four-page advertisement boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to immigrate itself in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, a charge that China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to get involved in the US elections, Trump noted that U.S. officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign conducted by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at striking state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had done harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the Sunday Register of Mills, \"is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.\"
\"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,\" writes Branstad.
\"On the other hand, in Beijing's press window, you will find few questionable voices and will not see the true reflection of the diverging views that Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist party,\" he writes.
He added that \"one of the most important newspapers in China has avoided publishing\" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating voters to the approach of mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said \"we can't go back.\"
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the voter's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National spokesperson for the MoveOn Progressive Group, \"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,\" she said on 28 September according to the Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mich reports, the protesters sang \"November month arrives!\" in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans ruling the Judicial Committee chose to move forward the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
\"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overpowered,\" said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
\"People say it's already up, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote.\"
Even before Ford's public deposition explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's appointed, analysts suggested that the reaction would be life-threatening if Republicans were to advance confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that \"It became a confusing disorder for the GOP.\"
\"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also about how the Republicans have managed the situation and the way they have treated it,\" said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats, on the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority of them tending on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably Ford's testimony, while 35% claimed to believe absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations advanced by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied at Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitalia during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a whole new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as individuals allowed to access such information or information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said jokingly that Inrupt intended to \"lord the world\".
\"We must do it now,\" he said about the launch.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own \"on-line personal data store\" or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in one browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this \"personal liability through data\".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he are not yet in discussion with \" Facebook and Google\" to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely framed in an instant.
\"We don't ask for permission.\"
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the \"mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid\".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an Ecclesiastical of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said he was \"brightly symbolic\" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal \"through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of campaign cannons and machine guns.\"
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the \"greatest bravery\", led the line before jumping a campaign cannon to himself and seizing three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were \"one thing to which I will never be, but which makes me humble.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt \"very honored to be part of the parade\" and added that \"the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be given him by many people.\"
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event included 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the viewers of the United Kingdom were sided when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until the early morning hours, especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to cartoon for children as \"a kind of bad joke\".
Regarding transmission, the leading vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that \"the government regulation provides that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to the children's show.\"
“Peppa the pig — yes. ”
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator Company, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
\"I think that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution,\" Coker said.
\"However, it's six o'clock in the morning a Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have wasted everything.
It is a sad situation.\"
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"lower\" in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before going to high school that \"everyone [was] not like me.\"
As part of the first broadcast by Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to give others \"hope\".
He also said that the fact that he became a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took a leave of several months because of her illness.
As a wreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt \"less than\" all the other children growing up because \"it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.\"
He said, \"Now these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and the strength needed for my success.\"
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was \"something,\" he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of this year's participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to ask a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give \"hope\" to others.
The three-time world champion claimed that he \"did not expect\" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old elder winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
\"When we saw so many things at such a young age\" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same high and low.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that \"all his perspective\" had changed.
\"If you asked me last year, I only thought I'd win a gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.\"
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they had already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him, \"Dad, you won't be there to be in the first row,\" he said.
\"I held him by hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and be killed so that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,\" he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
\"That was all I had dreamed of all my life - to plunge in front of a crowd at home at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better,\" he said.
In addition, this inspired her first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - who had accompanied her in preparations for the Olympics and always gave her the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m., BST.
An out-of-form Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was removed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the great fivefold champion shared his day between the role of supporting and polishing his game to the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the missed blows.
And as if the course wasn't quite reproducible in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday match, confronts Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 matches in simple, take a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
\"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a key in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
\"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.\"
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of encounters of the disputed Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has at his disposal 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven layoffs, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room,\" he explained.
\"I think younger players had fun to measure up to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play.\"
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danois played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally stepped in the lead of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, with an important 141⁄2-131⁄2.
\"You don't stop reminding yourself that we used to go to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we failed, as well as to Valderrama, where we won, but fair,\" Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to hell tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything you need.
It's not over before you get the points in the table.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that's where we need to stay focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world.\"
Ravi of the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: \"I would never move on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole other pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and everything else goes.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to pass players, it's to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind himself, he must go and get the best of himself, too.\"
Contrary to Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these last day's spins, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing the outcome of the \"Medinah Miracle\", where Europe took off the victory.
\"I remember every word,\" he explains in answer to the question of how the captain, Ben Crenshaw in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
\"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, exerts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We've established our training accordingly and put the guys as we think we have to, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.\"
Thomas was assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and facing Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
\"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course,\" Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship is still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the cold war, but it will not be in service before at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", the admiral ship of all new frigates of Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern that occurred after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of air and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some furtive technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the dock ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy was returning a ship to a ship builder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of \"software and material defects\" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important because Bade-Wurtemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is greatly overloaded, reducing its performance and reducing the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" of 7,000 tonnes weighed twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), compared with $2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is diminishing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Marine is in fact \"short of ships able to deploy\".
The official stated that the situation had caused a snowball effect over time, as old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how bats use landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of shouts of bats and the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the largest areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of bats have declined considerably during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the paths and result in the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can the paper kill-mouths and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as the attacks of company cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, brush inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the Treave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
\"Here, in Three, we have an ideal place for bats,\" he says.
\"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so much so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to prosper.\"
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats prior to the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without wanting it a single nest of maternity, it could cause the death of 400 females and small ones, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to assist.
She said, \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations right now.\"
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as \"false information,\" and stated that people \"want to get to know each other\" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he would have paid him $35,000 to keep quiet about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the spread of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as \"false information\".
“ No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information,\" said the five-year-old Golden Ball winner in the camera.
\"They want to do pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,\" added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to prosecute Der Spiegel regarding these allegations, which they have described as \"unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.\"
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek reparation for \"moral damage of a amount proportional to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.\"
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a \"good guy\" at \"99%\" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining \"1%\".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement to the amicable because she felt \"terrified by reprisals\" and feared \"to suffer public humiliation.\"
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would \"forever regret\" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom \"would forever regret it\" if it lost its world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was \"disquieting\" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
\"We need an agreement,\" Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures the Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles - has built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
\"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers call risks to Brexit's supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in \"tenduous flows\", and parts arrive at all 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured by order.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could result in delays and room shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is \"specifically calibrated in order to avoid these controls at the border\".
\"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will, as I said, not only enjoy the current success, but also seize this opportunity,\" he said in the BBC's Radio 4's Today issue.
\"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains.\"
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be halted, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly worried: \"According to my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.\"
A government spokesperson said: \"We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.\"
White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be \"rested for a week\", while the struggle for the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser to investigate Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible barriers to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether Trump will return to the Deputy Attorney General, and will therefore endanger Mueller's independence, fuel rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a micro to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he \"would rather not\" send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week inquiry into complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the Senate's vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, \"No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if one more week is left because of all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up to date.\"
The statement would be contested by some journalists: Since 10 September, Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of conferences was not due to an aversion for television \"demagogic\" reporters, although she said, \"I have nothing against the fact that they scare the gallery.\"
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that \"the president participates in more sessions of questions and answers than any other president before him\": \"We have checked the figures.\"
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, but \"If the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it frequently, you've seen it well in recent weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States.\"
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for press conferences to be held alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and by moments a strange appearance before the journalists gathered.
On concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: \"During the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I consider the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.\"
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the second of the Tigers of Tennessee, was urgently operated after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
\"He arrived on the hit-and-run line,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch-line before placing it on a cyvier and taking it to another test.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris explained that there was still no \"information on the type or extent of the injury\" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plagues in total on Saturday before leaving the match, bringing his total of the season to 18 plaquages.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help homeless people in the context of the new conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling books a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they purchase a property in the UK - the additional money will help homeless people, will announce Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committed to providing more affordable housing and targeting high income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp law, including the highest levels established two years ago on secondary residences and purchasing-locations - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling pounds per year.
About 13% of the new London constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents primers from taking a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become \"fantom cities\" because of the high number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time outside the country.
This new policy occurs just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamping rights in order to help more young people acquire a first house.
By accusing large construction companies of maintaining real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using them, he invited Ms May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the \"real estate disgrace\" that served in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of \"unreasonably\" evictions.
It would also like to give advice to more extensive powers to build new housing.
May said, \"Last year, I said that I would dedicate my premier position to the revival of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to purchase a house as for hard-working British residents.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the poverty of homeless remains too real.\"
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his \"ultimate ambition\" is to become the Scottish selector at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborning the North-East club, which now occupies the third place of League 1, three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I used to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for division B and that's all,\" said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
\"But I grew up following Scotland's games to Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
On the other hand, this opportunity would only appear if I succeeded in managing the club.\"
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's selectionists are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Technician of Alloa Athletic states that he has not hesitated to place himself behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question \"Can I bring this club back to Premier League?\"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the First League,\" he added.
\"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably not consider myself a success here if I managed to bring the club back there.\"
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa get back from a third division relegation and transformed St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into the winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The takeover of Alloa \"was probably a real crossroads,\" he recalls.
\"I really thought that being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got away with it, that I was making a good living and that I took advantage of some worthwhile summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pinte is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canicle brought up the incomes of the British pubs in difficulty, but encouraged the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA council firm, who compiled the data, said: \"The permanent sunbathing and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup made the month of July follow the model of June, where bars had an increase of 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent in the catering sector in June only increased in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than the restaurants that fall down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restorers.
It seems people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.\"
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst for recreation and the RSM hotel, said: \"These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors with regard to out-of-home sales.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less timely for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved review.\"
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the establishment.
The sales of the industry are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one out of five children have secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one out of five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the \"false Insta\" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a \"main\" account to show their parents
A child in five, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of \"false Insta accounts\" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a \"main\" account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to \"defile me\".
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of students recognizing private accounts.
CSM leader Mike Buchanan said, \"It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them.\"
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as the non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the Scottish athlete most decorated in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive experience at the international level over the past ten years.
\"Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and World Athleteism community and we are sure that Athleteism in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the Council,\" said Beattie.
Doyle said, \"I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.\"

On-line, an advertising on the milk band that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a dairy company compares suckling mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the \"first silent milk shot in the world\", Elvie, a major public technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom that his new milk-and-milk band offers to breastfeeding women.
In a flock of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: \"Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see tail\" and \"In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not the nipples.\"
The ref continues: \"Pump it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women betraying the milk.\"
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the \"horrors\" of the dairy industry.
\"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days after their birth,\" wrote one of them.
Elvie is quietly adapted to a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mère)
Another commented: \"This is understandable trauma to the mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a shot for mothers who keep their babies?\"
Someone else added, \"So offline.\"
Others defended advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song \"hilarant\".
\"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pomper made me feel like I was a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product,\" someone wrote.
Someone else commented: \"It's a fun advertisement for moms who take their milk (often on their place of work or toilets) and feel like \"ows\".
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry.\"
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet sunbeds concealed in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the shot say they have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie milk is completely silent, with no sons or pipes and discreetly inserted into a breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: \"Elvie milk is a product so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will bring.
It's not the first time the Elvie milk makes one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants settled silently in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has greatly increased despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly owing to the fact that Trump administration's severe speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to invest in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared that they would compromise their own ability to stay in the country by taking a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of the persons arrested did not have legal history.
\"About 80% of people who are respondents or members of their family are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,\" said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before them.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be non-eligible will be promptly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports that have been presented in recent months by the network of shelters, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to defenders of the rights of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate a trauma that many have difficulty in managing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish \"occupancy forces\" to withdraw overnight.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they \"would be treated accordingly.\"
\"They must withdraw immediately and without condition,\" he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the \"war on terrorism is almost over\" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of others have been torn out of their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue to \"go on to conduct this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged\" both of the two terrorist groups and of any \"unlawful foreign presence\".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said regarding refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused of \"some Western countries\" of \"proproviding irrational concerns\" that discouraged refugees from returning.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement provided for \"specific delays\" and hoped that military measures would target jihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who \"will be eliminated\".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee gathering members of the government and opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to \"revision of the articles of the current constitution\", and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberian viewers may expect, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would probably be \"The most spectacular final of a presidency!\"
At this time, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at high listening hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during the big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
\"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand,\" commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama series \"Designed Survivor\" which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a leading comic writer and author of \"Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sliding into the Hollywood Boys' Club,\" has another theory for him.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
\"He said, \"Because he makes me laugh,\" said Ms. Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike everything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when looking at a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a \"deep know-how\" for his book \"Fear\" on the autrich leather jacket at $15,000 from Paul Manafort (\"a garment filled with pride\" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Storm Daniels delivered from, uh, the anatomy of Mr. Trump.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
\"If part of what he does makes it feel like to see a tele-reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of \"Pawn Stars\", about Trump's changing teams and daily situation returns (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr.Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the north bank of Kauai, but he would land inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not step aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to confront the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
\"I remember the time when we excited all these crazy emissions and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" Mr. Fleiss told me.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.\"

The money from outside invades the tightest half-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of Congress electoral districts that allowed two incumbents to contest the same seat.
This recently restructured Pittsburgh suburb district is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another electoral district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The new 17th district race led to a clash in the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party financing, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a fair victory last March during a special election very popular in the 18th District of the Pennsylvania Congress.
It was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in the district.
Politologists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leader of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against \"their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,\" said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the department, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions were only planned against Salvador, which received estimated US aid of $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotic drugs and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on economic security and prosperity to follow up a similar meeting held last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against the Savior.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now hearing at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, to the diplomats.
And the three American emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next kill could be the special lawyer Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible impediment to justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the issue of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack against our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be obliged to report to that body, at the time he is ready to stand before the voters and, perhaps, before a jury of his peers.
There are many \"yes\", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to hold a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and pushed the Czechoslovakians to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly register the president and gave assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times' reporting was inaccurate.
\"What will we answer if the recent FBI inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump for accounts?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, Immigrant to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light sabbatical candles on the swastika table.
With this heritage in heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future.\"

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify as Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived the field environment Graham Dorrans from his first participation of the season until the 2:2 match against Villarreal, but he is convinced that Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve exploits.
\"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,\" commented the 31-year-old attacker.
\"We went into the game thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
Perhaps we could have taken it to the end, but overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half-time and we went back to the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result during their last match, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave the season behind us and triumph.\"
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke about the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study stated that they spoke with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking to their children.
\"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation,\" said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a repurchase-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these or other wealth insurance - provided you have the means to secure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Provide for a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure the payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Consider the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
\"There is not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?\" asked Martin.
\"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man was injured several times with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed-air rifle as he was walking home from an evening.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2 h 30 BST, as a \"random act\".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries didn't threaten his life, and the police called for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance should rise.
As communications were paralyzed, relief services could not receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that takes more than 300 km (180 miles) from coasts to the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency was estimated to be an administrative region below one province, at 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the central Sulawesi province's economy, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala were affected by tsunamis several times over a century ago, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that spread over 14 countries, making 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March in early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 casualties.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the people of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunamis were caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have shaken the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, in violation of a reported marital and arrest-resisting violence, as reported in a release published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under a non-secure security deposit of $500, KTU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself \"not guilty, it is safe\" when his plea was sought, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a class B minor offence, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, with interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His companion had claimed that he had struck him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after having made the link between her son's violent behavior and the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Séisme en Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are broken down and the victims' balance sheet is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake declared itself just off the center of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had met for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami collapsed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for someone suspected of terrorist attack in New York City
New York Federal Prosecutors apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assaulter who has committed eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, would have used a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a cycling trail on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, crashing on his pedestrian route and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide proof that Saipov \"intentionally\" murdered the eight victims and \"intentionally\" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the South New York District.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight indictments of murder for extortion of funds, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required \"a thorough preparation and premeditation,\" said the prosecutors, describing the method used by Saipov as \"hateful, cruel and depraved\".
\"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco,\" says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to have engaged in conspiracy and espionage acts for the USSR during the two years that followed the cold war.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial evidence.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been prompted to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was \"evidently disappointed\" with the decision to prosecute.
\"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.

Nigel Farage today promised to \"mobilize the People's Army\" at a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians should \"feel pressure\" from Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Rear Conservative Member Peter Bone stated during Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom \"had already been released\" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union that joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has a hard time maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would require Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the \"chaos\".
Mr. Bone told the gathering of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to \"get rid of Chequers\".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,\" he said.
Wellingborough added: \"I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.\"
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: \"We have not engaged in world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own laws in our own country.\"
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: \"The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.\"
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of exit, was also present on the march to tell journalists: \"I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Everyone is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Abandon Chequers and start listening.\"
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.\"
\"Mr. Farage told the gathering that politicians should be forced to \"feel pressure\" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
\"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class,\" he said.
They try to mislead Brexit and we say to them today, \"We will not let you out of this way.\"
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: \"I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.\"
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart, Lord Adonis, mocked Conservatives for the security issues related to the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
\"They assure us that they are able to establish computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the friction-free border, for free-trade without borders in Ireland,\" he added.
\"It's a real joke.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist,\" he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren states that she will seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical to President Donald Trump, is present for the November election against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of the speculation that it could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to attend the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come \"for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman head of the state.\"
Arrested at death by Sims Ball of Louisiane State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by basketball ball, Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by ball Friday morning, near Southern University campus.
\"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to his head and succumbed to his injuries,\" said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Interrogated, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, has played 32 games, including 10 as the last season, and has averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heading for the world title after the team's guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became obvious from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by conquering Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's guidelines would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broke Hamilton on the flank while he defended his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the front stands and left Hamilton to go into the torment at the peloton tail, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands a turn later and found herself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage of a wheeled action that saw the Ferrari pilot go against the inner part at the risk of resisting a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speedy arrival and to run Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands in the 44th round, but was not able to speed up the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen closing fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two,\" said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were \"wicked, disgusting and dishonest.\"
\"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens these last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,\" he said.
\"When they saw the disclosures and leaks, they said, \"Oh, I didn't.
I didn't -
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information--oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't disclosed anything.
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,\" he added, thinking of the senator's appearance.
Feinstein received in July from Ford the letter describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in detail, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
\"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story,\" Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
\"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me.\"
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the gathering: \"I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president indicated that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
\"They are determined to take over power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettyness, they don't know who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control,\" said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their Friday defeat in Elite League against the Belfast Giants by triggering the 5-3 game back to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard equaled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the post four minutes later.
During a first well-appointed period, Sullivan re-launched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team met again and Bouchard was once again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by marking a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller died by assisting hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he has died, ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many others were reported missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to abandon his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it was going to collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Siria, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, stated that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
\"Our heart is broken to learn this,\" he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency of the country indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
\"The balance sheet would continue to rise because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be rescued,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, agency spokesman
Waves up to six metres have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: \"Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.\"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: \"The Indonesian Red Cross runs to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.\"
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian President, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: \"I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?\", said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after the crash of an airplane in the lagoon.
The airline managing the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has been missing, after 47 passengers and crew members have safely evacuated the aircraft that was flying.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was not able to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships took part in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit water by trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities stated Friday that seven persons had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy stated that the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses felt that the aircraft had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
\"It's a very good thing,\" Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the rescue exits of the plane were flowing.
he claimed that the on-board agents had panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in aircraft accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none related to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its file on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls passed from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis e was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford looked like the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he declared himself in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he \"was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.\"
Another inconsistencies lie in the fact that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
\"He wiped it out of his life,\" Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A trio hip hop wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins from political messages and social issues.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
New York City's Nouvelle is pursuing a court-martialed couple for dismissal after a \"racist\" text
A New York noun is being prosecuted for discriminatory dismissal after having received an error message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black.”
The couple refuse to be racist, and assimilates the prosecution to an “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dismay by noting in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nonuo, was Black when he arrived for his first day of work.
\"NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE ONE NOIRE\", writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gafe, \"bad at ease,\" Plasco-Flaxman sent her back to Mauritius, explaining that their former noun, which was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then returned home by a Uber.
Now, Mauritius is pursuing the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her return and seeks compensation of $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
\"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that sort of thing,\" she said to the Friday Post, adding, \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he might not be able to trust him after he had wronged him.
\"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,\" said Joel Plasco at the Post.
\"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!\"
Assimilating the trial to a \"extortion,\" Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a \"very delicate situation\".
\"Would you pursue someone like that?
It's not a very pleasant thing to do,\" added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves to a bear who speaks, they would reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: \"It is difficult to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before her publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success.\"
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic in the face of his rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a \"sweet-yellow\" taste after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a \"very important member of our family,\" and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
\"He was quite a calm man, and he was not a pretentious man,\" she said.
\"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Though it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter was taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save her life.
\"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to work out,\" said Ednan-Laperouse.
\"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was taking place.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep up.\"
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in grief of her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
\"No one knew,\" she said.
\"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost expensive people by suicide strive to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis,\" she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with an infectious smile.
\"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room.\"
However, he left his job before he died, since he was \"in a very dark place.\"
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, \"I am constantly afraid that there is a training effect.\"
Ms. Davis created the cards \"to let people know that there are people you can see and to whom you can talk, even if he is a friend.
Don’t keep quiet — you have to talk. ”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after the death of her mother.
\"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or otherwise,\" she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything.\"
She said that her death had been a tremendous trauma for them, but they had to get out of it: \"It's tearing up for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.\"

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI starts its investigation.
\"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking - a limited inquiry in time, limited in its scope - we might bring some unity,\" said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would \"deep\" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called on the telephone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We still do not know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to separate the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters \"fall\" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unification, stated that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of the deserters in the North will ultimately be given South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DDZ), between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriated them.
The relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the context of talks focused on the remaining denuclearization negotiations that were still pending.
This occurred after the historic meeting of June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the main lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed on American sanctions the absence of progress since then.
\"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,\" said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical,\" and claims that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and stated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as \"hysterical,\" Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes failed to scream and get choked by referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of \"grotesque and coordinated murder\" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hilary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
\"I think he disagrees with these statements and how he took himself to the Clintons and Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats were getting the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he is at present,\" Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the issue of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
\"It's not time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we said: \"it's not wonderful,\" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it cannot bring it out without crying.
\"We cry when we do,\" said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's rare, do you?\"
\"I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she became angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to when she was angry and crying: \"You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry.\"
And then she kept going.
And I found it brilliant.\"
The tears are allowed as exutory to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I found myself one day crying out of an inexpressable rage, was having been seized by the skin of the neck by an older woman - a cold director who had always a little terrified me - who led me into a staircase.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" she told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they've had you.\"
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extra-marital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
\"It wasn't a well-considered decision,\" she told me, laughing 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called this \"Black White and Seven Nains.\"
As the campaign was very advanced, it had delayed fundraising, and thus swore that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave men $1,000 had only $250.
\"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?\" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration against the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt dizzy.
\"You would have thought I was making a nervous depression,\" said Ms. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
\"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
\"Did she cry?\"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues from the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important increase this week has occurred with new customs duties affecting items worth US$ 200 billion (£150 billion), thus charging half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing returned in kind, hitting customs duties from 5 to 10 per cent on 60 billion US dollars.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will collapse.
To push back Washington is to give in to the demands, but to publicly surrender to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
The experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
\"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers previously recognized,\" said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is \"prepared\" on the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding this war-torn country for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country was improving.
\"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six other million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the United States team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has recovered the title when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team has crossed the bar of the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his departure to the 16th hole in by-3, turning his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 across the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become Europe's champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
\"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than I am.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it,\" said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple last Sunday.
\"I feel incredible pride, beat Tiger Woods, grew up looking at this guy,\" said Rahm, age 23.
Woods has lost four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who took off 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: \"I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going ahead.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow.
We've outgrown each other.\"
