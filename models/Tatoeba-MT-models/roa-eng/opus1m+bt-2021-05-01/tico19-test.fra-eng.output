Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with CVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown etiology pneumonia case was reported to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection has been called coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with CVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of whom heal.
In approximately 14% of cases, CVID-19 leads to a more severe attack requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to CVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative impact of VOC-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the developments in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEE countries and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulated number and cumulative incidence of CVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPM), the number of cases of VOC-19 reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 to 8.00 with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of CVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed that in the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of VOC-19 began to grow around 21 February before a dramatic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of VOC-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of VOC-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols for patients to be tested for the purpose of confirming COVID-19, including for catch up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of patients with CVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of CVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not reported).
However, systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for saturation of the care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised CVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM's rapid risk assessment for VOC-19.
Given that the cases were so far grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case data and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with CVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as well as in the affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized by the recent EPCM rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from an indigo approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave sufficient time for policy makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without this, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to cope with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), has so far resulted in over 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-COV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this topic of full-scale research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on 25 January 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the whole of the golden week as well as for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (COV) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SARS) in 2003; that is why SARS-COV-2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease called coronaryvirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before extending to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is \"public enemy number 1\", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which was isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in full expansion.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary virus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also be taking stock of what we have learned so far in terms of the prevention and prognosis of the disease, and will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for man, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronary virus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia then of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, considered to be the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, but more mostly in the 30-65 age range.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 was developing in households, mainly in the province of Hubei and outlying areas.
The mean duration between symptoms and diagnosis of CVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10%-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for CVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple brin RNA.
They can be classified in four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the Man belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
The Spike (S) glycoprotein of the envelope binds to the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, respectively, then a membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-COV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the market for seafood from Huan to Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine human epithelium sections of the airways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by the orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of ICNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete ACE2 cryo-ME structure to a 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV came from bats and that they were transmitted to man via the civets and camélids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses, bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21 have been advanced as the native host of SARS-COV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect man remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., gave the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to man by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-mixed mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-COV-2.
However, a 1% gap between two genomes is a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-COV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a host virus is infected, it is first recognized by the immune system born of the host through the recognition receptors for molecular motifs (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll (TLR) receivers, NOD (NLR) receivers and RIG-I (RLR) receivers.
By different means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferences (ICNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+-cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humor immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient have neutralized the MERS-COV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, to multiple-visceral failure or even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally, 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with respect to an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective 40-year duration following the most accurate incubation period possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic persons.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VOC-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, breathlessness, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients presented with dyspnea and/or hypoglycaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Regarding severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as patients with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that the patients presented from fever to 98%, dry cough to 76%, dyspnoea to 55% and diarrhea to 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies of a family and a household that emerged following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MSR-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VOC-19, which is consistent with higher MERS lethality compared to VOC-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
Regarding SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat disease (13-25%), and that ventilation assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of VOC-19 was 2%, for 66,576 cases globally confirmed.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-COV-2, MERS-COV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much harder to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase quarantine duration.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with CVID-19.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and high myoglobin in the blood, and most had an elevation of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimer rate, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with CVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or dispolitic glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis seriously impairs gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the rate of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of CVID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytia cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with viral infection and SDRA pathology and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of VOC-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative fakes, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-COV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-COV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive stripe in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens was conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support to patients with CVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restored patients' plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even restored patients' plasma has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies all work to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily targeted at the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
For example, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-speed oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been established to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MRS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of the T-cell immune response, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 signal suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroid intake has not had any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and CVID-19.
Instead, they would result in severe side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe CVID-19 form.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remedesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has proved effective in an American patient with CVID-19.
Remedesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, memdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-brin RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow for a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-COV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been developed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic lesions and other side effects may occur following a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have healed a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high level of antibody to the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Thus plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who were cured from CVID-19 and injected with 10 patients who were seriously affected.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, decreased viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related drawbacks should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies may cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokines release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from re-established patients and identify genetic codes that codify relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against major virus proteins.
This would allow for a rapid increase in the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of the CM.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal associations.
At present, due to the lack of specific effective treatment of VOC-19, the TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or with severe disease remission.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for VOC-19 were observed in provinces of China using the TCM for 87 per cent of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7 per cent), Ningxia Region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei Province, which used only 30 per cent of patients with CVID-19, presented the lowest rate of healing (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using western medicine (MO) only and a combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, time to disappear symptoms and duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through more-scale controlled tests and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of CM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the CVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the patients regarding the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with CVID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccines in the elderly and in models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection still remains to be determined, since no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS turned out 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic households of MRS continue to report in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the important time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, VOC-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential so that health agencies can prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with CVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for the SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for the COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with CVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-COV-2 can also bind to ACE positive cholangiocytes2, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with CVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Anomalous laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it was advanced as a potential prognostic factor of the disease, the response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the RCP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, particularly at the heart and liver levels, and are released in the event of tissue lesions.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of CVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressors commonly used in extra treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors presented avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration in patients with CVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and to a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the CVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, often patients with long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and support over the long term in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, VOC-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-COV-2 also responds effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not result in symptoms or symptoms in the first phase of the infection, as well as coronaviruses resulting from common colds.
As a result, recently infected individuals or during incubation can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly hampers the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than was the SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all of the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., considers that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not expire by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outbreak of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-COV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the samples of the middle nasal horn and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their hospital release, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola virus was expected to result in up to a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as with SARS-COV, that SARS-COV-2 weakens in terms of infectiosity in order to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the CVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-COV-2 is highly transmissible by cough or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in saddles, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of the cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
This means taking precautionary measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm virions, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjustable insulation blocks to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-COV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals must also wear transparent sights or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is highly recommended to wash their hands with soap disinfecting more often than usual, to stay confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention assured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message resulted in a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from them and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as every word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show greater sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than expect formal reports from doctors or official organizations; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than to try to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises in order to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to regularly test and improve the society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of already-see.
However, there are significant differences between VOC-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality are also more important in older people.
SARS has a mortality greater than VOC-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of the CVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VOC-19.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 has spread much faster and more widely than SARS-COV.
Regular screening of SARS-COV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with CVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may again be positive in the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of the EVOC-19 research, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruss from bats, it is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-COV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, e.g. bats, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-COV-2 binds to the ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Is it going to evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, although this may take time, to obtain answers to all these questions and to many others.
However, no matter what expenses this must entail, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
Without counting super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, fake liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in the case of suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower airways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of choryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospital patient due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in man, they also become less virulent or pathogen.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an evolving acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MRS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MRS in relation to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most deadly known human viruses.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-COV-2 have been reported and could contribute to their rapid worldwide spread.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of saddles.
However, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after human transmission, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four community HCoVs cause moderate symptoms were well suited to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate the host's restriction factors.
In this perspective, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more important the number of people infected is, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to man.
If he adapts well, his transmission between men will be difficult to stop by some quarantine or other control measures of infections.
For many years, the four COVs acquired in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV did not adapt well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the four HCOVs acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired and less pathogenic HCoVs than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without host animal reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of the HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotidic sequence.
The origin virus has often been well adapted and is non-pathogenic for its host.
In the same way, a tank host houses HCoV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of the Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-COV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amp hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
The converting enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIPO1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-COV and that bats are not the host immediate reservoir of SARS-COV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate host of the MERS-COV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that drug users were HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-COV, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by the airways, but also by fecal means, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and the RaTG13 is even less important than the distance between the beta-COV associated with SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from the COV of bats, while the parent HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another COV of bats, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the barrier of species to infect humans from domestic cattle in about 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near the HCoV-229E were found.
First of all, unlike the alpadas, men can have a contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpagas.
Next, the alpha-CoV of the HIV-229E-related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of the alpada has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpada was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-COV of the bat serves as a genetic reservoir of the HCoV-229E, the alpadas and dromadaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-COV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromads and dromadaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-COV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been present in drug users for decades.
He has adapted well for these camels that have moved from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-COV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-COV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several interspecies transmission options from SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a SARS-COV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scraping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifiers to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus with the scrapping and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-COV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been both in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared with other single-brin RNA viruses, the estimated COV mutation rates could be considered as \"moderate\" to \"high\" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the COV adaptation phase to the new hosts.
However, the rates of COV mutation are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when the CoVs have not been well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-COV-2, this applies also to MERS-COV, which has been well adapted to drug users.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the COVs change randomly and frequently as a model when replication of the RNA through a unique mechanism of \"choice-copy\".
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for the COVs observed in the animal, such as SL-COV and batCOV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cellular receiver as SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 unit of protein S means that the binding affinity of this protein S with the human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, the HCoV-NL63 also binds to the ACE2 but with a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylase sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and the host natural reservoirs of HCoV, such as bats, dromads and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the starting box
The diversity of COV bats offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the COVs of bats are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the accessory proteins of the SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in adapting to humans, given that sap-soris viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but were coded for divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced recombination episodes between different lines, which have occurred in dromadarians in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in mice and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpada presents a simple nucleotide insertion, leading to a decrease in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with COVs, indicating mutual adaptation between COVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by COV.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect ‘relecture’ by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogens could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host tanks such as bats and camels.
They respond solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammase with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of VOC-19.
While a bat-coV of bat-sucker sharing 95% nucleotidic homology with SARS-COV has been discovered, there is also a COV of bats sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
The presence of pangolin beta-COV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-COV could contribute to genetic fragments in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
The COV returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-COV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has existed in the dromadaria for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MRS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the COV of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the COV and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-COV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to note in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by simply introducing behavioural changes, such as handwashing in soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing can weaken the skin by causing a rash.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing could result in hand-based eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
Two times a year, associated with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of soil, are hardly soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants will target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, although antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aloe vera, vitamins, minthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from their hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, lukewarm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies revealed that the use of lukewarm water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcohol solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydro-alcohol solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The dry effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcohol solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydroalcohol solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic materials present on their hands, but only cause them to disinfect.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on hand.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for hands without alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if land or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends as an alternative to soap as an ash or sand when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Mash a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing it against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Starfleet for at least 20 seconds.
Frying action creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin may result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or air-free towel.
Wet and wet hands are more easily controlled.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and square-angle varnishes can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, drain water from a bottle or gourd suspended and pierced and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as \"typy-taps\" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crunch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electrical dryers often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with hot-air drying, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% finger pulp and on the 15% palms.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dry-main manufacturers, and the dry-mains were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital personnel forget to wash their hands.
Medical washing of hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to grind and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of hand-washing in health structures is to remove pathogen microorganisms (\" germs\") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/to biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearm should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very little additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce child disease and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 kronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a hand-washing emoji.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of handwashing in soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid smells called myasms.
For example, in Germany, posters showing \"good hand washing techniques\" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression \"washing hands\" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of \"purification\", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require that they wash their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be pointed out that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which most likely follow the pressures of selection, especially by the host's immune system.
For example, the loss of the complete ORF4 in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, due to a two nucleotide deletion, can be mentioned as an example.
While an ORF4 could be observed in mice and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpada presents a simple nucleotide insertion, leading to a decrease in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with COVs, indicating mutual adaptation between COVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by COV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules in the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect ‘relecture’ by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogens could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host tanks such as bats and camels.
They respond solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammase with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of VOC-19.
SARS-COV-2 appeared following the general schedule by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a bat-coV of bat-sucker sharing 95% nucleotidic homology with SARS-COV has been discovered, there is also a COV of bats sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
While cyvets and other animals on the markets have been discovered as carriers of virus identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 has been identified.
The presence of pangolin beta-COV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-COV could contribute to genetic fragments in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although there are still questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The COV returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-COV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and the civets present in the markets, the closure of the fresh product markets and the slaughter of the civets found there would have been able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the studies to follow.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has existed in the dromadaria for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MRS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the COV of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities for these zoonotic VOCs to evolve and recombin, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly VOCs in man in the future.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many favorable features for the spread of viruses, the probability for humans to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the COV and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-COV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-COV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to note in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to hire SARS-COV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will help to clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-COV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOC-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for \"suspect cases\" and \"confirmed cases\" of COVID-19 is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic at the global level.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a \"suspect case\" and a \"confirmed case\" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronary virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named as a severe acute coronaryvirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has attracted a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that VOC-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) totalled seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further proof for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for VOC-19 (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must associate one of the characteristics of epidemiological antecedents with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological antecedents:
epidemiological antecedents: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in the neighbouring areas or other communities where CVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-COV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where CVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in the area of 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a CVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific SARS-COV-2 antibody IgG from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal Nucleal Acid Detection Kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as \"low risk\".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and we ask readers to convey their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of \"suspect cases\" and \"confirmed cases\", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in due time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in one day.
The country thus records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease and Research Monitoring (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-COV-2 coronary virus infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The epidemics of acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) have reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogens.
The intermediate storage hosts of certain HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host-coV interactions in animals could also make it possible to better understand the CoV in humans.
According to differences in protein sequences, VOCs are classified as four types (alpha-COV, beta-COV, gamma-COV and delta-COV). The genus Beta-COV contains the majority of HCVOs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-COV and beta-COV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-COV and delta-COV.
To date, seven human COV (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-COV.
The other five beta-COV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of the HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the barrier of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the host(s) reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-COV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal COVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaise and throat pains, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of the cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the limit amounts of toilet paper by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase restrictions of toilet paper to two and a parcel by purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits were displayed as messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently massed reservations out of fear of the COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages by purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, \"many stores are still in stock break within the hour of delivery,\" and called the request \"unprecedented\", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, described it as \"unexpected\".
Sales had a \"strong increase\" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made early supplies for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, stated that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on delivery times by truck make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stocks, some stores are unable to honor the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology in Queensland, explained that stores resupply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
\"Colles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buyed] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic,\" Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap stated last Wednesday that they were in stock break.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included a set of eight pages to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Stores were first reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report of March 3, ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British Ocado online supermarket limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies the VOC-19 as the pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of COVID-19 (coronary artery disease SARS-COV-2) pandemic.
Although the word \"pandemic\" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the dangerousness of the specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
\"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries dismiss, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
\"We are very concerned not only with alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also with alarming levels of inaction.\"
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “no precedent”.
He stated, in a statement published by CNN in February, that \"except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued worldwide spread.\"
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that \"we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.\"
He added, \"and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.\"
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding the epidemic: \"For short, the situation will get worse.\"
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronary virus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOC-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth for coughing, staying away from others, and monitoring and confining those suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by establishing restrictions on travel, quarantines, curfews, risk controls at workplaces and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has led to serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, with approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Because of the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a case of unknown cause pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, and it is therefore believed that the virus would be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-COV-2, a recently discovered virus closely linked to the coronavirus of bats, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-COV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have a clear link to the subsequent home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first household reported in December 2019, the two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a person aged 55 from Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19 years of age and under 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before effective collective immunity can be achieved.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at the COVID-19, and the test was confirmed positively according to the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who presented only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that up to January 23 China estimated 86% of the undetected CVID-19 infections, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the base reproduction rate (R0) of the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years old, and 75% had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death counts related to the disease of CVID-19 generally refer to the deceased who were tested positive for VOC according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of the COVID-19 could be much higher, since it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of over-mortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official counting of the deaths of the VOC.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that \"We know that [the number of deaths announced] is understated,\" a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such under-estimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic, The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators were commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-decease ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-decease ratio is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-deceased report decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the rate of lethality (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and are followed by a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the rate of infection for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for VOC-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of tests on the estimates of the lethality rate.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University said: \"Without control, infectious epidemics generally stabilize and then begin to return when the disease is lacking in hosts available.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at present when this will happen.\"
The chief medical adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan stated that \"this could be completed by June\" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-COV-2 \"will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two\".
According to a study by Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary \"until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)\".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, \"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, which it transmits very easily, would \"disappear completely\" and that it could \"be transformed into seasonal disease, which is likely to reappear each year.\"
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of CVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and the infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, breathlessness, muscle and joint pain, throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysia, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six people is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have issued recommendations that those who have had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
China's asymptomatic ratio assessments range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days.A good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of patients with CVID-19 who lost the odor was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly in close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during expiry, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postells may land in the mouth or nose of other people located next to or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may result in respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China excluded the possibility of faeco-oral transmission of SARS-COV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days prior to the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you don't know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, a person usually pollutes two to three others. The virus survives hours and even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after a day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature; domestic animals and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the British authorities recommend washing their hands after affecting animals, as after having been in contact with other areas that infected persons might have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia related to Wuhan acute respiratory disease cases.
All characteristics of the new SARS-COV-2 virus exist in the associated coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-COV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (linking B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the genome as the whole of another sample of batCov rat virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
The comparison of the genome as a whole has revealed to date a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanners.
A study comparing the PCR and the Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that \"the scanner should not be used as a first-intent test to diagnose COVID-19\".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-COV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sampling but a gorge sampling can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodensitometry (scan) of individuals with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral depoli glass opacity and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Because of mixing with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of chest scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in both imaging and X-rays.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a mold and then throwing the flyer directly into a garbage bag.
Those who had already been infected were advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have banned or advised all non-essential displacements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. It advises health professionals who care for someone who might be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact research is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for such surveillance limitations.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of one user near other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, getting a nose and squirting with mouthbath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71%, isopropanol at 50-00%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodine povidone at 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a nursery, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their neck folds or handkerchiefs when they touch or sneez, and to throw off everything immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the postillons designed by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, \"Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.\"The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they care for a patient with CVID-19, even though they recognize that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded locations.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to manufacture and clean facial masks every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public exits without masks or other means of covering its nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the port of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the port of the mask on passengers of trains and long-distance buses on April 1st.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a craft mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also referred to as physical distance) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contacts between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting themselves without contact and maintaining a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by government and health agencies in the United States has been reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system experienced an increased risk of serious disease and complications, and the CDC was therefore invited to stay home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distance\", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, either virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term \"social distance\" led to the belief that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus, or who does not present the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with positive CVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantines for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with CVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are indiguation or suppression, and mitigation.
Indigoment is in place during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other control measures for infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow down this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures of indigo and mitigation can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called applying the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the port of masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to juggle the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to the quarantined infected, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because in the opposite case, transmission flows rapidly when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOC-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without an prescription for cold or drinking, as well as rest, can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOC-19.
WHO stated that some \"traditional and artisanal remedies\" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for patients with CVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to the attention of primary health care hospitals and services for redeploying resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to VOC-19 testing, by canceling non-emergency interventions where possible, by separating and insulating patients tested positive at VOC-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of kronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the wholesale market of sea fruits of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the central hospital in Wuhan warned their colleagues of a \"RAS-like coronavirus\".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation in early January. At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major rail correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people were killed and more than 364,000 were cured.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and set up border controls.
National reactions included injunction measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter, or shelter) and shelters. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a case of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was delivered by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning to \"promote rumours\" about the epidemic.
China's National Health Commission originally claimed that there was no \"evident evidence\" of transmission between human beings.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a \"people's war\" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what was described as \"the greatest quarantine in human history\", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebration of the Chinese New Year (January 25th) was cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built later: Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Spring holiday leave.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) have been involved in some form or other restriction of movement. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being \"imported\" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed an quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in the event of a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the beginning of the confinement.

The nation's health organization reported a considerable increase in cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement named the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
The Shincheonji faithful who visited Daegu since Wuhan were suspected of the outbreak of the epidemic.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church members, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea and 3 150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
The airlines' schedules have also been reached and therefore modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population of the virus, and isolate all infected people, as well as follow and quarantine the people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile application, the virus screening drives delivering the results the following day, and an increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it did not put all cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's mismanagement of the government's epidemic or, on the contrary, praising its reaction.
On 23 March, South Korea experienced the lowest daily number of cases in four weeks.

At least 12 former or active Iranian politicians and government members died of the disease on March 17.
On March 23, Iran knew 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO representative, there could be five times as many cases in Iran as the number reported.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be abolished for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
It was confirmed that the epidemic had spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists were tested positive at SARS-COV-2 in Rome.

As at 5 April, Italy accounted for 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures; the majority of these cases appeared in the Lombardy region.
A report by CNN indicated that the combination between the important elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people affected by the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, discouraging all non-essential social travel and contacts, suggesting that people work from their homes if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and showrooms.

Despite this, the United States has taken time to start testing, concealing the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
Tests were initiated by faulty screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of approval for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for applying for a test until early March (order of a mandatory physician subsequently).

Ma also donated medical equipment in Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concerns about masks and screening kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 kronavirus test kits manufactured in China with a accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protection masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 useless masks; it was thought that they came from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was welcomed in the regions of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and reducing the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealing the prevention and indigencing efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government \"provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year\".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that even if it was not \"certainly not a WHO recommendation\", it was, however, a \"very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated\" and spoke of a fact \"without precedent in the history of public health.\" On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that the USPPI was the result of the \"risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said, \"there is no reason why measures needlessly interfere with international travel and trade\" and \"WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel\".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to funding strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect those who have contracted the virus, even if it was on the verge of appearing”.
Tedros then said that we were \"as strong as our weakest link\" and urged the international community to \"invest today or pay more tomorrow.\" On 11 February, WHO established a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire United Nations system into the response”.
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the overall United Nations response, which the WHO says will enable them to \"focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.\"
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was activated in China to deploy international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and assess \"gravity and transmission of disease\" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess \"the impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas.\"On 25 February, WHO stated that \"the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic\", indicating that while it is too early to talk about pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter \"preparation phase\".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on-site to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the assessment of the global kronavirus threat had shifted from \"high\" to \"very high\", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: \"This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you have to keep ready,\" adding that good response measures could help the world avoid \"the worst.\"
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that \"we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.\"
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director General noted that WHO was \"extremely concerned both with alarming levels of propagation and severity and with alarming levels of inaction.\" WHO faced significant criticisms regarding its management of the pandemic, considered inadequate, especially due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the VOC-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to assistance and that this responsibility was in the Government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, refugees and other unspecified groups in need of support from the Government.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on political responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies for strengthening health systems and the world economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of Michael Gove and the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his pandemic management, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were identified from their functions as a result of quarantine management in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronary virus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the kronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration described the coronavirus as \"China virus\" or \"Wuhan virus,\" stating that in China \"censorship has overpowered a virus that has now become a worldwide pandemic,\" which was later taxed racism by some opponents and aimed at \" diverting the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease.\"
The Daily Beast produced a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the main lines of an apparently national Security Council communication strategy: \"Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in every way possible, especially at press conferences and television appearances.\" Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a push of propaganda to gain influence at the global level.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was \"a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and \"generosity politics.\"
Borrell also stated that \"China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.\"
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own countries.
Other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that \"only China had answered bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.\"
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous \"high political source\" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was \"not even useful for Italy\".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of \"geopolitic and diplomatic\" charm.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Luigi Di May denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft in charge of medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated that \"by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Putine] starts from the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have won the speed, they will be able to make them the same if necessary.\"
The magnitude of NATO's \"Defender 2020\" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's greatest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Kate Hudson Nuclear Disarmament Campaign criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: \"In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of US troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries in which they operate.\"The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country had difficulty in fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States' sanctions on Iran. The epidemic sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's \"ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts\" after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed two weeks in quarantine at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's mismanagement of the government's epidemic or, on the contrary, praising its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further order, to suspend parliament and elections and to punish anyone who would have been accused of broadcasting false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The kronavirus epidemic was accused of several cases of supply disruption resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and an interruption of the operation of the factories and logistic operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings on drug and medical equipment shortages due to increased consumer demand and suppliers' interruption.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment was multiplied by 100.
This application led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for the Daligos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the strong demand for food that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that have been anticipated in Europe and North America.
As a result of its important agricultural production, North Italy did not see a significant decline, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food supplies were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government members released pig reserves to ensure adequate population subsistence.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy were felt in China: according to a media report of March 16, the Chinese economy was severely affected during the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
With mainland China as an important economic and manufacturing centre, it was found that the viral epidemic was a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.

The estimate of an expert from the Washington University of Saint-Louis revealed an impact of over $300 billion on the global logistics chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have been \"distorted\" after a sharp decrease in oil prices due to the decrease in demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February following a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concern about the kronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock indices including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been showing their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones down to 191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt rating, but retained a negative perspective.
The actions have fallen again due to fears related to coronavirus, the most significant decrease that was observed on 16 March.
Many think that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the UK airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has never been seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass rallies, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February, imposing on most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in opening hours of stores or temporary closures.
Visits by traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a 50 to 60 per cent decrease.
This also resulted in a fall from 33 to 43 per cent of pedestrian traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
Operators from shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 million and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, approximately 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stuck in their homes in internal or enclosed provinces in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. Angus Reid's survey observed that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed by mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment allowance and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies pushed their employees towards a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both waged and independent, at the global level.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed down to new order and their exhibitions, events and representations cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, on-line and on-line or on television while others propose to practice their worship in \"drive-in\".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square, which saw all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Médine.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Championship of England football, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 season of the LNH.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which was due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be \"replanned beyond 2020, but by the summer of 2021.\" Casinos and other world-wide gaming establishments have closed down and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have found a significant increase in their number of new entries. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have spread as many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a rise in prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been seen against people of Chinese and Asian origin, and people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been given to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the virus-affected areas.
Following the progression of the epidemic to sensitive new countries, Italians from the first European country to suffer a serious outbreak of COVID-19 could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their countries to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has raged on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus \"China virus\", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the kronavirus epidemic.
The President of the Western Bengal Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and \"that's why God took his revenge on them.\"
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which described them as \"false.\" In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were attacked by the pandemic, with foreigners described as \"foreign waste\" that should be \"removed\".
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes virus detection and antibody detection methods produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-COV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population may be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported levels of lethality, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal emboss or exposure sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngeal dumps is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues its multiplication in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken into the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a burn (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using an inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The Kogenebiotech South Korean company developed a clinical quality SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the \"E\" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-COV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency clearance from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real time from the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, one in three genetic test obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only at this time did federal and local laboratories receive permission to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based VOC-19 tests at the national level.
This Diagnostics also distributed VOC-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at the COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, enabling a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test taking approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the Nucleic Acid Isothermal Amplification Technology instead of the PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the protein of the nucleocapside (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature study concluded that \"pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive before symptoms occur.\"
Among the typical symptoms visible on the MDG are the multi-lober bilateral depoli glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, a \"crazy paving\" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the MDT in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the MDT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiology College recommended that \"the TDM should not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose the VOC-19\".In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and in the context of population monitoring. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CRTs) or by patient head test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For LLC, only one sample of peripheral blood is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the PoCT, only one sample of blood is usually taken by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and can therefore now distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.By March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective for use.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases can remain in their home, \"the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube\", the patients cracking inside, return it and later receive the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that one patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the case of the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The \"drive\" centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, test drives were available in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that, in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to the week 12/2020 included and 33 491 samples (6.9%) achieved a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and the Rambam hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at a time, grouping samples and testing only if the combined sample is positive.At Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called \"Huo-Yan\" (in Chinese: Â, i.e. \"Fire Oil\" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and may treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
As a result of its five-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that the cases in Hubei province were 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this detection capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manipating robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing the largest part of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were currently stepping up screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and purchase a population-wide high-speed laboratory with Group 42 and BGI (based on their \"Huo-Yan\" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to respond to the demand and recommendations for screening of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended that screening programmes be intensified as a best way to slow down the progress of the VOC-19 pandemic.The strong demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratories of the United States, and the reserves of sewage and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the U.S., the test kits developed by the CDC presented \"failures\".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or properly use kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have yielded wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic provided false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits in China that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a \"high error rate\" and that it did not \"use\" them. The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieved a positive result and the tracing of those who had been in contact with the carriers of SARS-COV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death linked to VOC-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who achieved a positive result did not have symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of displacement in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
As a result of aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 kronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened at the expected end of the holiday on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of VOC-19 send their first five positive samples and first ten negative samples of VOC-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column \"Positive in % of tests\" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that does not test that those admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Washing hands, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at some of the \"key moments\" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal means.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's butts or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have any water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands to ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaned a child who went to the toilet;
after wet or coughed/sneezed;
after having affected an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by simply introducing behavioural changes, such as handwashing in soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
The establishment of actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing safe drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap helps reduce diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths due to diarrhea and a quarter from acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing can weaken the skin by causing a rash.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing could result in hand-based eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mixing, defecation), after cleaning the fasses of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing, or biting, after affecting animal waste or manipulating animals and after having affected garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand cleaning in soap is low.
According to a 2015 study conducted in 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average were hand-washed with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of a table (77%) and China was the lowest (23%) rate. Today, there are several methods to improve behaviour and democratize the use of soap for handwashing at key times of the day. It is also possible, in developing countries, to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children do this practice.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a \"Primary Health Care Program\" to promote the health and education of children.
Two times a year, associated with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of soil, are hardly soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that \"automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable\".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended for those concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants will target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, although antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aloe vera, vitamins, minthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from their hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, lukewarm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies revealed that the use of lukewarm water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly called hydro-alcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcohol solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcohol solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydro-alcohol solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and the nails should be bordered for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
It is also important to clean your fingers by rubbing them, palm against palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when your hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The dry effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcohol solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydroalcohol solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis made them more attractive than hand washing in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic materials present on their hands, but only cause them to disinfect.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on hand.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for hands without alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use instead ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if land or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends as an alternative to soap as an ash or sand when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper washing of hands to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Mash a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing it against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Starfleet for at least 20 seconds.
Frying action creates friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin may result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or air-free towel.
Wet and wet hands are more easily controlled.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and square-angle varnishes can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, drain water from a bottle or gourd suspended and pierced and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as \"typy-taps\" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crunch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electrical dryers often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the dry-all paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air-jets.
After washing and drying hands with hot-air drying, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% finger pulp and on the 15% palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross contamination potential with other users of the toilets and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air-jet drier, which blows from the air outside the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling the microorganisms from the hands and the apparatus and possibly contaminating other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows micro-organisms to be disseminated at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the dry-house.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dry-main manufacturers, and the dry-mains were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in the medical environment became compulsory well after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital personnel forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical washing of hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to grind and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of nail residue, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove it.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This avoids re-contamination of the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The aim of hand-washing in health structures is to remove pathogen microorganisms (\" germs\") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient hand-cleaning rate remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of doctors and nurses failing to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed for washing and rubbing hands in the area of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect feedback from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines \"Five indications\" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/to biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medical soaps - or - antimicrobials - provides the handwashing agent with a germ destruction action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very widespread. To -frotter - - the hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a product of chlorohexidine or iodine-based washing, sterile towels to dry hands after washing them, a sterile brush for rubbing and another sterile tool to clean under nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't need to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearm should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, you should dry your hands using a sterile linen and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very little additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
When handwashing is compared with a regular soap made with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores difficult present on hand. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff at hand washing, to put more alcohol-based products at the disposal of the patient, and to send him written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand-washing is considered to be a inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health, or even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits of this practice, and lead to long-term behaviour change among the population.
To achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies has shown that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand washing in schools, one can cite the example of the UNICEF three-star Approach, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce child disease and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 kronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a hand-washing emoji.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy life years gained (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of handwashing in soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, especially for those in vulnerable situations such as the mother-in-law or the wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British \"founder of modern nursing care\".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COPID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash their hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters showing \"good hand washing techniques\" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression \"washing hands\" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It comes from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucified Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, by Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is busy washing her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she has committed and has encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering acts that are contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to value hand washing devices.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of \"purification\", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of hand washing put forward in many religions, including baatism and Hinduism, immersion (titelah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require that they wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk Controls of COVID-19 at the workplace
The risk controls of COVID-19 at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronary heart disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and the tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to an infection with COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower-risk exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory label and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average-exposure jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without AVOID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures for the prevention of infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, sanitary windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in the event of a meeting with a person with VOC-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known as having a high risk of exposure, to be at a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or sampling or handling samples of persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Trade models can change both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (in particular to run out of peak hours or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical areas severely affected by the COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, the risk factors related to the family and community context and the individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Plans for the preparation and response of infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing staff transmission, protecting people at the highest risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
Risk control hierarchy is a comprehensive framework used in health and safety at work in order to group risk controls effectively.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers. They can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls indicate changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual protective equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk for the worker, properly adapted as required (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically carried, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or taken to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures for the prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, including covering the mouth and nose to cough and sneez, providing molds and trash, preparation for teleworking or at work time as required, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms should remain at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptom for at least 24 hours without the use of fever or other medicines on symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and to inform employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sanitary windows and the installation of a sliding window for the customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk encompass the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of in-person meetings by virtual communications, the establishment of hand-held hours of protection, the interruption of non-essential travel to areas with an outbreak of disease of diseased workers, the replacement of in-person meetings by means of virtual communications, the provision of hand-held work hours, the provision of protection of personal information and protection for workers, and the provision of personal safety requirements for workers, the provision of attention and the risk of behaviour and the provision of attention to the environment, the environment, the safety and the safety of workers, the risk of the environment and the environment, the environment, the environment, the safety of the environment and the environment and the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment and the environment, the environment and the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment and the environment, the environment and the environment and the environment, the environment and the environment and the
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the sick from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with mussels when he is coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other disposable items must be removed in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and the contaminated areas must be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include the postponement of the journey in case of illness and the self-insulation and immediate information of the medical centre on board if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare, the CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has gone to a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education courses or canteen meals, by increasing space between offices, by staggering arrival and exit hours, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of a major transmission into the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement forces carrying out daily routine activities, immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact individuals with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a household cleansing wipe or spray and follow the standard procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE, as well as the containment and washing of clothing.
The OSHA considers certain health workers and funeral workers to be belonging to high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known CVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or sampling or handling of patients with suspected or known CVID-19.
Procedures producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies with VOC-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they exercise autopsies. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOC-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-COV-2 infection and for those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or superiors must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including medical adaptation, training and examination.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as VOC-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by the screening staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in its care, the use of PPE needed for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE, and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

DATE/HEURE OF ENVOI : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have toward each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of community empathy, cooperation and strengthening at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud of all of you to be among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed to me their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, that you maintain the operational sites, make sure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make significant adjustments in how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and time employment in the days and months ahead.
During this discussion, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We were primarily concerned with eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
All staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our goal of daily working time will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until new order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at present, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run errands, or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or sick leave required: simply warn your superior and help your team review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at COVID-19, please warn Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and make sure your situation gets the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced it, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our sub-contractors and our colleagues on the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to escape their stress related to the world around us.
What we do may be incredibly rewarding, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Security & Fund Collection (among others) teams carry out essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, and we will just focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to \"work twice more to catch up on the lost time\" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to do overtime to meet time constraints now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new objectives and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their relatives while adapting to those who need or wish to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines greatly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we confirm it.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a location in WeWork, which shared with us and all the staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our regular colleagues on distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to meetings of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over a number of days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make collective notes).
Send an electronic mail to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for snacks.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team studies ergonomic guidelines based on webinaries to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edict-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in case of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for later, the CRT is working to create a page on Méta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation affects all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
By now you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information in the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the RTC.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison as appropriate.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandoning our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and our obligations will probably need to be adapted in an unprecedented manner.
These steps are what we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help he needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our expected work will be here until the time comes.
For now, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that's why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to give the best of yourself the time to come.
Finally, if you please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metalloenzyme containing zinc at the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 field of N-terminated peptidease and an area of C-ending renal amino acid transporter collection.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, whose active enzyme domain is exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shedddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane mainly to cells in type II pulmonary alveoli, enterocytes in the grele intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells in smooth muscles in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 RNA is also present in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
The ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the amino acid phenylamine to carboxyle ending of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleavage several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghreline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the SARS origin virus) ; and SARS-COV-2 (the virus of the origin of the VOC-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 S1 protein to the enzyme domain of the ACE2 to the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This input process also requires the initiation of S protein by the host serine protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 is currently the subject of investigation as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the control of infection.
However, a number of professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment be continued with the use of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 demonstrated that \"the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.\"
In addition, \"the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular stroke victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia.\"
The converting enzyme of human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is felt as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people (\"contacts\") likely to be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in some jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with COVID-19 carriers.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided in open source and will be returned to the government. North Macedonia has launched \"StopKorona!\", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracing of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicating with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the use of contact tracing was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (\"StopCovid\").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to put in place applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geo-repair application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only authorizes \"official\" or generally trustworthy organizations to add applications related to the coronavirus to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Activists in favour of privacy protection have expressed concern about the implications of coronary virus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to cope with the coronaryvirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have established eight conditions to be met in government projects:
surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extensions of control and monitoring should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of the control of VOC-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in cases of abuse;
The \"significant participation\" of all \"interested stakeholders\" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the mechanism for tracking the operating system of their devices as soon as necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy concerns.
However, all central server-based systems do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercom, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made localization information accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of the profound changes made to the privacy protection laws of the information after the MERS epidemic affecting that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, including low energy (BLE) Bluetooth technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordinating effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols encompass Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all correspondence is carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper \"Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic\" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a private life protection technology company originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and primarily equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and to ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the BlueTrace protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate low energy Bluetooth technology and cryptography with confidentiality.
They also published the specifications for basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools for governments to create official privacy-related kronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and by deleting it later in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a drug (also referred to as reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change in the therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a VOC-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-COV-2 has approximately 66 target therapeutic proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, papaine-type protein, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose phosphate is found.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimised and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be one of the four drugs studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that \"the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-VO-2 infection\" has not yet been established.
Doctors indicated that they use this medicine \"when there is no other option\".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “clearly effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence for the medicinal product is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the medication to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the medicine. The medication may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to breed.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that \"no benefit was observed\".
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind with the SARS-COV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Trial.
Remedesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remedesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phylovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by University hospitals in Cleveland; one conducted on people suffering from moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for those who are hospitalized and seriously ill with VOC-19; two controlled against locusbo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial on the alvesco (cyclésonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a phase II test is under way with 200 patients to recruit among severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of CVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who have been diagnosed positive at COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients and study the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of VOC-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Humifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as VOC-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many developmental attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-COV-2, a virus that caused the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I security study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak occurred around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEP scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects early in 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenoviral Vector Type 5)
As CEP scientists said in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development, 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (supposed in planning or design).
A phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against the placebo and carried out in several centers, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecularly clamped vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it started working on a vaccine, whose human testing was expected to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with her partner in biotechnology, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On 25 March, the Director of the Research Institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he had started a vaccine to create a peptide-based Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in man \"within 90 days\".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced its plan to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced to join Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they worked on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently being investigated in the laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that American President Donald Trump had offered CureVac \"strong sums of money to gain exclusive access to the VOC-19 vaccine,\" which sparked the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an RNA-based vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on RNAm BNT162 is currently in preclinical testing with the onset of clinical trials due in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienne, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 at US$29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of a CVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence to China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C for the development of a VOC-19 vaccine with projects for the creation of a national \"vaccin bank\" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that \"the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits administered by micro-nails triggered a significant response from specific antigen antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.\"
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce inoffensive particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is planned to include 4 170 health professionals.
Developmental vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as ACE-2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and human efficacy.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There are no vaccines tested against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could be used as a model to develop vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines were in progress; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one VAM vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks broadcast a theory of the plot that the virus originating in COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While most cases lead to moderate symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus is spread mainly when it comes to close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
As these droplets are produced on expiry, they usually fall on soil or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by affecting a contaminated surface, then by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
The general public's recommendations on the port of the mask vary, some authorities discourage their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow or throat pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have a symptom is currently unknown and under study. Korean Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both exposure and saliva can carry important viral loads.
Speaking loudly frees more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patients' chambers produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about seed propagation, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you don't know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, a person usually pollutes two to three others. The virus survives hours and even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the lipid protective layer of the virus, which disables it and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the onset of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia linked to Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by VOC-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the type II cell alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called \"spicule\" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions have been reported in 12% of those admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, however acute myocardia lesions may also be related to CEA 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with CVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. The autopsies of deceased patients of VOC-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epithelial cells of the airways that express the ACE-2, patients with severe CVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with CVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal sampling or exposure may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two two weeks apart blood samples and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop, independently, chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test nearest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan hospital Zhongnan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and on epidemiological risk.
Opacities in multi-lobar bilateral depoli glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of VOC-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia in the course of healing: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding hot spots, frequently washing hands and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a tissue in public places, in order to limit the transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by stopping schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling the important groupings of people.
Distances also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called \"plating the curve\".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends that a disinfectant solution be used for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for the hands of trade are not available, WHO offers two formulae for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not \"an antiseptic active substance for hands\".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that suspected carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a lifestyle and a healthy diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful in those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients for VOC-19.
Resuscitation and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IPCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen on the front-line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, in particular in conditions of care where procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
In addition to standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for air transmission, the CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPP, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (face masks) are preferred.
Respiratory masks N95 are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or ultimately craft masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized patients. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level airways.
It is unknown whether either or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of VOC-19 serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of those hospitalized with CVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The research for potential start-up treatments in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs is the subject of clinical trials.
Remedesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug may be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescents as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identifier.
The application is able to detect \"close contacts\" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Analytics of massive data on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel enabled security agencies to locate mobile phone data of suspected individuals to have the coronavirus.
The aim of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera said that he was informed by mobile telephone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move”.
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor stating, \"increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm mental health and people's well-being.\"
The disease may have moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases generally recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection according to data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress towards a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with CVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of the cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment being observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with CVID-19 have a high rate of hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Commission on Chinese Health (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples present diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Commission on Chinese Health, heart injuries due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undernumber of moderate cases may result in an over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases previously contracted may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of CVID-19 and have a 2.4-fold higher risk of starting in intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns also arose regarding the long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong has observed a fall of 20% to 30% of the respiratory capacity in some patients cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in sick people.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of the other coronaviruses, but cases of patients cured of CVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and animal-based, by the spread of the infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively conducted by a human to human transmission.
A study of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the pathological emergency codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die from an illness.
These statistics are not limited over time and are followed by a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among men fifty-year-olds, the difference between men and women disappearing only at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The specific reasons for this gender gap are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of them.
Immunological gender differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women and development among men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than among women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of CVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with the international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes VOC-19 is called coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses \"COVID-19 virus\" and \"COVID-19 virus\" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as \"coronvirus\".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called \"coronvirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional 2019-nCov disease names and acute 2019-nCOV respiratory disease for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as drains and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency breathing valve and the supplier could not supply it in due time, a local startup retroconceived and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new CVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven tests evaluated approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on meddesivir in several countries whose reports are expected in late April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug candidates against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remedesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remedesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with meddesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some request an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation to the discretion of doctors caring for patients of COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with the transmembrane serine 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin present major limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of VOC-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at subsequent stages of the VOC-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-choke properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 non-randomized at the national level in Italy is being tested after having shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to result in the death of some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the steroid refractory cytokines relaxation syndrome induced by a different cause, the treatment with CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of individuals who have cured CVID-19 to people who need it is under study as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which the passive treatment of antibodies can generate a defence against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, e.g. using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients cured and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
