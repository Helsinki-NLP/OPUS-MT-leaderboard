Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are married and
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, namely MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Wales Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is abstaining with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Gallian readers: in Welsh, the word ‘twp’ means ‘obtuz’ and ‘spwp’ and means faecal ‘feccal’.
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that, overall, the group was delighted and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Conservative Party stated that the group has an \"open and changing name\" attitude, but that it also observed that \"MWP and resembles \"Muppet\"
In this context, the letter ‘saw’ is pronounced in Wales as it is in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: “The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves and
The Act of 2017 on the Government of Wales provided the Assembly with the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found that many of them wanted to use the Galilean Parliament and
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred members of Parliament in Wales and or ‘WMP’ but the “MWP” option and received the most votes in public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones the President of the Management Committee, who is expected to send the bill on changes over a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee's system.
Members of the National Assembly will have their final word with regard to their titles when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
On this Sunday, citizens with voting rights will express their opinion on the change in their country's name to the Republic of Macedonia of the North and
The popular vote was organized to resolve an old dispute for decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite vehement opponent on the change of name, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells stopped beating as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
“Historically, veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you were finding a bar and a church on every corner of the street and Adams said.
“Today, there are no bars and no churches
He also said that bar disappearances are understandable.
\"People socialize differently today and he said.
“Wars no longer have the role of a living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather and
And as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of the goods will be spent faster than the leaders are expected and that, even sooner or later, the denouncing will be the same.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white and he said, ‘This will therefore speed up the closure of churches, as it is also likely that many of the people who move into these buildings will become members of the churches concerned and
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-Americans and the Metropolitan St. Martin Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted 125th Street merchants, a main street intended for Harlem shopping, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's enormity made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, called the ‘Clopoto’ of the poor
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: a cultural treasure and a historical instrument of non-replacement and
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that he was the first carilon in the world acted by an African-American musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger cariron at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the ruling entity of the parish, made up of the deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese was looking to pass the costs and to the sacrament, even if it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enormous people complained about the lack of transparency he had given diocese evidence of.
A shark injured a 13-year-old who was trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child while swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 in the morning, near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV post in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends in the morning of Saturday when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved next to a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel once said that initially he thought the boy was delighted that he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he screamed at me!
He bit me and
The whole clavicle was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: “There’s a shark in the water, and Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not kept.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim was traumatized in the upper part of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen his position on the UK's feed and fashion market
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making it possible to provide bays with fruit products in the style of a universal store, with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the UK landlocked products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not in the best position, the larger districts with fruit and vegetable products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the following year, if they prove to be successful.
Investments in the beauty industry come in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the Sainsbury reteller said that the number of feed products they offer will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also revives its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being the first open week last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury, said that the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, as supermarket chains are trying to do the same with large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury included both products from Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats, since he acquired both chains two years ago, which means that he recorded increases in food sales and increased profits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to re-heat its compartments of pharmaceuticals and fruition has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations stopped after a disagreement on how Boots' revenues were shared in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, the company Celesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our rayon with fruition products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations transform us into an extraordinary location to purchase fruit products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases and
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract
The protagonist of the TV show and the Dragons' Den and Peter Jones, is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his life-style company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Ptrew.
The presenter of the show \"This Morning and 37 years old,\" announced on Instagram that he will withdraw.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the protagonist of the “Dragons‘ Den and retiring at the last moment in their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved TV people recognized Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, no longer allow them to dedicate their brands, Truly, which include accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Ptrew's Goop brand and would almost have doubled Willoughby's wealth, with an estimated £11 million.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that he would quit the contract for Truly, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
Statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It had to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw has shocked everyone.
Nobody came to believe what happened on Tuesday, was still there until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold and
The experts believe that the withdrawal of the presentationer of the show ‘This Morning and which are among the best selling celebrities in the UK, could bring to the company the damage of millions, as a result of investments in products such as candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay in the launch.
It can also represent the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand base together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the show and I'm A Celebrity and ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was really tough, and then I knew we were in love and
He made jokes about the criticisms he will receive from the journalists because he made a comment that some would consider to be in a state of mind and that he has such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump's president make such a big step back?
He said Trump was mimicking a news speaker voice .
\"I didn't step back and
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the whole world at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had not observed an adequate response from the United States to the previous disarmament efforts of North Korea.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on that.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
\"Everything goes well with North Korea and he said.
\"We need to head for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship and
He also said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: the cessation of rocket tests, the support offered for the release of hostages and the return of the American military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a city, but if you behave like that, instead of the 10,000 outsiders, who try to get into this impatient arena, you would be around 200 people and told Trump, pointing to the lot that is in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, resulting in the death of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, a national disaster was not declared, a necessary condition for the launching of aid actions at international level.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about the fact that they do not require international assistance, so it is a difficult situation and Sumbung said.
Although the Foundation “Save Children and Try to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not known yet if foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be prepared insufficiently for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often found on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate and more this.
A hospital ship that has stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvements to Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the central point of his electoral campaign and allocated money with haste for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko is also facing persistent pressure from the sects of Indonesia, because members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim bands have squabbled on the streets, using machetes, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the lifesaver goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea

The ball reached over which, pointing to the top right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell in the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get ahead as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible and told Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball away and
Chelsea drove 1-0 to rest after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in minute 25.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned in the middle of the field and ran to the half-field of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the land.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered it.
Hazard went over defense and sent the ball to the net, managed to hit her with his left leg and get past the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team in the leagues of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by changes in the rewriting of history
The removal of it would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of both the cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatic puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as a little crazy and a little attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate about the removal of the statues as the figure of Oliver Cromwell from outside Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, realized by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that I believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered to be president, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable individual figure, which represents part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the family \"Youan and was found dead after he was sectioned an artery and was covered with blood, near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he came with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to a nearby elbow was open.
He said that in quotas there was a male pig of large blood dimensions in his mouth.
The forensic doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
\"My cousin's hair was full of blood and broken and said the cousin, whose family name is \"Wu and for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Eveing News that the pig was shut down to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities negotiate compensation for its death.
Although they are rare, there have been reported cases of pigs that have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions and
\"Simply plays.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect and he said it.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost her intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located at about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it has started to form a depressive area across the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring the precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the next few days.
Local, rainfalls between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residue streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation levels up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevadei and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm in the south-east is expected, especially in most of the Arizones.
There may be rapid flooding due to the conditions of rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
The heavy rain could cause the canyons to be turned into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds to the brim and dust.
The depressed area approaching will bring torrential rains to areas on the southern coast of California.
There are possible precipitations of nearly 2 cm, which could result in smaller streams of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region, in the wet season.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of the day of months, before the rain will spread more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitations will spread into the so-called ‘four corners and Tuesdays’ and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature will occur in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic differences in temperature are encountered in the central area of the USA.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the extended summer heat will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern U.S. area will face a hot beginning of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain parts of the northeast.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates higher chances of temperatures over average for eastern USA by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting the normal Friday program for a final win: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to have the FBI conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford said in front of the judge's committee that it's 100% certain that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it's 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have attended the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble contrived the people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinionaries strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million, and CNN of 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was in the middle of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning while the protesters shouted at him and he was trying to climb into a lift at a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people fought him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
\"I'm right here, in front of you and said a woman.
\"Do you think he tells us the truth?
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are powerless and
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast their live vote within the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for vote by the Senate.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by minority democracy.
Flake was largely convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and with several senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, obviously the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of political games and on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of political games and the future of Great Britain and of undermining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, attended the conference of the Conservative Party of Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, and the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the European Union collect their reciprocal tariffs was completely ridiculous and

A volcano threw a ashes column over the city of Mexico City
Cinderella from the volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after the activity in the crater began and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several screams and vibrations.
The images on social networks presented thin layers of ash on car windshields in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.

Conflict between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters fought with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, gathering thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of pro-separate and masked and distant from the gendarmes bombed these eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The raid was intensified later, using the batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups scanned, “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive and while the protestors of the union shouted, “Bring Spain and Spain.
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen, in an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voting participation has been low, and those against secession have largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region, with violent charges taking place.
Pro-independence groups have camped overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
\"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we don't have what to do and he said.
Despite a vital but tight victory in the December regional elections last year, the Catalan pro-independant parties tried to maintain the momentum this year, many of the most well-known leaders living either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his protest phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
\"The situation gets more and more tense and he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run the elections for the European Parliament next year.
\"As a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression I saw from the Spanish government and he said.

Looks like at some point a gun was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left Rangers without a reply, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in Premier League this season and faces Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers host the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in the division until six games, Holt's main coach still feeling the taste of defeat, because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team was supposed to move forward long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and tried to win over the port space, then Alan Lithgow managed to win wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The Gazde have thanked them to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors trouble at their free kicks.
And that was how the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who won and scored from the center of which.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the porter Liam Kelly was no longer greatly disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second recovery, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was not successful with Allan McGregor at Rangers, and Lithgow had a big blow from another player on the Livingston team.
The diagonal steps continued to come in which the Livingston team, but without success, and the two criminal applications - after Halkett stormed Glenn Middleton and after a letter - were not accepted.
“Fenomenal game and offered by Livingston and analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on a ascending trajectory.
Their game style and team haven't changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be granted to Holt for the way he's trained his team since taking it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they have had good performances since they were led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Joint reaction to Erdogan's visit to Köln
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to get breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy the relations between NATO and NATO.
They are unhappy because of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
Police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered enough supporters nearby to see your information.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, the Kurdish majority, made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor as a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies from collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an agglomerated street in Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the crash site, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place just a few months after another biker died from an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from the place where the Saturday accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said the officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The access is restricted in that area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcycles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a breach
Six prison officers were injured following a breach at a high-security prison for men, said one prison representative.
On Sunday, a battle started at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30, which is ongoing.
Specialized officers have been brought in to deal with the struggle, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated in front of the spot for minor injuries to the city.
A spokesperson for the prison said: “The assistance of the specialized prison staff was requested to deal with an incident in progress at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after being injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after grace
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous and criminal in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the officers who deal with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by Hurricane Rosa (sectose areas can enjoy benefits as a result)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the South-West, presenting a rapid flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of the Arizone, south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct path to Phoenix on Tuesday, and the second day of months will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a message on Twitter that only six tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of about 320 km and Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km and border with Arizona
The latest models of the National Centre for Uragane forecast precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Bazin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the rapid flood risk, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in certain areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drying Monitor, over 40% of Arizona is facing at least one severe drought, the second largest category and information available onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce land slips in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of months.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high flood risk.
“The torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm and Baja California to the north-west of Sonora are expected, and can reach 25 cm and according toweather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north to Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, north-west of Sonora and the desert in the south-west of the United States and said a representative of the National Centre for Uragane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring streams of waste into deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, at approximately 4pm.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18 years old and one 20 years old, was arrested last night in Radstock, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officers asked for help from citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, and from them, to report to the police stations.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was faced with the hunger and anger of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the unsuspecting and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party and told Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh had faced the title and anger of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's statements about sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her claims.
The president said on Saturday that the American “people saw on that day the genius, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation and told the supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of republican presence in the mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not running, but somehow, I'm running and he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion on the candidates I consider to be outstanding and
Trump argued that democracy is on a mission of sorcery and obstruction
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place on Friday at the latest, a GOP driver's assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, number being safe
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at the amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims and told Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami has brought cars, tools, houses, hitting everything on the land and said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled in wide range at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
He added that some people were forced to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the lines continued to rock the town on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the heavy Friday earthquake was about 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb from Hiroshima from the Second World War.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, must have intensified the extent of the tsunami, added its representative.
Nugroho described the damage as widespread and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he also said, in addition to the 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho said victims and damage could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were completely disrupted, without any information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There they live more than 300,000 people and said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse and worse.
On Saturday, the Agency was criticized harshly for not reporting that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In the posts on social networks, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall hits the moor, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major disruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army began sending freight planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centres for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff from Donggala reached the city of Palu, where employees are staying in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed over devastating scenes, said Doseba.
He added: \"They told me they saw many houses destroyed and
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to initiate relief actions in the event of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel can reach the place of production of a calamity only if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level and said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“When the government says: “Yes, this is a national disaster and we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced.”
After the second night of the earthquake and the Friday tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the disappeared hoped that loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a channel.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been under ruins for two days with her mother's body next to it.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
\"In view of my experience in paragliding activity, I have my own emotional burden and said it.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the broadcast of the Roa Roa hotel crashing in the community of paragliding sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp contestants from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there was only one gray steak, and not two blue steaks.
\"I think that means that the messages were not transmitted and he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 during the feeding of a Newport banker on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied a ATM from the amusement complex and was preparing to transport less money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man kept running behind the employee Brink and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the communication, the witnesses observed fewer suspects who fled from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity is asked to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.

It made the announcement on Saturday about the change on Twitter: \"The individual officially known as Kanye West\"

This change comes before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he expects to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled for reasons of emotional nature and mentioned the broadcast manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious significance for him.
“I believe that science is most often found word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means myth and said West earlier this year, in the talk about the title of the Big Boy radio host album.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from \"Kanye and that means the only one, and it has reached \"Ye and this is a reflection on our good things, evil, unclear and all.

And a former collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with crater, sometimes without, as well as with large letters.
Mexico President Promises Not to Use Military Forces Against Civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military forces against civilians, with the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the army to punish the Mexican people.
The troops fired a peaceful demonstration on the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lure young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing for the IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount that it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after fewer members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if an official strategy for artificial intelligence is missing in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Dubling the budget for IA research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind and the US so we are looking for the next discovery of IA and Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of AI would be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order and was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later was the CEO at Microsoft Research and the presidents of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of U.S. governments in technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, and asked when to be next, to help identify the next victories.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
“Not China puts beer in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations and said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired notable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S.A. to step up its efforts.
\"I think you should automatically offer your doctoral visas in AI and he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Development Plan of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the American Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called ‘NextAI’.
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in the laws of the United States aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote at the referendum if they want to change the country name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the \"Republic of North Macedonia\" and a change that would resolve an old dispute over a decade with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June as to the new name proposed, but the national opposition leaders argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign cast doubt on the presence of the vote, possibly not reaching the minimum limit of 50%, required for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: “I agree with EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece and NATO.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the break-up of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us and Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state electoral commission said that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when 66% of the voting rights were put to the vote.
“I came to the vote for my children and for our place in Europe and said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
\"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the upper forehead, and not on the back door and said Kavadarkov.
\"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Euro-Asian Union and
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the much needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think most of them will be in favour of the name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU and Zaev said after expressing his vote.
He said that a result in favor of the name change would be ‘confirming our future’.
According to a survey published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants needed.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the presence of the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-vestigation policy since the takeover of the government in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to get past the Brighton team defense and won the Manchester City team victory on Saturday with 2-0 on the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in minute 65.
Argentinian attacker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three Brighton defensive players before he got to the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to cross a defender, and then outnumbered fewer players to the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a step left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right leg, managed to avoid the Brighton carrier, Matthew Ryan, with a hold to the right side of the door.
“Aguero is facing a few foot problems and told reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team.
\"I talked to him and I agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he scored a goal at that time and
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azures in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th.
Aguero took a deep step on Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a pass on his left flank.
Sane drifted the balloon a few times until she sent a bird to Sterling, who sent it in the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball to the net right before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the group phase on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the damage in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there is still involvement in play-off for Rockies, who have an advantage with a game of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies have obtained at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team on Friday evening, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
“Even if we’re not playing for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, along with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?
The national team has not yet announced the player that will open the game on Sunday, but according to the sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game by number 34, had a heating session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington media has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 hits in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation concerning the taking of a decision by the Supreme Court on Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of republican presence in the mid-term elections.
\"All our effort is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big ones, I don't run, but I actually run, which is why I try to back up the good candidates and he said.
Trump continued: “You see this awful, radical group of democracy, you see what's going on right now.
And I am determined to take the power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it to them.
He also said that democracy is on a mission of resilience and obstruction and
And you know you can see that in the last four days and he also said, describing democracy as angry and evil, vicious and lying.
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who is a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, who has been forcibly abducted by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait and that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
Persons who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised by the fact that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censorship as far as I am concerned.
After all, I'm just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my Parliament colleague, received a similar treatment because she was Vehement with regard to anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion was critical to my address because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn's statement.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, concerning which Jeremy did not have a common opinion with previous leaders.
Communication for the Friday meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive and
For most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place this way, and the promise of a much better, milder political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things began to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision in politics began to expect to change my thinking and to agree with some things that I had not agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, I follow a wave of abuse on socializing networks that demand my elimination from the party, reporting center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination given to my colleagues who are facing sexual abuse or racism, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly more flexible on this issue.
Many people have recommended me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything was fine and so.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, I was motivated by the fact that the negligence that the Thatcher government has shown led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including at the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that I am unclear to him about the policy and issues I disagree with in relation to the current leadership.
People who have supported the Friday motion can only tell them that, in the context of the country heading to Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, they do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty and the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have somewhat influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive game today in Tennant's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything came to their best defense, as well as the fact that they took advantage of more of the opportunities that emerged, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
“We have been subjected to more tests during our games so far and we continue to be invincible, so I must be happy and he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merit is given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we know.
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, granted him an advantage of the Ayr team, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to sign up, and then managed to turn an individual test, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second very well retake, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes because of Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, which was removed from the field with the targa, and since the game started again, Ayr was released through the attempt of the Climo-transformed Stafford McDowall player.
Captain Ayr's team, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed Bruce Colvine test at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he plated Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to march, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the test, as he did it again near the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a kick-box move and sent Gregor Henry extremely deep for the fifth host team try.
View of the sitcom “Still Game and seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, star of the sitcom \"Still Game\" and he seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after finding out that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing with his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the new one, will be the last one, and it looks like Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the developing industry of restaurants and
“The sea is ours and: the island of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling a naval headquarters full of macaroni in La Paz.
Public buildings tree the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get it back.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit at sea, the memory of a coastline lost in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still life just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in the last decades, as Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary appeal, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive vision and told Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on the large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia and that, after decades of firm discussion, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic and Bolivian one who faces a controversial struggle for the restoration of the coming year and also has much to gain from the decision of Monday .
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean and promised him at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's so likely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, so it would change too many things if it happened.
The United Nations Organization within the Netherlands does not have the power to give Chile its territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case has not been complicated and said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in causing it, but it is possible that the last four years would have given it back.
\"The problem of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, and Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean goodwill and residual, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after that.
The two countries haven't traded since 1962.
Former Edward Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
The Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to win ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements and he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales and one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America and used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bolivia will never relinquish the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean and he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get past and
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, said that his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri talked about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is unrealistic to say that the sanctions continue and the United States' objections in terms of declarations concerning the end of the Korean war will ever make the territory of the north to give in.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne have hit participants in the Fashion Week of Paris, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections.
The hats of no practice have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent the creations that steal the eyes on the podium.
The creation resistance piece, made by Valentino, was an extravagance, beige-colored hat, with a large bor, like a penis, in which the heads of the models were sunk.
Other oversized accessories have included peppers adorned with apples, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bullies, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had elbowed lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high seams.
One of the creations seemed to be a dive equipment, having a tube of oxygen and glasses, while another seemed to be a molten ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of dress with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
The stylists predict a return of the huge dolls in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats return after the hat appeared at the Bomba and the straw hat with a wide bor, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat to practice that has appeared on all social networks has caused another oversized creation on the podium, that is, the type of straw for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
Orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the 2019 spring-summer collection’s resistance track and Jacquemus’s Riviera and the Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the hats and beach genres oversized in the luxury stores next summer, because the fashion maker had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories and
John Edward: Language Competences, Essentials for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results on examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can conceive and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and desired for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to them in his own language, words reach his heart and
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that schools independent from Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are similar to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the employers were assigned a language skills shortage because of the reasons they were given for the struggle to fill vacancies.
Increasingly, therefore, linguistic skills become imperative for young people to prepare for their future career.
With many job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future, having such a ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
Having more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have higher opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages of choice within independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, however the future would be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as international communication skills and
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done (Treasure).

LeBron will debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost safe for fans who want to see LeBron James as he debuts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers team coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday pressure on Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to settle.
“There will be more than one and less than 48 and said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six games program in the press.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the pressure to prepare and he said.
Time of Trump's Western Virginia election rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate chosen by him for the free seat of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wishes to strengthen his support for future elections in the middle of the term, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's Western Virginia election rally take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can online track Trump's electoral rally in West Virginia through the video live stream below, on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate at the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense because of the inappropriate sexual behaviour charges, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, for the FBI to investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, to gain a little ground.
Thus, those of President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five rallies next week is to energize volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives and according to Reuters.
\"Congress control is so important for its programme that the countries will travel as many states as possible before entering the highly crowded campaign season and told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the Pittsburgh media and according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the elections at a difference greater than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to drive him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey and said Simon Haeder, a cop at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The Ryder 2018 Cup: US team gives proof of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple trials starting on Sunday
After three clear dominated sessions, it is possible that the Saturday afternoon foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The constant oscillating slope of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players even believe in it, all the more in the case of competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
\"They were driving us with six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're counting on this decrease for a little motivation and said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game starts to change in their favor and that there are enough encouragement reasons, among which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those hives of celebration became more and more noisy as the advance round, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score to equality in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driving two points after the first two holes.
The blow that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has chances.
\"You just have to focus and worry about just your own game and say Spieth.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The odd, but adorable couple of Europe won four of four games and it seems they can't fail.
“Moliwood and was the only pair that did not need any additional hit Saturday afternoon, but this claim is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine points of Friday morning.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would lead to good and a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun will set over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Debates on the glory of the Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly from Sergio Garcia, the morning hero to the Fourballs test, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sunk the Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they weren't even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and furnaces are fascinating and deserve to be followed almost by interaction between pairs, data and uncertified tips and how a strategy can be modified on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is motivated to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing the four-balls and Saturday ovens with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of an hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning's fourballs test and won the show with score 3 to 1.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice that has four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a couple called Molliwood and after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair that contains four points of the four opening games throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs test, they were superbly supported to defeat the disheartening Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a score even more clearly, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius eclipses, but so far lost 19 of the 29 games at the fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's furballs session, returned with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes test and defeated 2-1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe has not, however, had an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, major tournament tripler, and Justin Thomas became the American stage, winning two Saturday points.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then returned later and defeated the Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in the foursome test, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple, although, because they are current trophies holders, Furyk's players just need an equal result.
However, after being on second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no chance of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen confidence in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that significant amounts have been implemented in North Korea to prove its good faith last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and rocket testing, dismantling the nuclear testing location and non-proliferation commitment to nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any appropriate US response and he said.
“If we can’t trust the US, we won’t trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can’t disarm unilaterally first
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's opposition to a well-established approach and denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it step by step, its statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Unit and Donald Trump in a front-end summit between U.S.-based units and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to make progress towards a ‘Denuclearation of the Korean Peninsula’ while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States said that the Phenian must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not pursue demands for the relaxation of harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the “first denuclearisation” option and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, but even objects against “the declaration of the conclusion of the war” and Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel to us is an illusion that only people who don’t know us know us.
But the problem is that long-term sanctions deepen our confidence and
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader referred to at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the President of South Korea, for the past five months, adding: “If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse and
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to collect the US territory with missiles from North Korea after Mr. and Mr. Malifier and Trump called Kim a nightmare and a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year North Korea with total destruction and praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but indicated that work was just beginning and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no planned time for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be paid by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said the following Thursday for the UN Security Council: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorous and uninterrupted until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation and
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for the nuclear and ballistic missiles of the Phenian.
Pompeo met Ri in the colors of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress was made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced that he had made gang threats and
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States is taking appropriate amounts and
He said that Kim told him that the appropriate amounts he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the culture of the macho and in the city that makes them subject to learning sessions all night and energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that often students of the world's most prestigious universities do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the US.
It was inspired to create the course after it held a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, “Why do you say this to me just now in the last year?”
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me and said it to The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains students the key concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that takes an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a home room, and students can click on coffee dogs, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
And we know we can't change student behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking are on health and added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says this, adding that modern technology and the increasingly imposed pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a problem in the city.
Enough sleep, of a good quality, should be secret alarm and a student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said it, but even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study program before joining this institution where the competition is acute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of blue light and emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can upset the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal drops Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of depression in motion because Dolly Menga's hit sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first victory in the move from the 4-1 triumph won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the Ladbrokes Primeship's authoritarian leaders.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players at Rangers didn't seem to be able to match at all.
Rangers thus fell to the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed the third place, behind the Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers may also face other problems, because the referee of you knows Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown from the lawn of the visiting team fans.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easily against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used those 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and had all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated opponents during the game.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had.
He should've walked just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first pass drove Scott Pittman to the defense gate of Allan McGregor, but the middle city missed a very good occasion.
A deep, free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over, but they left the impression that more hope than confidence in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed only two hits on the front gate, but the former porter on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the goal of the 34th minute of Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, either for the effort alone.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep concentration of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, who kept his calm and cared for Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave wheels right away, when he really focused on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the buttons to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of game he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have extended its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent with his head on the side of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at Rangers, demanded a penalty for the end of the match, when he hit Jacobs but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and CONTINUE count...), is the day that the physicist Johannes Wilhelm and Hans and Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has become essential for pop culture, as was the case in the film ‘Clopots of San Coronado and (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely inclination towards science:
Man: \"What are you doing?\"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these cones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from the radioactivity in minerals and
Evans: ‘Yes, I hear a lot of pimples.’
\"Hans and Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to detect harmful cells and cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and destroy harmful cells
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them into a laboratory
They can detect a common protein many cancers and then are reinjected.
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have to deal with a very promising vaccine and
HER2’s determination was to increase many types of cancer including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to teach them and to know cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe of Trump's support, while wearing a MAGA cap, after appearing at the SNL.
It didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was abducted in the studio during the Saturday Night Live broadcast after a loose performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist was released in a speech against democracy and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago and said he.
SNL began the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over the leg of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diatribe footage was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West's foot with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had trouble chasing because of his chess.
\"They tried to intimidate me in the cages.
They said, \"Don't come out wearing this hat.\"
I was assaulted!
They told me I got very low and he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see how far down I’ve come, and then he said that I’m going to catch Superman’s robe, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love and
His comments drew out of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from this team said to the publication: \"In the studio there was a full silence.\"
West was invited as a last-minute substitute for soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he played the song I Love is dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: I'm glad you've dealt with the crowd.
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply knew it himself and that's wonderful.
\"But I choose NOT to reward anyone (buying music or clothing or supporting art) about whom I believe to embrace and express a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we and she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on it is the science officially known as Kanye West and
He is not the first artist to change his name; West steps after Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed its name into a symbol and then into the artist previously known as Prince and
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is waiting for months in front of the Court of Belfast.
Charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Kingdom Hall, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the violent medieval fantasy series Trons Urzeal, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the hero macho stereotype, saying that the presentation of these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he seemed to know something wrong and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Trons Urzeal, Rose Leslie, who is still 31 years old, admitted that he is very determined to talk about this problem.
\"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about it now: where I wronged with masculinity, he wondered.
“What we have taught men about what to be like adults, given the problem we are now facing.”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do you teach young boys on TV and on the street, what makes them think it must be a certain kind of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our times: How can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong with young people has happened.
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Thrones Urge after the series ended in the summer of the coming year, saying that he was finished with the battlefields and horses.
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West play by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a villain.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the Trons' Urzeal series is that he met his wife, Rose.
\"I met my wife when I made this show, so that she assured me of my family's future and my life from now on and said Kit.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the fantasy series winning several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, say the Chinese health officials responsible for a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be very widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission come from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data to the Senators of the Republican Party, talking about dangerous crimes and conspiracy stereotypes and
Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team posted personal information on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of the six-thirty right
“Minds, lies and other miserable lies and told Waters in a post on Twitter.
The information disclosed included Senators' addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leaking of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie and continued Waters.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie and
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
\"This denial is angry and Fleischer wrote.
\"This suggests that he does not have the necessary temper to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be sharp.
You must not question the motive of the accuser.
You must be calm and quiet and
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by democracy, who said he seemed a little too angry during the Tuesday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the republican who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
\"Important, if it's true and he wrote it.
In his statement, Waters said that her office alerted the appropriate authorities and legal entities about these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered and continued, and that they will respond before the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: unplugged parody of spy films, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the Paris series of action films that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this deflowering satire be able to become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the eyes of the wild and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a comical creation for the cinematographic public in the non-speaking English countries.
He is, of course, the scrupulous secret agent who, despite his demands to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that kind that contributed with only one note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mystery man without country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE has one or two cute moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the wheel's blades easily hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is quite weak and, in a strange, superfluous way, especially because the sex films and such as those in the 007 series or impossible mission, offer confidently comical moments as an ingredient.
The humor seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's tragic adventures are not as smart and smart as Atkinson's silent movie gags when they play in Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of English agents undercover, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister pumped under siege, who is already suffering a severe crisis due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her character like Theresei May, but the scenario does not give her the chance to shine.
His secret information advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, and that an agent must be activated in reserve.
This is Johnny English's own zevzek, now working as a teacher in a high school, which teaches itself about how to be undercover agent. Here are some cute gagurs, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then it is reunited with his old-time partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of the creation of the confusion in His Majesty's Secret Service returns to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billion-dollar charismatic technology industry that claims to be able to solve the IT problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a rest of the bullies adventures: disguise in waiters, set fire to a French restaurant fashion, create chaos when stroking aboard Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers pure-shaped anarchies when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize itself with Volta's interior.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but whatever the cute and colorful film is, it seems like a television production for children.
A fairly mediocre film.
As in the case of the other movies with Johnny English, I cannot stop asking myself: can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a role to the extent of his talent?
The Labours deny that they plan the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party seems to want the company heads to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving them employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way in which workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the leadership of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “The Policy Review Announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration in addressing the economic rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.
The Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the President of the United Nations and of the profit-free and profit-making companies.
The plans of the chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-provider kings may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour Government may perceive and take deductions due to established offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers in companies' boards of directors and to create ownership funds to deliver 10% of the private sector's own capital to employees, which will thus receive annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on the 60-minute show and whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court at least one week and raises the question whether Republican senators might be convinced to no longer support him because of the FBI findings.
In a Sunday broadcast interview, correspondent 60 Minutes and Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
\"Of course you said Kennedy.
\"I said that from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up and I asked him, \"Are you guilty?\"
The answer was decided promptly, unequivocally and
Graham's vote, however, seems to be dug in the rock.
\"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so he would need some explosive charges and said.
“Mr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this: Brett resolutely rejects the charges and added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by it have confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt it'll change something and
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive group of stars will participate, with a mission as impressive as the elimination of world poverty.
Reaching the seventh edition, the Global Citizen's Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket at the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making telephone calls or other significant things that would help increase awareness of the global poverty elimination key.
But what success did the Global Citizen Festival have when it's only 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade them to act or is it just another case of ‘clicktivism’ and concept that concerns people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million hits have been recorded since 2011, and its supporters have promoted different goals.
The organization says that these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account where at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with UK headquarters of investors and intermediaries who have committed to help children grow to their full potential and who promised to provide Rwande 35 million dollars to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after having received more than 4500 Twitter messages from global citizens.
“With the help of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history and said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of me during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty and
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who will play at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces for a lock-up and hinder Russia's energy exports, the Secretary of the Interior declares
Washington may, if it is necessary and to appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason I’m in the Middle East is that I want to broker the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe and said it.
And, according to the official, there are ways to manage the situation.
\"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come out on the market and he said.
Zinke addresses participants to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that called itself the energy consumer and the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of coal, and he said about Russia that it contains only one trick because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations come at a time when Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas in Europe to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump's representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the \"inadequate\" project and North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a \"prisoner\" and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline project that will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kremlin said that the fierce opposition of the US and the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers and said Aleksandr Novak, the Minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticisms from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industry in Germany (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in matters of our energy and said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, being very serious and running for the presidential elections in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must be serious about himself and whether to run for presidential elections after the election in the middle of the term.
During the meeting at Holyoke City, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he considered a nomination.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that it takes a strong woman and she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously think about running for presidential elections and
Warren had something to say about Donald Trump's activities during the city hall meeting, saying that he had targeted the country in a wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy and she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said it was unusual that we needed an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' probable voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of well-known democracies that could be awarded in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator de Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome Track Palin suffers at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence
“The things that my own son is going through, through which he went after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the follow-up of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with and told the public gathered at a rally of support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called himself the arrest of his elephant in the room and said that her son and other war veterans had turned a little different, harder, turned away wondering whether there was respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, did for the country and
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and the possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states and the District of Columbia contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape violence caused by the cage or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District have completed a friendly request for a curiae Friday in Washington to support a dispute of the asylum-seekers policy, reports NBC News.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
This said that her partner and his violent sons, members of a gang, abused her, but the US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The lawyer appointed by the state representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a generalized problem with cages and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 Immigrant Appeals Council decision that allowed immigrants with no acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation and
“The Federal Law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such limitation violates this principle and is written in the request of friendly curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “furnish the necessary work”.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June the judges to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of the birds.
\"The asylum shall be granted to those who leave their country with persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion and declared Sessions on 11 June when it announced its policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly serious.
\"The situation seems very tense and said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who alienates her baby suffering from fever at a evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
\"Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient
The residents began returning to their homes destroyed and organizing their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were outnumbered.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated in the open air due to strong and continuous replics.
It has tears full of eyes when you remember how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room from the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
\"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe and said Haris for Associated Press, adding that his family was safe for a wedding.
\"I heard my wife when she cried for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're clear.
The US Ambassador accuses China of abusing and claiming propaganda
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between USA and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the 6 November elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
He accuses that Beijing is trying to get involved in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements in which they promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing commercial war involving waves of import tariff increases.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the commercial war, were created to affect exporters from countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the US.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and was governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In a Sunday editorial published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China \"continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press and
“By spreading propaganda by publishing a commercial in Des Moines Register, China’s government does not respect the tradition so prized in America of freedom of expression and of a free press and writes Branstad.
“In return, at the newspaper clot on the street here in Beijing you will find voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party and writes it.
He added that one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish his article, although he did not say what paper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before the mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
Because some of the top Republicans support him and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on several sexual abuse charges, the analysts warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially from women, during future mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
“The response scale will not be forgotten and Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last moment initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and will not look in November and said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors chanted \"November Friday and while demonstrating on the halls of the Senate when the republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mich reported.
“Enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be very large and said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst not participating in the news site.
\"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female voters who indecision from the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not like the fish, often do not vote the same.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that there might be a counter-reaction if the republicans continued the confirmation process.
\"This turned into a mess for the Republicans and said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just the vote on the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but also how the Republicans have treated this situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, an electoral support group of democracy, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the party they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little less they seem to believe in it.
A new survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe Ford's testimony is likely to have been true, while 35% said that they believe her very strongly or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her face while participating in a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to make Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is global domination and
\"Now we have to do it and he talked about startup.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data files and or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available all in one browser, all of them at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this ‘personal consolidation by data and
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to \"Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change when their business models are completely out of date.
“We don’t ask them permission and
In a post published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid and
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet and added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrating
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack from Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he was awarded the highest military honor of Great Britain.
A commemorative stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two nieces during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said he was amazed by the symbolicity and that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin and printed it under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the first line and, with fantastic bravery and opened the way to the soldiers, then attacked a nest of artillery by himself and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I know I could never equal, but that makes me feel sloppy.
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him and
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you couldn't track the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, the British spectators were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all pleased, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to cartoon for children as a kind of stupid joke
\"Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 mornings, so they had to change to children's programs and said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
‘Penpa pig, yes
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will also schedule their events so that they can be tracked by the spectators of Britain.
\"When I think of replays, I think we might probably solve it and said Coker.
\"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer fans more and we exceeded the limit.
It's an unhappy situation
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of sexuality
Olympic skunker Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until when he got to school that not everyone is like me and
Guest on the first Desert Island Disc show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people's rights to give them other hopes and
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt inferior to others and because he was not socially acceptable to me to like boys and girls and
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt differently were the real things that gave me the power and the resistance to gain the success and
He wanted to prove that there was someone who told him, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live free, untracked, and because he wanted to give others hope and hope.
The world champion triplet said he was caught by surprise and falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the winning filmmaker of the Oscar award, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such an early age and take part in the first Olympics when she was only 14 years old, and her father died of cancer after three years,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his whole perspective and
“If I had been asked last year, I would not have been interested anything but to get a gold medal and said it.
And you know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie and
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to know was if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first place.
\"I couldn't tell him \"you can't be first, Dad\" and he said.
\"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and barely after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible and said he was.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
And I knew that at that I dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling and he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still thrills him.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday, 11:15 p.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed to the reserve bank on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and Saturday furnaces.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case for the United States team, the winner of the major tournaments has divided the day between being a cheerleader for teammates and exerting their blows, hoping that it will address what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the most right drives, not even in the best period of his career, and that is not the best choice for the narrow land at Le Golf National, where long oak areas often punish incorrect hits.
And if the ground isn't a big enough challenge, in the new Sunday Mickelson match will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous champion at British Open, who has allied himself with the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial for Americans, driving with four points at the entrance to the 12 simple games, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
\"She fully understood the role she had today, beat me on her shoulder, hugged me and told me she would be ready for tomorrow and said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't realize he was gonna play in two games.
I imagined more, but that happened and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else and
Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
\"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with players, he's a wonderful guy in the team locker room and he explained it.
\"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun seeing him do this during the week.
His role is more important, not just the game and
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but barely if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“I remember having a considerable advance to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we lost, and to Valderrama, where we barely managed to win and said Bjorn (pictured) after following how the team of 2018, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now drives 10-6 on Le Golf National.
\"So, history shows me, to me and my team, that's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the top shift.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on to the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, we know what's waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world and
Enchanted by the way his players managed in a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
There's a whole different situation tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and you have to play as well as you can.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with the partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was in the winning team from Brookline, then in the loser when Europe succeeded the Admiral from Medina and
And keep in mind every word and answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 Captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
\"We have 12 major games tomorrow and we'd like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in a direction, put a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We created the correct lot and ordered the players as we would like, and so, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow and
Thomas's task was drawn to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think they cover all the topics and said Bjorn about the simple test lot.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest naval forces had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to the fault and cost systems in the city, the local press reported.
The entry into operation of the ship \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" and the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which reads a military word bearer.
The vessel should have been introduced into maritime forces in 2014, but issues arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class rubies.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which ensures a low-lying, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new ones to be able to leave on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, continued delays mean that these warships of the last generation, which are said to increase the maritime forces of Germany, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 Freated Ghinionist was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Military Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of software and hardware and crucial failures that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest rubbed in the Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the vessel had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Military Navy to add future facilities.
It is believed that the 7,000 tons ship and Rheinland-Pfalz and is twice as hard as the vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the price of the whole project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said that it has reached an amazing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newer ones are of special importance given the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence commission, acknowledged that the Military Navy had begun to run out of vessels that could be sent to missions and
The officer said that the problem has steadily increased over time, as the old vessels have been removed from office without being replaced with some new ones.
He deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates went into operation within the Military Navy.
National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a Scottish Highlands property want to reveal how bats use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behaviour of these new flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze bats and bats of Pigma, as well as bats and bats of water in the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in key places around the property to track the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report, to create a detailed picture, on scale, of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grass, and which is the best way to maintain forest lands for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has fallen considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are the traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-locating technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously of bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control the nests and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bat are found in Scotland.
The management of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for bats.
\"Here, at Three, the area is great for bats and he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply
It underlines the importance of searching for bats before doing maintenance work on properties, because simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy all local populations.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disrupting their nests and destroying their nests are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer at Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
This said: “We still have a lot of learning about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species and
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are gossip news and that some people want to advertise and use his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of having raped a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, aged 33, said that they are gossip news and
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news and said the winning corner of the Golden Ball in front of the video camera.
\"I want to advertise you using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but they're used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine and added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called an inadmissible report of suspicions that lead to privacy and according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for equivalent moral damages with an adequate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years and
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to the documents submitted to the District Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was a good boy and in proportion to 99% and that he was betrayed by that percentage.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the complainant, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she approached the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but then accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was wiped out by the possibility of revenge and was concerned that some were humiliated by the public
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom regrets forever the loss of car manufacturers
Britain would regret forever and if it would lose the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
It added that it is worrying and that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
\"We need a deal and Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory and said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other car producers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the time-fixed principle and: for command-made machines, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU.
If Britain left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border problems could arise, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would stop.
Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May for future EU relations is accurately balanced to avoid these delays to borders and
\"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity and said it for today's BBC Radio 4.
‘Doubts from not only Toyota, but also from other producers, show that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set and
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and ultimately lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the factory, said that members are becoming more concerned: \"Experience has taught me that, after they disappear, these jobs never return and
A government spokesman said: “I have created a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU and
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
The high-level meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be won another week and because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's aid to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about the possibility of Trump firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in the circles of Washington for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the information through amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then held at United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump claimed he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested an FBI one-week investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which postponed the vote again in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “It has not been established once in this respect. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that now happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to get the current press and
Some reporters would object to this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy of TV reporters, who like to get into the show, though he added: “I don’t deny that they like to get on the show and
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
‘The President took part in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents and said she, adding without any evidence: ‘I have analysed the figures and
\"I'm going to have briefings and he's told Sanders, but I know it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the questions to the president of the United States, not me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and I could see that we've done this many times over the past few weeks, and discussions with the presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, in strange places, in front of the reporters gathered.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed to them, in a letter, EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on the issues related to Brexit
The State Secretary wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions that are less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent residency status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be made this fall.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I wish to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here and
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after she has suffered a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers Foundation, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury on Saturday in the match his team lost in front of Vanderbilt Commodores, with the 31-27 score, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place just before the break.
“It got to the line of yours and just collapsed and said Reed.
Abercrombie's oxygen mask was put by the physical and medical staff on your line before sitting on a targa and transporting it from the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/enlargement of the accident and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, student in the year 2, is in his first season in Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plazas in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plazas throughout the season.

The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be applied to a higher rate of stamping tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is to announce today.
Change will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising homes with more advantageous prices and targeting people with high incomes.
Larger stamp judicial tax will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not tax-payers in the United Kingdom, and additional money will thus be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
Overtax, which is added to the current tax on stamp, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an extra of up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, leading to rising prices and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
More prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become the ghost woman and because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked to reduce the tax on stamp to help young people buy their first house.
He accused the large construction firms of keeping prices high on the property as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Thesa May to waive the fees for affordable houses in order to solve the problems of homes and the United Kingdom.
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and non-motivated evacuations.
He also wants to offer them higher power councils in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will devote my prime mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for each new generation.
And that means solving the problems in the real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with headquarters abroad, can buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a much far too remote, and life in unworthy conditions is much too real
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland and
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his goal is to become, at one point, the manager of the national team of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of winning the North-East club, which is currently on 3rd in the First League, with a three-point and first-place difference.
He moved this summer to the Luminian Stadium team after he managed, in the past season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
\"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We arrived in the national team B, and about that much so Ross told the BBC Scots for Sportsound.
“But I spent a large part of my childhood chasing Scotland’s games at Hampden along with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club and
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland club, are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said that he was not thrilled to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club, after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question \"Can I help this team get back to Premier League\"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League and he said.
\"It's not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to Premier League and
Ross has an experience of only three years in management, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club get back after he got back in the C division and managed to save St. Mirren from retrogradation, helping the team win the championship title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
\"It was a decisive moment and he said that he was taking over the club Alloa.
“I really thought my role was better than my role as a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because I had a good time, I knew well and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I face similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it's the thing that fits me best in my entire adult life and

The ideal time to drink a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heat stream this summer has led to an increase in revenues in the UK pubs, but more pressure is placed on the chain of restaurants.
According to the figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA company that provides business consultancy services and who carried out the survey, said: “The constant time and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than the one predicted contributed to a printout in July, similar to that of the previous month, when the pubs registered up to 2.8% less customers, while the restaurants had a worse time.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June declined further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much greater profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people just went out and just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and the food decreased by 3% and
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sports and social events of magnitude remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% year will be added to current cost pressures.
Cannicular summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news and
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One out of five children has a secret account on a social network that their parents are hiding
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that parents and teachers hide

One of five children, some even up to 11 years old, creates an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 gym students revealed a rapid increase in the \"false\" Instagram accounts by referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased fears about sexual posts.
20% of students said that they have a primary and secure account that parents show, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, noticed the posting of a teenager who wanted to be raped and
According to research, carried out by the Digital Awareness company in the United Kingdom and the directors' associations (HMC and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they hold secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.
Eilidh Doyle will be the name of the athletes in the Athlete Commission in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was chosen for the role of director, without executive power, of the Athle Commission and of Scotland, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired internationally in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are sure that athletes and Scots will have significant benefits along with its inclusion in the commission and said Beattie.
Doyle also said: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and help the sport activities in Scotland and

An advertising in breast pumps comparing women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A company that produces breast pumps has caused the division of public opinion into the online environment with a commercial where mothers who breastfeed cows are compared.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be the first silent and portable breast pump in the world and the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement inspired by a music video to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes verses such as: “Yes, I thank myself, but I don’t tail and know if you haven’t noticed, they are not wear, but my breasts and
Refrenul continu: “Pumpez, pump, breast-feeding on the baby, pumping, pumping, extracting milk from the girls and
However, the complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was targeted at mixed reactions from those who viewed it, and among them stating that it brings out the news and the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen children only a few days from birth and wrote a person.
Elvie breast pump matches discreetly in a breast feeding bra (Elvie/mother)
Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate advertisement
Other people defended the complaint, a person claiming that it was a shawl commercial and
\"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant and wrote a person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny commercial that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in toilets) and who feel like they’re living and
It is not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry and
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with the discrete pumps introduced into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use breast pump say they feel like widows.
But Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wire or tube and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to hold their children in their arms and even to get out while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such daring and provocative launch.
Comparing breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at Fashion Week in London, on the podium appeared mother of two children while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred secretly to a refugee camp on the border with Texas
The number of children who have been held by migrants has increased, although the number of people who have passed the border each month has remained relatively relative, largely because the rhetoric and tough policies introduced by Trump administration have caused the weight of the child placement procedure to sponsors.
Usually, sponsors are themselves and immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will endanger their stay in the country if they require children to be taken over.
Risks increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must record their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking customs and immigration official (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Subsequently, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors’ family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we're going to keep looking for those individuals, and Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing procedure in the children's system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court at one month after detention, and not at 60 days as laid down in the above standard, according to the employees of shelters.
Many will plead on the case through a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal residency status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more they can become restless and/or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to the employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has no problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough emotional preparation or to say good-bye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria requires the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally on a Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that the situation will be managed properly and
\"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions and he said in the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been torn apart from their homes.
He further stated that Damascus will continue this sacred fight until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which are mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish forces and Arabs in Syria who oppose Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-stricken country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused some Western countries and of spreading irrational fears and the fact that it caused refugees to keep their distance.
It added: “We have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return and
“Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian and
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the conclusion of the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to banish the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement has helped to avoid a wide-ranging assault with the help of the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has clear boundaries and expressed the hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which should be eradicated and
Staffan de Mistura, the envoy of the United Nations, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the field for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the activities of the Committee should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution and issued a warning on interference.
Why will Trump win his second term
If we are to follow this logic, Trump will be realised in 2020, except where the procedure of restitution or scandals will end his term of office earlier, which a large part of the Liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would, without doubt, be the most dramatic end of a security mandate of all times and

Coupling external financial resources for the tightest intermediate elections associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh district brought in the race the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another current mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which is significantly overlapped with 17th.
Elections were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The 17th New Electoral District course has sparked a competition in campaign financing between major party funding agencies, the Congress Committee for Democracy Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, maximum-hearing election held in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democracy enjoys an easy advantage.
The United States considered the criminalization of the state of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then resigned
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with the Washington opposition.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of the Republic of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump organization's leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call American leaders from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan and said Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department in a statement earlier this month.
But they were considered sanctions only against the state of El Salvador, which received American aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in visa-related financial and restricted aid, would have been painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and crime rates.
Since internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in preventing migrants from addressing the United States.
But by mid-September, government officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively terminating any sanctions examination for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance that the administration gives to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports have been corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close friend of the administration and who has also spoken, subject to the preservation of anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of the special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump presidents, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his inquiry into the investigation of a plot between Trump's campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes, Trump will face the proper responsibility within the body, even if he is prepared to stand before the voters and may possibly have a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a fall in Trump's life is inevitable, which also applies to his European counterparts.
There are choices that we all need to make on both sides of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
History's course depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable Tuesday of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump dismisss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested the secret registration of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
‘How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote at the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.

The gamer Graham Dorrans from Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian game, after Spain's impressive equal against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify as the G-Group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow Graham Dorrans to play in this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team and said the 31-year-old player.
\"I started the game by thinking we're gonna get a good result and I won a point.
I may have been able to sign up at the end, but, by the way, I think equal was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first one, and we noticed better in the second one.
Thursday, it will be a very important evening for Europe again.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training goes also well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will finally leave the past season and that we will have good results and
Women have insomnia because of pension savings
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, so people talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in the study conducted by the company Nationwide said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t start this conversation and said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Chat with your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you do not make known the desires of time.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: and the financial advisor may be of real aid in respect of the payment of these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a long-term standard insurance police, a combined cash life insurance police, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being and to the extent that you have the money.
Make up your legal documents: come to the meeting of legal issues.
Get authority on medical decisions in order to designate a trusted person to monitor your health care and ensure that the professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider making a commitment to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that you are paid the invoices, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Palu on Friday in Indonesia, according to the authorities, and expected the number of deaths to rise.
Because of the interruption of communication networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from Donggala, an area north of the city of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, from Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of Sulawesi Island, which is at the end of a narrow golf course, on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrates 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a king lying on a coast of more than 300 km north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The region, an administrative region that is down a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
The fisheries and agriculture activities are the central point of the economy of the province of the center of Sulawesi Island, in particular of the Donggala Coast region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the provinces, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palou and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Management Agency in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regime, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with an intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian province Aceh, north of Sumatra Island, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to complain about the alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in custody of the police at Mat-Su unit, awaiting the trial, and is held on the basis of a security-free garage, worth $500, according to KTU.
He presented himself in court on Saturday, where he declared himself \"100% innocent and when his plea was sought, according to the network.
Palin is facing three charges of Class A offences, which means he could be jailed for a period of up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also accused of a class B crime, which was punished one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin's charges have been made.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.

The federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for the terrorist attack suspect in New York City
The New York federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack following which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a federal offence in 1953.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a hired home depot truck to make an attack on a bike track on the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cycles on his trajectory in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the opinion of the intent to apply for capital punishment in the South District of New York.
Both counts can receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required substantial ‘planning and premeditation’ and said to the prosecutors, describing how Saipov performed the act as a waste, cruel and depraved
“Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and loss to the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco and according to the opinion of the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The duck, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two wives executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit the spy act for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wife was executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching the ISIS group video clips on his phone, according to the reporter.
Also, according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded as innocent as regards the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the capital punishment, instead of accepting a life sentence plea of guilt, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved and said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament that is part of the Conservative Party submits that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to immobilize the civilian army and during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, Member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have come out and so far if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge May faces with regard to the extremely divided camps was accentuated by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the emergence of the European Union in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying very hard as his compromise plan, and the so-called Chequers plan, to proceed properly, facing attacks by those who support the departure of the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as by the European Union.
The Alliance has stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and the Shaos and
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit and Leave Means Leave and Solihull movement that he wanted to resume at the Chequers plan and
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the Brussels negotiations.
“If things were headed by him, we were no longer in the European Union and said it.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough district, added: “I will support Brexith, but we must abandon the Chequers plan and
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I have not fought in the world war to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country and
Bone denied the suggestions on public opinion change at the vote in 2016: “It is not true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the Union and
Andrea Jenkyns, member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also in demonstrations and told reporters: “I just want to say so: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
\"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with him and our activists who go out on the street and support us, first of all, in the elections.
Leave the Chequers plan and start listening and
In a message that targets Theresa May, she added: “The Prime Ministers who keep their function are those who respect their promises and
During the rally, Nigel Farage said that politicians should be put in a position to look at the pressure and if they are about to give up the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
\"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class and he said.
\"Try to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't let them do this.\"
In a message sent by enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want to help us and put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought our victory to Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union increased by Birmingham before a two-hour rally in downtown.
A small group of activities has raised banners that the Conservative Party is against Brexit and after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland and he added.
\"It's a farce.
Brexith doesn't bring benefits and he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for presidents
Senator Elizabeth Warren from the United States said he would seriously consider running for presidents after the November elections.
According to Boston Globe newspaper, the Massachusetts Democratic Senate spoke on Saturday about her future during a city meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a common critic of Donald Trump, is running to be royalist at the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was a member of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of the speculation that it could defeat Trump in 2020.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Finding the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box a later shift and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move after a few schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the inside free, after making a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started running in the back row of the cariage and was in the place seven near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he was on the front for a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overcome Kimi Raikkonen and take place four.
Finally, he stopped at the box at the 44th tour, but he couldn't get up in the last eight laps, Raikkonen staying at four.
\"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me cross the city.
And the team did an excellent job to get victory in front of Ferraris and to realize this double and said Hamilton.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday in a rally on his insistents that she did not facilitate the rush and letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for sexual assault at the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address, directly, Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed that the people were journalists, immoral and lying.
\"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying and he said.
\"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask her Dianne Feinstein if she made it easier to run the document?
Do you remember her answer? He said: umm..poftim?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that.
Well, hold on.
We did this?.No, we didn't do it and he added it, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent to the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was escorted in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide the charges that looked at Ford and I’m not the one that facilitated the running and reporting of her and Feinstein told the commission, according to the Hill newspaper.
\"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did.\"
But her denial did not seem to have upset the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual defamation by three women, the president suggested that democracy use accusations to achieve its own ends.
\"I am determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe evil, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they must destroy in order to gain power and control and declare the information, according to the Mediaite website.

An air traffic controller died after he secured the take-off of an airplane with hundreds of passengers during a earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero, dying after he secured the take-off of a hundred passenger aircraft.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There were several strong lines in the area and people are stuck under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his position on the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was rocking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which is on track at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to collapse.
She died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for the air navigation service provider in Indonesia stated that it is possible that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan at a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are pained by this news and he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe the number will increase, because many victims are still under ruins and we didn’t have access to many of them and told the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys with a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday to take place a common burial.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All minimarkets are stolen and
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia rushes to provide survival aid, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
You're ready, and he announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which soldiers more than 550 deaths.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane crashing into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declares that a person is missing, after having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew have been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find the man, along with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit water while trying to land on the airport on Chuuk Island.
Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not known yet what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane crossed the end of the track.
American Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very short distance from the ground.
\"It's a very good thing and Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the brig, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed that he suffered a minor head wound.
The United States Naval Forces said that sailors working nearby for the renovation of a landinger jumped in help, used a inflatable boat to transport people on the shore before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the accidents of some air companies registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. concluded its plea with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his cell phone records to head up the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being in contradiction with his earlier statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and confessed that he was not safe that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he knew he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville and
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
\"Forget her out of his life and said Hale.
According to the timetable, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.

Paddington's story editors have feared that readers will not be able to identify themselves with a bear that speaks, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following things about the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had a huge success and
This further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a bear and toy to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a sweetness and after it died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family and added that her father had a discrete pride on the success he later enjoyed.
“He was a fairly quiet man and he didn’t like to brag and said she.
“But, because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit and
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.

“It didn’t often call to tell me that it was very serious and that he didn’t think he would survive and said Ednan-Laperouse.
\"Then I got a call from Nad telling me that he'll die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, \"Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines given by doctors so that her heart would continue to pump blood was starting to decrease and come out of her body.
She died a long time ago and the organs were starting to stop working.
I was forced to stay there and wait, aware of everything that happened.
I couldn't scream or scream, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, being mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
\"No one knew and she said.
And I kept my head down and tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized I needed love and understanding.

Two doubted women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place different messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers to which people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day and she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says that his son was going to be a promising chef with a mulling smile.
\"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed his disposition
However, he quit work before he died, because he arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Davis said: “I keep thinking of you having a domino effect.
It has created the messages to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even to a friend.
Outside, you need to talk to someone and
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's several-year-old friend, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, at the same time as his mother's death.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he wanted and an investigation over a limited period of time and reduced width and we could have kept the unit and said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission was about to become disintegrated on the background of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their retention is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the 6 November elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they wish in the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has always made calls to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he has met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now present.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to make differences in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean MP.
Park Byeong-seug, reading from South Korea's unified ministry, said that last year some 1,127 people fled the country, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges charged by those transporting illegal people across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
A vast majority of the fugitives from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials state that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The least run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DDZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and, often, forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still, in practice, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a number of discussions that had as their subject the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between American Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the sanctions of the United States of its failure to make progress.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security and, in such a situation, we won’t be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally and Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as a scientist and declares that she is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as a \"sister\" and said that his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the Saturday comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared a Christian and told Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that Christine Blasey Ford was sexually harassed when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he nearly screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while talking about his family and about high school years.
He also explicitly condemned democracy in the committee, calling charges against him a brutal and coordinated and organised assassination of the angry liberals and that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had a biased character against democracy.
“I think it disqualified itself with those statements and with the way it attacked the Clintons and democracy and said it.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when he was asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it would be confirmed and if democracy would win most in the House Representatives.
“I just want to say so: if you don’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then it’s not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court in which you are now and said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgments against the Accessible Care Law or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be reversed.
“It’s not the right time for an hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say what a wonderful thing Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of rage accumulated and it can't speak without crying out.
\"We cry when we get angry and Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's something unusual, you don't know.
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who was in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous.
And then it goes on.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed to outsource anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an inexpressable rage, is that I was caught by the head of an older woman, a cold director and that I always felt a little afraid of, and took me to the stairs house.
\"She never has to see you crying and she told me.
And you don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy that you've caused that feeling.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado State, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-marital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, who was extremely frustrated, was thought to have no reason why she didn't even run the presidency.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought decision and she says laughing, 30 years later.
\"There were seven other candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as \"White as Snow and Seven Dwarves\"
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't run if she couldn't manage and raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave them $1,000, they only gave her $250.
“They think I get discounts, and she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotion and as a result of recognition for the people who supported it, frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to collect money and target voters in place of the delegation, but also anger caused by gender discrimination that he lost his voice because of his emotions .
“You would have said I have a nervous breakdown and remember Schroeder about the media reactions to it.
“You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleenex and
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my funeral rock.
\"Wept.\"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
Saves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although it seems to be a long way to conclude it, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing between 5 and 10% tax on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit by the United States and is also likely that the second largest economy in the world will take a step in the back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender in front of the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the United States on trade war could support China in a positive way in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than what has been anticipated so far and said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, the Minister for Foreign Affairs declares
Syria claims it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the devastated country of a war lasting more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
\"Today, the conditions on the spot are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism and has said so.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to bring things back to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that faced everyday life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maualem said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from island-sponsored countries would not be accepted.

It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me so he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy I could win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad I could be of help and Garcia said, excited, after European victory.
It gives the starboard to his ship, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at 2nd and 1nd holes at the individual game on Sunday.
\"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid and said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.

This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a hard fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go on.
I'm loved by these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us.
