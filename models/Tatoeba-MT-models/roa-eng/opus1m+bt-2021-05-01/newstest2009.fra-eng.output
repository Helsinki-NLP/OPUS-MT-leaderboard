At the end of the exchange, Prague's stock exchange goes down in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
The transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchange, the Prague stock exchange was renewed with its fall of the night, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decrease is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilisation plan of the American financial sector, is also noticeable in us.
Shares in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices succeeded, during the day, in eliminating some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hongkong stock exchange lost four percent during the exchange, but later, it erased some of the losses and reduced the decrease to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hongkong stock exchange loses 3.8 percent, with markets being closed in Shanghai.
The stock market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually the loss was reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange is down 3.6 percent.
\"The hesitation about rescue action in the USA will influence financial markets around the world,\" observes Joseph Yam, Head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates are in Hongkong at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators thus renew the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced on Monday a bloodbath and the main indexes of actions experienced the biggest drop in the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost almost seven percent, having experienced a fall of this size for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it fell free.
Congress yields: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the American financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 billion) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not so certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must conclude a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Dit Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, president of the House's Banking and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should have been put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in re-establishing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, it will follow a \"disillusionment\"
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures should have for market stabilization, - says Agency Bloomberg to the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US finance minister Henry Paulson, to give the government a final form.
It should buy, from financial corporations, unsoldable real estate assets that lead to financial enterprises in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
\"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this recovery plan, but I think we are there, Paulson says.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, do not evade Harry Reid, the legislators make it possible for Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They therefore wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress decision could affect Monday's trade.
For the time being, however, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still have several amendments.
The total amount for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount by following two steps: firstly $100 billion, and then, to finish, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto on this decision, Congress, he, has the opportunity to place it as a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the repurchase of bad real estate securities, including the value dropped, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
\"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday, - said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated - the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy -
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee President Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the rebate agreement, the timing of the time-axis plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new bills in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly monthly payments of the debtors and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: A Psychological Aid
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
This is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the buy-out of problem assets.
This point will be crucial for deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, says Marek, this week, at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important that it.
\"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, from this week on, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time, - Marek stressed.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reason to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl discs, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are in your shelves the vinyl disks embedded, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream of at least one such gramophone.
The same is true of music during movements, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - MP3 music.
There are also categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble bearing earphones purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
There are two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifespan of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just music reading, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and SMS, it is able to read music and films, to record the latter, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, use navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the less the range between two recharges will be reduced.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy gain.
It is rare for mobiles who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is clearly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more powerful.
In the case of cheap furniture, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call from time to time, look for, to be sure, a second recharge for the work - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, as a result of recharge, to operate continuously for at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card players know how to take it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except exception (iPod), any software.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most of the mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the interpreter's name, album title, style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the manner of Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Corwon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, you are mainly interested in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of order.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just have any mobile reading MP3.
Practically all the mobiles are now capable of it.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will get to you will just have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of the devices also come to read from WMA music.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods) is less common than it is.
High-end furniture also allows, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another provider) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases limited to fast-moving radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either by GSM, the internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their furniture on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handfree with connection.
If not, you can use the integrated enclosures, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive are normally less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you can have a very convenient walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of an exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and best tools, also provided with an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone gets to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no collision risk in the form of a random connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models normally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive come out even with memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a hive.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, choose instead specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the command approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went further in this area.
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't miss it for long.
We have mentioned, on many occasions, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
As a result of the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of less expensive Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czechia remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is far more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (Czech Telecommunications Office (Czech Telecommunications Office), who said several times that there was no longer any room for another operator in Chechnya, is crying with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much more chance (however, it would now find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable decrease in prices, which should subsequently also react to conventional operators.
However, even before the entry of the parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today at our home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go looking too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they do need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from relatively high construction, operating and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as expensive as its competitors in Britain.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, putting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
\"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator who pleases them and to whom they can trust,\" said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesperson, doubting: \"Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services -
In Czechia, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in Czechia are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area, - said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in Czechia were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not been hiding, for a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations, says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
The future is therefore perhaps promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
\"At the moment, we do not consider that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific markets.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us, - said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificness of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the declaration of O2: “We have not registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project for the time being, which could serve as a basis”
And it adds: \"It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement -
Vodafone instead directs his attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain his own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says in this regard: \"We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what we believe means the most contributions from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet -
The responsible authorities: in progress with the operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have resulted in a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profit.
So what good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators can hear themselves as larons in the fair. The girl accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTU, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This information is accessible to the public from the ČTU web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon stands ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: \"Competition in the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is evident that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high requirements -
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disappointing.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts its typical position in the face of this problem.
-The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the time being, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously shown sufficient interest for conventional operators, - it has specified in response to our question Kristián Chalupa from the department of external relations of the ÚOHS.
A statement thus made would not be surprising by the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers, and on the other hand also take care, so that no one takes advantage of their position on the market, such a declaration is more than misleading.
In particular, Kristián Chalupa adds: “Outside, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services”
However, to put pressure on the honest functioning of the market and to lower prices does not appear to be part of the interests of the UOOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which derives from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, is naturally posed.
In the same way, a price of essence strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
The Office did not, in this regard, note any signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in any way or any other.
None of the operators have a dominant position, and therefore none of them has an increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed for opening up the mobile market to virtual operators are likely to be missing even from the Telecommunications Regulator, as stated in Chaloupa's statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTU that telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different vision of things: in order to create a virtual operator possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he must play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators are doing visibly in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested people (including the previously mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Returning responsibility to the ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes hands of the case.
We have already met with this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to move forward in the development of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of the powers of the ČTU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests appear to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo-operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies publishing their own list of mobile phone services, but the mobile phone services are only public in part.
In most cases, it is a matter of companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected members.
The magic tower consists in the fact that the company is in front of the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she obtains special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
\"If what you were talking about happened, it could be a transgression of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could result in a halt of collaboration with the society in question,\" answered our question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that such an activity could not be heard even by mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
There is no operator, however, against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, while at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: “The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary mobile operators customers -
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTU.
In addition, there is another question in the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to unveil such an activity, and if it does not wish to be limited to explanations from operators, who claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were increasingly striving to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by them were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries were involved, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators deal with this issue in the way a hot potato is disposed of by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of our experiences, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable to them.
But let's not miss it after the cognac.
If the sliding information says true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market will perhaps return to motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can hardly remain unfavourable in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mŭj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek sees Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech Public Radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
\"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good dictionary, so that we understand the words, that they sing simultaneously,\" he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov mŭj played for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), Czech original piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Czech independent Republic.
How the new and the hymn sounds
Common Transport (MHD) Pragois will introduce, Wednesday, the chip into their ticketing system
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoese Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will be placed in the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time record it on their chip card at the information points and Dopravní podnik offices (the Transportation Agency), located at the Muzeum, Mŭstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka Metro stations.
From yesterday, there is also the opportunity to buy coupons online on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget the windows at the subway stations, where they had to so far trample impatience in long tails in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupons online and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
“In these contact points, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, who will help those interested with internet purchase and will also record the coupon they bought on their card,” says the spokesman for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to compose the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly Metro stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
\"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety,\" Opatrný added.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300-499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the central Bohemian municipalities to access the capital.
In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovana doprava (integrated transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using whom they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons; - explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of the transports in common pragois.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated with the driver's seat.
At boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the location indicated on the side of the cashier.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
“In case the passenger would need to check the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing simpler than to request this information from the driver,” Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the device screen, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Southeast called for a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Southeast asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Germans from the South were allegedly addressing the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is due among other things to a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American President not to allow only - šumavská župa - (region of forests in the south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
\"We have understood the situation and want to be absolutely sure that the words that the U.S. troops come to the territory of Germany not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators,\" are written in the letter, signed \"People, to whom the fate of Šumava is at heart.\"
Since the alliance with Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without respect, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
\"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of inhabitants,\" is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the \"Czech oppressors\"
If the president of the USA doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live under the United States patronity.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least had to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them were given such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Britain to obtain for the Southeast a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
\"They thought that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them,\" said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you father!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most costly road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport will launch on Wednesday.
The Minister's office Aleš Æebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from driving dangerous behaviour to the steering wheel.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, on radio, on cinema, on the internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol into the steering wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It mainly wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also demonstrated by the slogan - blooding - of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you father!
The phrase \"You don't think about\" is entered in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood flak, there's the phrase \"You'll pay\"
Which must symbolize that life can be paid for a moment of carelessness.
The spots will - the spectators - until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with dramatic images of victims of accidents.
He believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
\"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by gaining time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks must be reminded of drivers, said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
“When a static panel that warns of a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it,” Kořán said.
Olmert would make peace in exchange for almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the provisional Israeli Government, spoke in favour of the restitution of almost all the occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
\"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all the territories (occupied), or all of them, will be needed,\" Olmert said on a daily basis.
\"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made,\" he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
\"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,\" said Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historic places within the Old Town.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work, and it underlines it later.
Retreat of Golan heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retreat from the Golan heights, which he felt was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
\"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan,\" he said.
\"The Syrians know very well what they're going to have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Chiite Movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to Hamas's terrorism (Chiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as that of the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq, - specified the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Stewards in the car are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question arose whether the stewards and passengers could travel on the way inside the bus.
\"If the law is to be strictly and formally enforced, the work of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act,\" said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even slow down in a sudden manner, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical file equipped with standing or not seats.
If this standing space equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
\"This is a question we have dealt with with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we obtained that the passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat, - he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
\"There is no unique legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties, - adds with more ambiguity the Hanzelka spokesperson.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of road traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the issue.
\"Everything depends on the fact that the coach has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
Everything is in there, he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a maximum limited speed, interurbans with standing spaces and a higher authorized speed and in standing long-distance buses with the maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
The situation may be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
There, too, it's not safe when a turbulence occurs and the hostess of the air can form the head-
“However, in the event that the bus would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
The same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the security of the stewards by internal requirements, - he says, and he also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not settled.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their trade to be a risky job.
\"Never mind, as soon as I get the impression that it's a risky job, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce the costs, he said.
Security concerns are the reason why the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who, compared with SA, ensures a very small number of lines, does not hold forwards in his vehicles.
\"We don't have any hosts, and we've been opposing them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident, - he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using flashing and it blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he broke it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the break of the stewards have been sold.
\"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked\"
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the payment of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for the financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of stewards on the bus.
\"However, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it does not take too much interest in buses, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile to the steering wheel, says expert Hořín.
\"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers,\" concludes Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Dusseldorfois rest on Frankfurt.
The major words were not lacking in the letter addressed to home employees by the WestLB Steering Committee.
By means of a union of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the deka-Bank in Frankfurt, the central financial market institution of the financial group of Sparkasse could be established, according to the mail issued on Monday.
The WestLB would provide a \"competence block\" with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive blow to other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee is trying to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is always under severe pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority which has, only recently, made it clear to the North Westphalia Land Government that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, who knows the customers of Sparkasse from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Indeed, the Head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported that during the presentation of the figures of the late August semester he saw no meaning in the merger of the House of Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported and by the banks of the Länder and the groups of savings banks, has commissioned the steering committee to conduct discussions with the WestLB for common commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of the financial market.
The talks just started, however, are said to be in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers in Frankfurt's financial place, comes into play because it is about consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Land of Hesse government was speaking against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses did not join.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland of Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, took action against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Despite this, the feeling seems to be widespread that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could be realized first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers to increase, potential partners will gradually escape.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which has 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, instead drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
NordLB would remain strict.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, what commercial model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and transfers banks.
In the end, a parting of the WestLb could take place, parting which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any event, a `global solution' would be sought for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a ton of five litres of beer of the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds his dog can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta Nouveau station, four buses take this evening the departure at 23:45, `destination Monaco, party of the beer', arrived at 6:30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one of the busses travelling from Brazil exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sang gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long, folded mantle of false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three laps nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay at the party, and go back at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brazed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German speaking group official - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And they already drive in the night on the highway direction `Brenner'.
There's no beer yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates again take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
In the early morning, Marco's group finally arrived at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, take care of the little yellow helmet.
From there it is written to the left `Berry Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco`s travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it’
Second: `When the doors of the beer cape are opened, let's hurry, cry out Marco in the early morning.
`Course!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, but in front, if we block, and not all the yellow helmets on the same benches, then they must be distributed in the room!'
The chop, cry Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: 'This evening, to be back here at ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone new from the yellow caskets to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian 'weekend'.
There are no specific figures; there are 50 000 who are going through the Alps and crashing into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy express this weekend.
The municipal police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian voluntary rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which carries out statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the Hofbräu brewery tent.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance was insisting only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician was using the word `relatively' and that he would slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This is indeed happening this weekend.
The Bavarian Real Estate Real Estate (HRE) real estate (HRE), side of DAX, receives a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that aid appropriations are granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hipo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would have been entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, it's the Depfa-daughter company that supports the losses.
The state finance had, according to a newspaper article, refined in very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, down to zero, the profits from the allocation of fixed receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies in Konzern that the profit deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state-owned financial system had first mis speculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been branched to the Airel bank.
Because classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the child-society, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortisations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which remains fairly vague.
The fact is that dividends were amputated.
By 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hippo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the purchase of the Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposit.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was again considerably tari, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual share - about 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa appropriations of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a press release by Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is met with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets far out of business.
Other sources say that refinancing would be assured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee explained, on the other hand, that the Hippo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are assuming that the Hypo Real Group's capacity in the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have only to hope for it.
However, given the dynamics and impoverishability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inconceivable, moreover, that funding should not be used in its full scope.
But the opposite can't be removed either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least temporary will not succeed to reassure the spirits either.
The course of action has collapsed from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first leader have barely moved, the second-floor lending classes are slackening.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hippo and those of course who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank had previously appeared to be an alternative investment of speculation, and their value should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought the crisis into the institution by the repurchase of the Bank Depfa.
As long as emission institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that delays can be recovered over time.
Or it will happen what no one wants to hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching safety has now become a simple hope.
This should reserve sleep nights first of all to long-term creditors on the decision to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn on to constitute a postponement of losses for the next few years on the income tax of money gains automatically collected.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is due for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so-Kawaii!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trading Log, she speaks of Japan.
The first day of the course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way all by myself, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as ours in Basse-Saxe.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until nine hours minus twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the \"home room\"
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not very good at talking to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have the uniform of the school, I put on an old skirt of my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue raised socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I presented myself before the desk, and I tried to rule it out correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word \"Kawaii\"
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese adolescents and means - cute, cute -
Then I slipped quickly in my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, could laugh and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also done me that kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German homes.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted plums, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my sleeves.
I'm curious if I could observe it here too.
\"Why Japan in particular?\" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always replied:
\"Because it fascinates me, what--
In the end, reading mangas, that's what I've been doing for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at a moment, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak for traditions, usages and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen --
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes in the face of danger, which means he's also afraid?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of it: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine \"Edge\" contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of articles of the answers to the question \"What do you think you are true without being able to prove it?\"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter hard-to-practice fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the Prefrontal Lateral Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and management and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent from other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant characteristic could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness may be like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses us with great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
So what we disintegrate as \"maybe\" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, like the reactions of the body) takes on living memory.
As observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than on ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex's bodily sensation and the brain stem, just like Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in men and rats is probably also felt like this in both cases: how can one verify whether rats and men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach escapes in the face of danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical paths.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but the cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the origin of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how can we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress has been made to the nervous level insofar as the same can be seen in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly forming myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
\"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be an evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships,\" said Wasjunik.
\"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries -
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadline.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
\"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed - said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
- UEFA has always been watching us -
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules - said Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP.
\"We assured the President of UEFA in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer.\"
Several members of the First Division league have already been convicted in the previous season for handling mandatory relegation; ultimately, the beginning of the League must even be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counterattack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her ex-adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He's evacuating and counterattacking.
A late Rose War for the former Meg Ryan couple and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - to the eyes and ears of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the marriage failure: \"Dennis was a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful\"
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film - The Women - is told the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be \"Monstroux\" said this one in \"New York Daily News - 54 years old, that \"Meg re-treads the history of our relationship and manipulates it again\"
It would be more \"regreetable\" that the punishment and disturbances that involve a divorce for each child are revived in public again - for their 16-year-old son Jack -
While Ryan has lived alone since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the griffe: \"In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing its best --
Flight ticket prices and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, the flights and nights of hotels were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analyzed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after rising prices in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
The causes of all of this were for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a “desirable travel of U.S. tourists” -
Financial positions such as Frankfurt or London would be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
As regards flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As kerosene prices increased, economic-class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, high fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economic-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in the case class and in the first class, however, price changes were largely less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would, on the one hand, be slow economic growth, the firm explains.
The demand would give way to land in many segments of the airline travel market.
On the other hand, there would be a sharp pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of the non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies that were nothing but in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first in the ranking.
In the Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be late in the game and his shot up failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
\"We need this second goal - siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the halls of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over, and most of them took their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Given the orders it seems to have been similar: and it jumps with this second goal!
The practice was missing.
\"Everything wasn't very good to see today,\" confessed Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would also have felt more relaxed.
This 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit successful by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not do harm to the weak players of Hamburg.
\"That was a dirty victory,\" said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
\"We can take back,\" said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unforeseeable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals engaged - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal warden Petric as well as Jansen disembarked from the CF Bayern - is certainly slowly formed, but it does not yet shine.
\"We need more charm and more dribble,\" Jol demanded.
After the vote had failed
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in all history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
Around 8:30 a.m., the world's largest currency index costed 10,579 points with a decrease of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at this date American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be profit-bearing anymore.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares account for nearly ten percent decrease.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that can be exchanged in line with the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of action aspirated in the tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not address the concerns of investors.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US index of the Dow Jones collapses despite the saving of the state financial market.
Spectacular decreases in the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank courses led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of Bavarian real estate finance lost three-quarters of its value for the moment despite the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, the Commerzbank accused a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and contributed to 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stocks markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened up with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate vote should follow on 1 October.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to 23 million new shares.
Commercial and tourism multinationals have further indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
From dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe \"Ulysses\" has been flying in space.
Because of fuel pipelines that are soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing unhappiness among researchers - the failure of gravitation support.
Gravitational support is a space probe maneuver, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what researchers have been amazed about for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected to be in accordance with the venerable laws of gravitation.
Even more, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him in the anomaly of gravitation support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter because of the curve of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes it is hard to do that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the abnormality of gravitation support with what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would also represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken to Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their ravistors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese ravistors had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before release, six hostage takers would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the hive of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE accounts for the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arabic television channel and the Italian media have reported in concert.
Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We're checking their health status, said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions behave well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants from the trek into the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of hostages are still unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom - the officer said.
There was nothing left but to collect hostages - when suddenly, - this surprise - happened.
Some Sudanese soldiers had shot down on Sunday six of the raiders in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be provided by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily - El Masri El Jom - said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the ravistors wanted to free women's hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the ravistors found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law - which leads to suicide -
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight counts for indecent acts.
Truro's courtroom referred to regular liaison with his daughter-in-law, Stéphane Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: \"I feel responsible for her death.\"
The court was informed that 34-year-old Melle Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached and banished her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law left at Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, an assistant volunteer of National Trust, was being abused twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had told her that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 - emotionally dead - and - had lost all hope of life -
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter, who had written a confession letter that ended: \"I attacked him and bandies regularly\"
\"I didn't sexually abuse her.
- I feel responsible for his death -
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done that gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court.
He added: “I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
\"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today.\"
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office's departmental officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be sentenced by the Officer Secrets Act to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
They would have thought this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office, he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work linked to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The lost documents contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Company of the building in the face of B&B invoice.
British building companies could have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that reap the money of the savings, including 59 building companies.
The Director General of Building Companies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is \"irritating\" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The $14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be debited each year to the 700 financial companies that harvest deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that the institutions that have been cautious... must now pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will be in 2009, at £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Companies Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is - it is annoying - to see that the institutions that have behaved prudently when the real estate market is resumed, now have to pay for the institutions much less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first year.
\"We need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the companies and their members from paying this salt bill,\" said Mr Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, there will be a need to pay the interest of the entire year, which could double.
Since building companies are non-ventory organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny to litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that follows a two-penny increase in February, and follows a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide if they go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a motion for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested upon his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to give him his bail on his examination for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.00) when he was PM.
This is one of the many charges made to him.
Khaleda Zia, the usual rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed under bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the provisional military government of the country give her its full freedom first.
Correspondents emphasized that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she did not require a bail, since she had been authorized to go abroad for medical reasons,” said Rafiqueul Huq.
- We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order -
His lawyers argued that she needed that bond to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the military acting government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign last week in all six provinces.
But it states that it is not successful in contacting children from the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A statement from the United Nations stated that this occurred despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Court of Appeal of Competition has ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation in the past had impeded competition and had enabled it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's employer, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB twisted that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive - especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
It was all born in the record of the Inspector General's case of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Accuser, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
- Serious charges of potentially unfounded, unfounded conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved - Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began in December 2006 with nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to award these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be released for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him to be, first of all, responsible for these dismissals, and ended up abdicating his role as leader, and succeeding remarkably in not involving him in this case.
Other departmental officers, including the former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive a oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was \"honored\" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The award-winning evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things such as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put into trade in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, leading to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in English rankings for nine years, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heart beat became irregular, after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, Often forgotten, and May Be Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents are unable to give directions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there is one of the last and oldest streets of the past house.
But the city's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbouring landlord committees, representatives of the city agency and of Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee n°3.
- There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place - she said.
\"They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we would like to keep it public.\"
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee that the builder will give space to.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
\"Avalon Bay's main interest is to reloker this abandoned alley, and make it public,\" she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale to her.\"
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation of the Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, also stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the inheritance of Philip Minthorne's large farm of many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has remained since abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album - Rocket to Russia -
“This place was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrapes, halons, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes -
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarety - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be set in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled:The Book of Contestations: A Nostalgic View of a City in the Extinction Process - reports the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a small narrow, dark-day, dark-day as night, and delimited by the doors of a roulé iron warehouse and the Persians, full of newspapers from the past week that fly along the drops”
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat shorts at the bottom of the alley, near a door that was already leading to CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, an empty 22 ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby have said that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought that some underestimated the appeal of the street in its present state.
\"The best years of my life,\" he said, \"are in dark, wet and disgusting places.\"
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and former Director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book - not as Good as You don't Think of it. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school.
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that \"Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students\" is a fact that is true.
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports, in particular, so many other subjects — bilingual transitional education — for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language-class education other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students in this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the state exam of maths of 2008, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-Language-Arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, the senior of Sixth Street, this school has established the instruction of the English language - full immersion -
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me - we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him -
- It's working, it's watching, it's been going on for us -
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed of a majority of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr Obama's response.
Although it is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
“On the contrary, he said, “You have to make sure your child speaks Spanish”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the educational models that work, rather than demeaning or demeaning them.
Oil Net Falls as a result of the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices have fallen sharply Monday, as people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets will not succeed in restoring life to the economy.
The final operations of crude oil have dropped by 7 percent to $99.80. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange at this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by over $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having experienced an increase of $145.29 in the barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are restless again despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the greatest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of the Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustained.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, - Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have taken part in nationalizing the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have stated that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement - seem to have failed to revive the market -
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
- the prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange, has become uncertain - wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors -
We believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
- With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China -
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Determining Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had salt played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of a one after noon during which their relationship made a bow forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds in the half-time.
\"I didn't leave my area\" Favre said about all of his passes to Coles.
It's a poor player.
- We communicate extremely well, despite what people think -
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense fought the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and took 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have scored in a while.
“The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness,” said the second or third time.
When he was told the two- the Jets passed 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: - I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
Many points have been marked in a short time -
Gebresselassie rested, exceeded his world record.
Haile Gebresselassie, Ethiopian, again proved worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after beating his own world record on the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win at 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebresse beat his record at 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebressesia had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that it could be exaggerated in the eyes of today, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees starting, 55 on arrival- Gebresselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track riders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted to background riders, have contributed to the decrease in marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrelsia told the reporters, suffered from cramps at the spring two weeks earlier, and had missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
- Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best --
He was reproached mainly in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia- to have too much orchestrate his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebselassie's capabilities as a background rider.
On Sunday Gebresselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebressesie after the ranks disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final rally to separate himself from Kwambai, which ends second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone at the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic on her back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the Ethiopian and Kenyan group of runners taking a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrives second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, ends third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, there is a quiet little town where pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
- Eatonville, the first completely black town to be integrated, home of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today - The city with five lakes, three croquet shorts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison -
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival each year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city that she describes has become tourism thanks to its inclusion in Florida's tour guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, dignified, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who knows us so little, doesn't know what he's missing.
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has called for an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the look of the stranger.
\"We are very cautious about how to tell the story,\" Hortense Jones said, 59 years old, who has been a permanent resident and the oldest parish priest in the city.
It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of the power of blacks and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a southern black rural culture - a few times undeclared, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as \"Mules and Men\" (1935) and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, just on the way out of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious such a large caisse in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
“Overpassing the road on the left,” she writes, “you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well preserved playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn - sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can help passersby.
So, just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a picture that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well - Ella Dinkins said, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalized, citing colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty -
She added: \"some people didn't like it.\"
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were mocking her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he added, walking in his chair from the backyard that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that - she never stayed too long -
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemorations, no plaques for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or inheritance it offered to the world, said Valérie Boyd, author of \"Wrapped in Rainbows - a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to pass a highway to five streets in town, to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street to two roads across the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side,” said Mr. Franklin.
“A lady has even died.”
They threw a pie out of their car.
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education - insulting rather than glorifying my race -
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth's confidence.
\"The black children used to be kissed,\" I remember well, \"we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening,\" said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and chief director of the Eatonville Community Guard, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
\"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white--I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here,\" said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a happy, clean trust and lines of conduct such as: - how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company -
That goes beyond me.
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemingway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when the most famous daughter in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbours regard her as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the contents rejected the proposal of the motorway.
“The five-way fiasco, extremely fast, true civic pride,” said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summarized everything saying that \"Zora saved Eatonville\"
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (also known as Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, remodeled.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a back street in a summer rain day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today we have 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a brave teacher who has a weak for bright red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossian, mad and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good of the true civic affection that is heard in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after school to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
\"Most people, who are passing through this area, will think, \"Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,\" says Alondra Kenon after last Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city -
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and cover fund managers that monopolize New York, they have been spending the worst - day of work in the office - since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to falsify themselves on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latino still drags between residential buildings bearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging at a yoke on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from traveling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I planned to work late at noon, as I found out at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the cashier's windows, or to remove from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service's window, where the regular customers ordered their customers, the tourists asked for management for Macy's store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my authorized personal banker, all of them were tailing for the same reason as me.
Not the same, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from savings accounts called thrills (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 made use of the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, to the savings account worth $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, or the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
\"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that broke down, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. \"I put all my savings in the money market.
\"I've changed, I don't want to take risks.\"
Desecrated Muslim Tombs while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the cities against Islamization in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs showing red-lined mosques.
The police accuse extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the extreme-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday and this morning; this is a police action organized.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremist hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could in some way be linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic local community said that he was \"deeply shocked\" at the announcement of this desecration, which just occurred during the religious month of Ramadan which reached its end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its right-wing swing during the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two far-right parties that sparked almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alah food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of \"a European fraternity\" in order to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, declaring that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made a difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned travel abroad.
The courts banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he told the authorities that it had been under control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Police in Kent had granted this ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates the guilt of Glitter for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's limited court, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A statement from the court has stated - Thursday, September 25, in the Ashford courthouse, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
\"Paul Gadd was not present then\"
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered on the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned date of departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years imprisonment.
Kent police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or the potential displacements of Glitter in the container.
A statement from the Kent Police said: \"Kent's police will do everything they can to protect our children like those from abroad.
We believe it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risk in a much more effective way.
\"Protecting Kent's residents is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.\"
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for having abused two girls, respectively, of 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him for passport control, and in the end he left in Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and therefore he was forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on 22 August, and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's limited courthouse, West London, for registration on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as called Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
\"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character\" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and the stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in \"Flamenco - people - the theatricality of a few plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this least known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco under different angles.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month's programming, the exhibition \"reflects the international importance of flamenco, larger every day\" explains the creator, who clarifies that \"Flamenco - people\" may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed - in the street - are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture personality moments of these artists you don't have to make pictures on stage.
They have a distinct personality and character.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of the flamenco stars' personality.
With the festival-Popular Song of Mines- Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plated camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, commemorate the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: \"A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises each day\"
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captured the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic was the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-six photographic artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the \"Portraits of old sports\" (SportARTproject).
Although the concepts are different in -Flamenco - people - the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I believe that the portrait in photography is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know, or who just give you a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.
This collection of portraits of the actual flamenco that is called \"Flamenco - people\" is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at the number 20 of the Rue de la Mata (in parallel with the People's of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is \"true\"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as principal character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through Amazonia.
The Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupying it - is a real audacious - and that - everything shows that it should not be written -
\"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and hope to finish it,\" he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct some 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of -The city and the dogs - was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the prize of the Hay Festival by the majority of the votes of the participants, made the room at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great amount of humour, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to - his thirst to read - and - to experience new experiences - how he wrote of a - very methodical manor - thanks to an intense work of documentation, by correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his - lack of inspiration - how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
Hispano-American novelist recognized that \"there is no means to measure and know whether books change life.\"But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience,\" said Vargas Llosa, who said that it has effects, and \"making less similar people\" because writers were asked not to let themselves go to frivolity, and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The banner party that concluded the bullfights of the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bullfighters verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The evil of time has been found on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not have taken place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought into triumph, after having made movements of arms facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
Even the afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and an ear cut that the discovered gradins applauded more than his own fight with the bull.
Worse yet for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alva).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two undertake the leak.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to the information disclosed by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect him when the driver broke orders, suddenly accelerated, and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres below the coast, where the two occupants went down to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish ballots and then moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and to carry out the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been \"failed\" because it did not coincide with that written on the grey map of the van, it is also for this reason that they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to flee and determine the source of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was cautioned to carry out the various proceedings and will be judged in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for taking a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson of the California Police Patrol revealed to the magazine People.
The witness pointed out that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear-based on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she drove on her sunglasses-
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because she was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
“She looked disoriented,” she said. “That’s why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to run a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was co-operative and alcohol abuse was removed from the beginning, although, according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we felt that Locklear was under the influence of a drug -
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of having been driven under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat with nervous depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it was the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Councillor of the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting welfare treatments for his family members.
\"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities,\" Llamazares said with regard to the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations be \"transparency\" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: \"The United Left has always defended this kind of business to ensure that they have a maximum degree of transparency\"
He also stressed that the political party has - very strict ethical codes for all officials -
“Garci’s blood”
In inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in - Sangre de Mayo\", which is the most ambitious film film film film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried - to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis - which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, - Blood of May\" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci ensures that he has made this film with a child's dream, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he has always accepted when the story was held at national historical events.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is a “one-time opportunity” for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of a Spain that has been the chief stumbling point for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellion under Ferdinand VII’s rule, he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding like for the films - Captain Alastriste\" or - The Ghosts of Goya\" - more than twice as much as he got for - Blood of May\"-, because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost all his career.
The filmmaker of - Back to Start\" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he is accustomed to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, as it seems to him - humiliating - and considers that - the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed -
Many actors in \"Sangre de May\" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guilén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, - Blood of May\", - Seven tables of French billiards\" and finally the winner, - The blind sunflowers\", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, - which would deserve to be better known - he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you’re happy to make an extra movie,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a dancer also in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and of a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and favored for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the interwars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
\"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.\"
According to the dancer, we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
So, the dance of the butterfly, it made me think of a Cuban folk dance and - the snake dance - to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as his, she says.
The performance was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his performances, as he had done at - The Open Door - and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
-Mattilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy that she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, El Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the eternal companion of these kinds of artists who were considered divas.
This work also recounts, in a certain way, the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
\"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and does not highlight her work,\" says Bayón.
The show will start at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the \"Journal of a newly married poet\" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the \"Journal of a newly married Poet\" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the \"Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón\" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the \"Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón\" comes to an end with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition - Juan Ramón Jiménez: This peppie of light - which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the \"Journal of a newly married poet\" published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America no less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was part of this --
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in \"Absence of malice\" and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He was pained to get an Oscar.
He hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a tough shot for everyone.
\"Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend,\" cried Robert Redford, \"my life and my country were better thanks to its existence.\"
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the American esteem fell very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When the times are so hard and without reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings except admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that was pained to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, was to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
\"He put us on the high bar,\" noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities were not lacking for him to be.
\"But why should I eat a burger outside of my home, if I have a steak in my fridge,\" he used to enjoy.
In heaven, he attends with pride to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
\"Through all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, loving father, careful grandfather and philanthropist,\" he says.
Madrid in the race at the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a deleterious note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the pads, which compels you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dossard (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy that small-sized sweaters with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions began and we had not left our back bag at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it wouldn't come to mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Conference on Emerging Technologies of MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to accomplish some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to travel to the company's campus) in response to what was asked for in a conversation.
Through a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this \"receptionist\" can know how many people there are in the place, which they are - including remembering which positions they hold - and listening to and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But they are also grouped according to groups of conversations
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and tells her she'll answer in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about more than a change in strategy with Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has consistently added functions and extras to Windows.
The strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the necessary basis for the computer hardware and software to be understood.
He takes the same role as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the \"death\" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
You turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than running windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Which may be the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, more crowded months, less complex.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster displays their request to use their own search tool - -Your search. Our future -
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but at the end of 2009 or see 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore one on the Azur Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in the 'Diamant de sang ' d'Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we were to list all of his appearances, we could also quote this cosard moustachus, which raised weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple cotton male body shirt, grinding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel ' is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag ( hardly recognizable) that the best-known body sweaters have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand produces not only top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's bad to wear them only as underwear.
They're too charming.
\"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me\"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present for the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and myself created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opéra dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s we love and we inspire a lot of it for our collections.
I love to walk around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think I do, but in the end everything goes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very young, I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
The dancers like it very well to dress for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you're wearing clothes, that's when you're really putting yourself in the character's skin.
Suddenly, it's all tied up.
You had 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I had wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me, and besides, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to miss this.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you'll think.
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't come up on the bridge to make the mannequin.
Naomi Campbell simply called me, I've known her for a long time, to invite me to attend a charity parade in London for her association in support of women's support and the clothes we were exhibiting - I exhibited two clothes from our Mango collection - were sold for auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, I'm fascinated by Naomi's good side.
She asked me to step down for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the hairstyle, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of driving alcohol will have to install the 'alcolack' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkenness, or if it does not suffer.
The initiative has already been announced in June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness take over the car.
This would be avoided because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol rate in the halein and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is the driver's responsibility.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This is only due to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but, however, criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental purposes.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740 specified, scheduled official time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve to lie down but its rays still forced to put the hand in a visor so that the royal couple could get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked in the street, in the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, all right, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers this time... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking about two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of travel.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very exceedingly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before they pass into the room where the official court awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigorous journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no living designer more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Hier Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the window of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
It is certainly the second largest brand store in Europe that has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first boutique is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, have found us in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier de Paris.
As a nearby table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making a bad good heart fortune, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a coat of Mango and some ELAH garments, which cut off the breath, and arms on it, arms under with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without coats because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pair of pants and shirts - from her own collection - and who for dinner became memorphosed by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of ballet rehearsals and remembering the good old days, she seized one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez - another beautiful man who moved on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked before, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, this is life.
1001, the number antistress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on 30 September.
The morning awakening is almost as attractive to us as it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is even worse when we think of the fast pace that imposes on us the current life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each one.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' defiles such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or with 100% natural revenues that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run in your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talk when sleeping
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disturbance that's called somnoloquia.
This is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear in a very sporadic way (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There are no unique causes that determine its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (peak to bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overexcitation situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that somnoloquia becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation of this problem.
We said that it is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, except if it is related to another sleep disturbance that can be cured (e.g., if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, search for quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them relax internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreamloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, he is advised to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when you sleep, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thinking.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming of, then pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern...
Illhaeusern finally found the path to victory in his field after a long period of drought.
Without making a big game, the yellows and blacks have created the greatest number of occasions and have managed to transform one for winning the game.
The rhythm was not very well supported during this meeting where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who broke the lucarne on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn on top, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to spoil Dannemarie's defense.
On the opposite side, we would block in the middle of the field and just leave Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and soon after the opening of the score for the Illhous by Marais, well positioned to resume a repulsed bullet on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousian owner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his team-mates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to enjoy it and will not pose any big problems to an Unze illhousien who just dropped a little to -compacter - his defense, hoarse in the last few seconds of play where, after a big cockroach, the bullet passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of the fishermen in anger
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to take a trip through Brittany.
In view of the demonstration of force by fishermen who greatly disturbed the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him, in a constructive spirit, and hope that he will come with concrete proposals.
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the \"crisis committee\" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the flight of gas prices, which has reached a record of more than 1,14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president - will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation for sailors -
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out scargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing caps of nearly 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Ile does not stop.
A filter dam was carried out on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche facade, as well as to the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers have remained on the dock, or to the Havre, where about twenty ships have blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting to be held in the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the \"crisis committee\" must decide on Tuesday what follow-up to give to the movement and its participation in the interview provided for by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
\"The strike will continue,\" said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability threshold of a vessel is reached only with a gazelle less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable performer of \"Butch Cassidy and the Kid\" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes both hailed the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintained its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats posed to the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 delivery equipment, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first semester, the airplane delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats in the range.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which the U.S. monetary authorities have inflated, plans to divest over 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been made to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance abroad and its retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday in the evening to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from IGA.
Assets whose IGA plans to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. Air Leasing subsidiary, 59% of its share in Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, add the TF.
No final decision was taken on these transfers, continues the TF.
AIG must quickly make up liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted to it at the risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders by two percentages.
Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365,45 points.
In terms of items, the biggest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House's unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, which was meant to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
\"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,\" said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
‘This shows how far the market was in this area,’ she added, fearing that a project that was adopted in a few days' time - too late -
“If the project is actually moribund (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the American Central Bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, Mrs Piegza pointed out that every day that brings the fall of a financial institution to the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the repurchasing of the banking activities of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has skyrocketed, leading to emergency intervention for banks in the United Kingdom, Benélux, Iceland and Germany, signs that the markets are facing not only an American crisis but a global crisis, has added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return of the Treasury bond to 10 years was reduced to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% Friday night, and 30-year-old returns to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner of the first TV duel
On the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House succeeded another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took him.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that would have been followed by one third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's delivery, although honorable, was not \"bright enough\" to allow him to put down his five-week decrease in presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, a public opinion poll published on Saturday, gives a five-point advance to Obama (49% versus 44% in McCain), believes that it was the democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama has won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his co-rapporteur, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“That would be a mistake to underestimate.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The Seventy-year-old McCain had never ceased to highlight his undisputed foreign policy experience, while highlighting his opponent's \"naïvety\" on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
\"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that\" he accused several times.
\"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,\" he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he was representing the future.
Without dismounting, he proved himself concise and precise.
He has put forward his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
\"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, if, this weekend, has twisted a democratic spot against the republican not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the \"American on the street\"
\"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,\" Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina under a heavy rain.
He did not even utter the words \"middle class\" or \"worker\" - The financial downturn clearly favours Obama, which is considered by Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
\"The coming week could be a decisive turning point,\" said Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's \"good economic instincts\" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle - is the final verdict of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain -
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the overtness of Wall Street, the honourable senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wished to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates dismissed questions relating to the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, you noticed that there was an election, you --
Young people and opponents displayed Sunday night on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening after the closure of the polling stations in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: “the dictator resigns”
Some confess not even to vote: \"To what good, since they will do what they want from my voice,\" said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made it clear to foreign observers in order to take up language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Penalties, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be unique by observers.
They were not in accordance with the opposition.
\"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions, and our observers have not been able to participate in the removal,\" lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
\"This is a cosmetic change,\" says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is the voice, and in us it is the executive power.
If Members of the Opposition enter the parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws -
The opposition must therefore enter the political game, as dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent -
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognise the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the figures of participation appeared too high, and that the generalization of the advance vote (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
\"Did you notice that there was an election, you know?\" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, those who are best in power -
The silence of the night goes back to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood back to safe
Hema-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Descary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public's confidence that it had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the horror of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which sought to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer recur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood and working products on the ground over the years that followed, we had renewed public confidence - she said before proudly affirming that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Descary, however, maintains that trust is something extremely fragile.
Upon its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time in Europe, there were many cases of human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which has been strong since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations in the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when one does not know and a serious disease can result from this, then the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are established.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of those who had lived in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that has been applied made sense -
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: Nucleic Acid (TAN) tests that directly detect in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies to the virus, which were based on the tests used so far.
TANs have been able to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and not being able to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I think we can feel comfortable today receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover the health, says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant - continues Dr. Décary before stressing that, in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
The need is increasing because the population is old.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Every healthy person, 18 years of age and older, may nevertheless give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is prevented, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so frightened, it is rarely time to spend an hour giving his blood - it's sunny Francine Descary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of cordon blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered a biomedical waste is a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
\"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the setting up of our thousandth sample of cord blood and are expected to take more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing these for grafts at the beginning of next year - says Dr. Décary, who describes this blood-blood sampling program as very popular.
\"More mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it,\" said Hema-Québec. \"because hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in Half-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the fourth series of finals at the total goals, at the Stade Saputo.
The middle of the field Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, the terrain center David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round of the all-turn series, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder has filled a 3-1 deficit in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps have all of the same access to the half-final round 5-4 to the total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - victorious goal of Kovalev
The Trio Number One from Canada is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian winning dam shot at the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalev took a step in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
\"I'm not ready yet,\" warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.
“He tried too much to do in the first period,” Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation -
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party General Council was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to get elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
\"Resolving the limits of our last major northern border: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, he was projected a kind of Moulin with pictures.
They circled on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by \"Google Maps - maps, etc.
Great means, as in electoral time.
In the press, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The \"North Plan\" is the fourth sign of a \"vision\" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a \"new economic space\", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister explained why the North was - a jewel in the immense potential - but did not give time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: hydro-electricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains -nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond - according to the numbering of Mr. Charest.
This territory, twice as big as France, is in our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us - he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built much in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Québec engineering, the James Bay.
\"It's our future,\" he added, after taking a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press station.
It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government - he indicated.
On the other hand, - with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North - he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year round because of the source of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would pay close attention to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has taken an important place has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when a common vision will be given.
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be, \"concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly,\" he promised.
Jean Charest described this \"vision\" as being in continuity with that of Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded it.
\"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.\"
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday by a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Beauharnois Station in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, which made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press point, he invoked another, conservative reference, the \"Roads to the North\" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its launch was scheduled for 2012.
\"That remains between us, but I plan to be there,\" he entrusted to his militants, raising nourished applause in their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a poll this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was completed, including by a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including “constitutional aspirations”, which were passed as a letter to the position: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The Beijing Chief, Pauline Marois, pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, we would be more advanced today, commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the poll that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
QDA supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” said Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is on holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to tell Louise Arbour that she was a \"honest\" for Canada.
So throw the reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves our full admiration in saying as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as Stephen Harper himself.
We are here before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who gives himself to a court parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, inter alia, complains about the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We do not yet realize this, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our \"democracy\" - this word that Harper never stops branding and that sounds so loud in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morals: one can maim, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the willingness of a head of government to this minority (which will then be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellien Speech
In his 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the urge to launch a \"transparent public debate\"
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to theirs?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare for their defence and to fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a settlement to the amicable that will undermine the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the mine to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a public debate, while disregarding the opinions of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to paid fat lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does it first and foremost because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what several perceive as a bulldozer (following the \"public debate\" Barrick Gold has, moreover, just filed a notice to Black Canada's authors urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a bloc, the right to citation of credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, what will it be able to do?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment, which we belong to, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's prolonged pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to her claim, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms limiting this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$70 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months must still be endorsed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides for, inter alia, better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right to look at wages paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
\"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,\" said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
\"Everything has been done in a way to save the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,\" the democrat explained.
\"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of Americans will be immense,\" said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the past few hours out of fear of the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The time allowed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, however, without neglecting to express their discontent that they are forced to arrive at this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has given himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular to enable owners to maintain their homes and the salary of state-recovered business leaders.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary - he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another channel to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: \"I'd like to see the details, but I hope so.\"
“The great lines I have read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable - he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy, with the taxpayers' money, suspicious, risky and invincible claims from U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage credit at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CPA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the debt of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elites who had headed the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have emerged from this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some - toxic - assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision had also been added that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its placement.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain participations in the aided companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to repay when the torment is passed.
The federal government will have the option of delaying seizure procedures for housing related to real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and severance benefits paid to the managers of affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green fire.
In fact, voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democrat camp.
\"Of course, Washington does not hear you,\" said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Committee, to his constituents.
\"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to take advantage of taxpayers -
Animator of a small group in Congress called the caucus of skeptics, the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but reached the same conclusion.
\"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us: Congress was asked not to press and carefully examine the way to go,\" he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benélux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up acquiring its competitors in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (USD 2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the top twenty European banks and the top ten insurers.
\"This is not lost money,\" Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, a right to vote is regained in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are being announced uncertain -
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed about to nationalise another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (US 75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander reported yesterday that it would buy the British bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should be nationalizing since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her beauty in the eyes of dawn was long her asset card, some of them will say her weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissical mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His godliness, sensitivity, and skill that flowed from source will also have him removed from the register of power that brings forth the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who was missing Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like and which he had long been a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will come from these European roots.
Without ego too much, last brand of quality.
Because in it he designed a whole country of the self-made hand, from the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the driver who ranked second at the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic star are also disappearing with him, which will not be completely lost in the puzzle.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Return to memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises, is mentioned.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, resumed after his death, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's beautiful Hustler (1961), he will take over the character on his return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he earned in 1987 his only Oscar on nine appointments.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Still him.
The eras are buzzing through its path.
Young people know him mainly through the cultic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final sponsor role of the Irish Mafia in Road to Lossion of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In the face of many film legends that left the job early enough, Newman will long remain in the saddle, whilst denouncing Hollywood, its bears, its cheeks and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without smoke, as a challenge living at the enderplaying, judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginals: nevrosés, alcoholics, salauds or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed the unknown facets of his true psychic sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of piety and sadness.
Among the tributes raining yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) claimed, very attracted: \"His presence made my life and this country better\"
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, and a contestant of Hollywood's drifts also disappears.
We've seen a lot of its good troner on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, deeming the process of dry taste, although gag at first.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, has committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these sentences: \"Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could make Zuschlag &amp; Company in their billing plant?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
Politicians and their accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly significant damage, and other defendants have been held against them, such as false and false use.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to raise money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoices at the Józsefváros market, while they made the caches in Kiskunalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, made by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which model they made other invoices that they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Municipality of Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and by his partner András Äri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with writing the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
On a search circuit, one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will then be named Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert, was full of fault of form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned a hundred thirty customers.
In addition, large-scale invoice issuers have fallen into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name Jobb Jövőert nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the public prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, said at the hvg.hu site that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
\"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache\"
He added: \"Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, did not collect either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time -
The issuers of zealous invoices have also not reported on the travel agencies of Budapest, which are part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naïvely, they have indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Of course, as was the case during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services for travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revefülöp at the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the employees of the hotel only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the \"emitting\" also made mistakes by mentioning as a delivery the carriage of goods by road, that the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false seals, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports internship, both of which are not the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay any attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fial Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, this is why the liquidator of the company refused to issue this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established an invoice at the order of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefit was actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place, nor has it taken place, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has been avoided by the organizations to mention it in their accounts.
The following category of invoice companies is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the CEO of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was unreachable, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment for an amount of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment was allegedly purchased by the Kft Cash Investment company of Kiskunulas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Romanian man to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents in connection with the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during his investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies at Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány, and that he emptied their countervalue.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Masons have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies functioned, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since, at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, coaccused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he made invoices to their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generácó and Szövetség Association in Modern Magyarországért filed a grant application with the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant twice as much as 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out at the office of Árpád Kemecsei, Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a portion of the accused will relate the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the principal accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in their interest, or possibly the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of HUF 50 million, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, as the demands for his supervised residency, based on a relief from his detention conditions, fall continually into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, freely or at least, are waiting at their own home for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of overwhelming: why do we spend more money?
During auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
The neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distracted during this type of competition, such as a auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price.
These researches tried to draw up a neurologic scheme of this kind of \"game\" using sales at experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played in the loto, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction sale, which is an essential element of a third party's auction, the set under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self-stimulation of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overridden in the face of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and so they made their introduction.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received that $15 prior to the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the focus was on victory at one, while at the other, on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players - against the failure - were ready for higher installments than those made by the control group and the group - for victory -
‘These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation - found Andrew Schotter, the professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease in Hungary is mentioned among the first causes of death.
Patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary are estimated to be 100 miles away, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowishness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are spread primarily in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is recommended. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogenic gene snores the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world are counted.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is advisable to consult your treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick of the four corners of the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of painkiller, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph has published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford have achieved an interesting experience by analyzing the level of belief in God that can influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained manner, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a sort of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first one, dealt with its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding, while looking at either religious theme painting or the most general theme.
Catholics said that, in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt safe, as someone we take care of, and they calmed down, and peace invaded them.
In view of religious theme painting, they reported 12% of pain less than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
\"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,\" said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it does change our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, is there nothing left but the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it was shown to believers by a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same size?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth birthday, Google claims that we can find him at the bottom of the people's pocket as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centers of interest are.
Yet it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with respect to skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, these do not just see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their original goal that sounded as follows: \"We collect all the information in the world in a system.\"
According to Google's leader, after ten years of global camouflage work, they are always only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as \"What can I do tomorrow\" or \"What is the job that would help me best.\" However, software will not be able to answer that kind of question, simple at first sight, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all netizens that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for, on what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at my work? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not the remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction in netizens.
However, it is a fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing for identification.
Human rights netizens have been able to spark a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm on the bottom with the EFF e-legal protection agency, has proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgement rendered, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research that it has achieved in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But ultimately, it has not been able to obtain the lists of private users' research, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is mocked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they believe that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that they manifest against multinational proud societies of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its \"warming\" - bringing together the passionate, activist and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the \"bonded membership - as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as a world invader because of Windows, and this, although both fight for the same goal.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask its users of identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most famous keyword of recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we serve as channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing their musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While many examples can be found, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that has dismissed one of her employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that she has written on her blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle by hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do so (e.g., starting with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($14 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasingly high rate lead to serious migraines not only in Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions that have disturbing effects: for example, the top management of society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the maternity of business and after the company has judged the multiple daily restoration too costly, taken any time. All of this seems to be ridiculous in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, society detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are announced only when they can be used. What is sure is that in the next few months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the Google book and book archive project takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its health system, as in it, we can build a full medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a horrendous way only through Google's data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ózd
\"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide in Ózd. According to basic suspicions, they helped to eliminate the traces of the crime,\" said the spokesman for the Borsod department police station.
Young people have recognized the facts against them, and for now they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Television Agency) are girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder may lead to detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old boy, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and for this reason he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to an Ozd site where he killed him, as well as the little girl of that man, who was 9 years old.
According to MTI information, the young man premedied his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of it.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Fellowship makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Fellowship
The Warsaw stock exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the 100% redemption of the Prague stock exchange package.
Ludwig Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded Warsaw's scholarship from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months' time.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has so far been made for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Fellowship, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Fellowship, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Fellowship and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech krona by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent stakes, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, the leading newspapers of the European press have already referred to a \"second 11 September\"
\"The global financial disaster is due to the American President - he accuses Rome's daily newspaper, La Repubblica. \"The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the vanguard, to bring relief to a desperate situation\"
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 11 September.
Part of the press in Madrid also sees the voicemail in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress's vote, a real threat, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
You can't ignore the threat any longer - underlines the Tages-Anzeiger de Genève.
Some states can still extend a bailout to their Tituban financial agencies, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to make few cases of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only Monday did weak financial institutions receive more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hand to the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, partly crosses the old continent.
The \"salvetors\" must not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, on the other hand, if they were to notice what a rational way of reaching taxpayers' money would be, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart Car Imitating Bordon's Flight
What would be the best way to develop technologies that can avoid an obstacle if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CATEEC, which took place in Japan, the budding bees gave the strategic idea of departure to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they must design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a self-robotized, bio-inspired, BR23C-type, which he has equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
On flights, each bee is its own, oval-shaped space, which in fact looks very much like our safe protective hull - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department of research and development and technological public relations of the brand.
The bee face-to-face eye plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-to-face eye, engineers addressed the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoidance maneuver is carried out in an instinctive way.
\"If this was not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,\" says Toshiyuki Andoh, the Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and instantaneously, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the time being the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a glance.
To the opposite of bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations of bees to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotary movement, acceleration and slowing as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot were used.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is greater, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
Andoh says it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism must only deal with a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
We don't need a memory of giga-bytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into mass-made cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying banks' dubious credits, and using them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further debates extending until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, the leaders of the Congress have agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
\"We took a serious step forward,\" said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the saving of Wall Street, but of turning the rusts of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., the local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular climb in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
\"We are satisfied with the progress achieved this night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy,\" said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal, which she mentioned that $700 billion had to be spent in one single time for the repurchasing of debt securities.
In the past, up to half of the 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will be served by the Secretary in the Treasury to buy suspicious bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional Decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to set up a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful claims, mortgages and questionable mortgages, as well as other types of -toxic - receivables.
The department's competent persons stated that repurchases may take place as part of a auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools in order to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast repurchasing of the doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
\"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the law, as soon as it is signed,\" he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad standings and waiting for State aid can expect their departure allowances, simply called the over-Atlantic golden parachute, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers support to the company.
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys in a auction, they will collect an excess of gold parachute tax, unless the discreet bank president retires.
Directly after the repurchasing of doubtful claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leadership is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in place regarding the appointments of the Directors-General - commented the chairman of the Committee on Financial Benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State is granted a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will return to their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - the Central Statistical Office of Hungary reports.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to those of July 2008, while compared to those of a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those in the previous month, and 3.2 per cent compared to those in the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry have suffered only a slight increase of 0.1 percent over July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with firstly the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the product and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
The result was deflation in the oil processing sectors (0.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry have recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the areas of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, which is a major factor in national industrial exploitation, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a comparison of twelve months, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector have been the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverages and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have evolved between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 percent during the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7% in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, it was the start-up investment profit sectors that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in energy and material production was observed for subsequent transformation (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8 per cent, while for profit-initiating sectors, there was a 1.4 per cent decrease.
Export sales prices for the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they suffered a decrease of 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment system weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 percent compared to the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and by 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are good chances that the U.S.-H. visa exemption agreement will enter into force on January 12th. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, \"now, everything depends only on the time when the non-Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service\"
Every time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will not be an entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from now on in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, provided their support for the 700 billion dollar government's bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreement in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This funding plan, which aims to freeze the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even appear, each as fitr than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to obtain a little advance. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a co-rapporteur just after the Republican convention, was founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote the 700 billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-pound law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
\"Now it is necessary to act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy,\" he declared in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify McCain's economic ideas for surpluses.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said: \"We'll all have a hard time pushing it down (...) but doing nothing is not a way to do it.\"
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Board and the ceiling on senior executive severance benefits, and that he was personally very attached to these issues.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - it is as the Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled \"The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers\"
According to this recognized polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, they are the same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and so also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to happen, just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization - devouring its parents - established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they have been very confused about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is in line with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more thorough.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who have been rather far from the CSU, such as the independents, artisans, the owners of the bac and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled - Who? With whom? The party presidents sit on the reserve on the issues of the coalition - the Conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused internal policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now all around the coalition; during the debates on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be entered.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to speak with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-president, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Mosterer responded cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily an entirely open question, and these points must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the President of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
\"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,\" said Haider.
Jaróka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, the host of which is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, a Euro MP Fidesz Parti Popular European, drew attention to the segregations in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children the most, and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Partiola Populaire Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found during the hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their low qualification.
\"A overwhelming majority of Roma youth do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a small part of them have the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree\"
Járóka also stressed that education as the basic right of human beings plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the European Union's member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in as broad a circle as possible, also between the Roma and the non-romas.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child begins school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
\"From their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education,\" said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, a European Union's collaboration aimed at an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, and therefore compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
\"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,\" Joróka said.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities, which is guaranteed for all, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities held every year since the summit in Berlin last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, aimed at both the European and the Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the duo in Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is, how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair felt, in any case, that they did not hold their seats specifically.
As a result, they have worked to ease the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the Bavarian tsunami, demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the only sovereign of Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
However, conservatives still rely heavily on this region of the South, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganisation of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest reconnaissance group, which initiates discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that, using the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treats without household the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far drew the strings into the tails, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be fortunate again only if they are re-established in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU's loss of land will not negatively influence the Berlin's great coalition.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities he committed when voting.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been highly opposed for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as President for the fourth time during questionable elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would, this time, allow the presence of some MPs of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which was always more expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines across the country, passed to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of one third of the opposition candidates, referred to prior peace.
However, the Monday OSCE communiqué was already contesting the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when voting was dismissed.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a paper confederation, considers the two independent territories for a month already.
\"We took two steps forward, and a step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was initiated between Belarus and the EU,\" said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring even one opponent into the parliament.
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in the light of the results. Rather, it tries to reach its message on the need for economic reforms with voters.
\"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we must have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels for dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly,\" said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main outcome, the layer of the most officially supported retirees no longer considers it appropriate.
\"Because of the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'regarding the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time,\" Milinkevitch says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers qualified the democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: “People do not believe in words, but in acts.” In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: -From today, breakfast before work -
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But as of today, this new measure against the little malins is in effect, against whom he points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-faining was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
\"The turning doors- says Brunetta- are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services,\" said the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta further points out.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: “It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all”
In short, more breakfast during work hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, - a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution -
During a conference at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister reports that “in three months, the absence of illness of public employees has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand workers over a year”
And it adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
In the past 8-10 years, the Italian government has doubled in terms of the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
\"While the Minister of Public Service is setting up today the data on the reduction of absenteeism in the workplace because of illness,\" writes the association of consumers - the people of the \"active bankrupt\" - continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees met to declare war on illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of the home hours of the sick worker, during which the check visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: \"Crossive prevention\"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
Inail data confirm in 2007 that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of the institutions, social forces and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workers' Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at the workplace,” said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Merandelli.
The Head of State expresses his - sincere appreciation for the continuing efforts to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion -
-Of course, everyone has punched the punch to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, raise the voice of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents dramatic, even repetitive, cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the young people who enter the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to evaluate the warning on social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed the extent to which this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly.
The data from accidents on the job appears to indicate a slight positive trend, but it does not prevent the number of white deaths from being even impressive - the president of the Anmil Pietro Merandelli later pointed out.
We do not want this \"low down trend\" to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
- we believe that in general, not enough is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions -
\"We believe that Merandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school onwards\"
- He added - that there is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
\"But, above all, greater sense is needed of employers' responsibilities in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency\"
\"Merchandelli then denounced - the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for labour victims - and the - resulting from assistance to which the system has been moving in recent years -
\"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the person who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator -
Mp3 reader pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listen to full-volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
This scientific report shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, are listening to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability.\"
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones in full volume can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
\"This is a clear risk, and we must respond quickly, according to scientific data.\"
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this public domain information.
In addition, we need to review existing monitoring systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies -
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
The European Commission will now discuss with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of mobile music devices to 100Db, but the concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduced noise levels and duration of exposure.
The Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on maximum agreed noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions during extended periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano gave the order to let the Commission go for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Chapter for the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital, which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the \"official stamp\" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it wishes to stress Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for development in Rome to be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June-announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital. -
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno replied: - Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure of it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see from the front, and further, towards a deeper perspective, seriously working towards the development of Rome and its future -
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that this Commission is not an unnecessary body nor a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, \"needs a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit,.\"
A future which, according to the Mayor of Rome, will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further» not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean -
Obama? The first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous U.S. politician who wants to move on as an independent leader wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had reports (however, he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam -
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition”
Obama is really nailed: he thinks he'll win the highest role of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators -
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; of course they are racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? We also have polls, who all claim that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the entrails of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know very well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
Here's an aspect of American mentality that's kept secret to the end.
\"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves to put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
What has never been revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning map for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home to her ass kicked.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge spot to perform.
Usa, the economic gap is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this - killer - of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly report to the information subjects, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public hears, is expected to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have much to do with where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are spawning a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as - the killer - of newspaper paper.
The \"economic pressure\" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting themselves into technology, hoping that it would do something good for their journalism.
Today, the largest acrocre in American journalism resides among those who run newsrooms - that is, directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the \"security of work\"
Managers who plan to lose their job in the 3 year space are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The one of the \"safe work\" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and payment of insurance.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often \"malicious\" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During his trial last week, he was released as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the city of the province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the PM has not granted) would allow him to influence his society and to have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and even more interested, to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its quickest East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to - Washington - and the world of finance, especially powerful in the Central and South states.
The soul, precisely, which has made itself feel despotically with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just one example of the changes, of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is about or does leave to run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be not only here.
In the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been falling for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the revival, the extraordinary revival, of the double sovereign-state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world but, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balances of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs: that is to say, to respond to the difficulties and protests of the people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and among the various national strategies, is unable to decide on a common political line.
And so, it is the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a affection for credits: when you go through a difficult period, there is only the states that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose similarly.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a rather related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, ever more sophisticated technology, non-material technology, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with rather little material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are in absolute terms linked to a limited space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty, however, which provides for a fracture.
Those who say Territoire, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discretion, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus, the conviction of the various classes is further increased, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the traditional political classes and orders, which manifest themselves in the - revolts - improvised electorals or, in the changes of collective moods of recent times, from conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of U.S. congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have more and more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially escalates in an excessive manner.
In view of all this, speaking of a current \"mass rebellion\" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But it's said well, keeping your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Gain the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls as Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY- The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nano tubes.
The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti - Explain Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure the animal, a perfect adhesive.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the feet of these reptiles, and at the same time that it \"is easily detached from the wall,\" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Engineering Faculty.
MARCHER ON MOURS? - This material could be used as a temporary adhesive - adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? It may be that yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications might concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers presented a microfibre-like adhesive, which self-cleans dust during the movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer as vitamin-rich and desalination, if associated with certain vital drugs, affect their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juices, to reduce the uptake of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice has already been highly criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arithmetic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, anti-stamines and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS A RISK- It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to assess the hazard arising from this mix and to be careful about drinking, if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE - According to experts, even orange juice and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist - the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel of Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist in the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that resulted in many polemics, and was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
\"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of the scandals, such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention,\" Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a \"high-value economist\", but also a styled announcer, very aggressive, particularly critical of the excessive liberalisation of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the \"anti-Microsoft\" package.
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite aimed at always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various developments: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to some modules, such as that that that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphical development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create documents (PDF hybrids) that connect the typical Adobe-format chart to the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the drafting of texts, as each contributor is given a colour of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that had been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD may be shipped to the home or place of work.
And if the free theme can be a means of spreading it in the homes, it's just in business, that Open Office will then try the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Apart from the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations ;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Objective for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the expected number
Kohl is also positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italian Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on the Kohl test are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If counter-analysis confirms the positivity in the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the chief of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian stood on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus radiating the best climber's pole jersey.
IMMIGRES:New YORK TIMES REQUEST IF ITALIA IS RACIST?
Italy - as a country of emigrants - has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants - greeted with reluctance.
This would turn the Beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is about, who dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the \"northern paradox\": the Nordic regions are both those where we register - more integration and more work - but also a strong anti-immigrant sentiment and the most important support to the North Lega -
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as proof of the change in climate in Italy.
Tendance emphasized by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: \"Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism\"
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market knows no crisis
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
\"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding the entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high global costs that the families of origin must support,\" explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand on the part of the students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun even for the residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered, non-loans, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes approximately 450 euros; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Smaller values (550 euro for a simple one) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It can only be saved if one moves away in the peripheral areas: €300 for a bed, and €450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes EUR 300/400, for a simple, we spend EUR 400 to 600, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent asked for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities elude the historical halls.
The historical cinemas ferment in favor of the Multiplex.
\"A city without cinemas is a blind town, it's like a face without eyes\"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of the great multisalleys, and the death of consumption of monorooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that appears to us to be inescapable and undisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and memory-sufficient, - it is as if one of my friends was disappearing, someone we know, with whom we shared a end of the way and so many emotions - watch the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and who told about the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that have mainly paid the fees: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is headed with 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisale cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
\"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally,\" says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, \"it is useful to build new structures, but it should also guarantee the survival of those who already exist, because when a firm hall in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit for traders: the state's past debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million a year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first such in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas rooms of historic and peripheral centres.
Among the planned regulations, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the area with limited circulation, and will have special rates for parking and certain parking spaces.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” said Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in order to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make - New Paradise cinema - to which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the dark signs through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
\"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the Mayor's choices to the interests of the Pyromalli clan\"
the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of the Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The mantles also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type malfactors, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
\"An attack on legal and moral norms, and above all common sense,\" wrote the prosecutors, \"the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
\"The clan would also have been granted official entry to the mayors, which would facilitate the already considerable possibilities for the control and orientation of the public administration.\"
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, hides only “collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one” in his region: “there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the drangheta, heroes who are honest -
This morning's arrests followed last July, following which the police announced that they beheaded the Pyromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition, after the ballotage of May 2006.
He screamed at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accuser of having manipulated everything for a political question, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Pyromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged - the availability to match the demands of a business man, representing a more well-known group, close to the Pyromalli, standardizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from waves, the big ones start.
This is an overcrowded deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the big world energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossus like Chevron set eyes, and now they try to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price dropped, around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but now the ecological bodies and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity requirement could be covered by sea coal operating systems.
This amount would be twice that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Hang on to the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was the Energys, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a true revolutionary step.
At two years of this, more and more candidates from these companies have always dedicated to traditional energy put on marine energy.
\"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,\" said a company's spokesperson associated with the American oil colossus, on the Wall Street Journal economic daily, and evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us.
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit deliberated by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that right in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for further excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which go through the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
The experts are talking about technology at its beginnings, because marine energy does not dispel the fear of ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major ecosystem problem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technology must be used with a higher ecological impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a mud system connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through marine cables.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and a part of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking using six turbines under New York's East River Marines.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that fuels a generator.
Verdant has announced that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to push energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Energy Research, is now worth the potential of tides.
Although this is intermittent, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the shores, invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and foresees investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
