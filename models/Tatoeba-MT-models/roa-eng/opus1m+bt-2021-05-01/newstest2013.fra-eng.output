A republican strategy to combat Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is less rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike in Canada, U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws that made the registration or voting process more difficult from 2009 onwards.
This phenomenon took on a large scale after the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced in the only year 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photo and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove citizens with legal records from their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first State to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The republican authorities were trying to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have identity cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens aged over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18-29 do not have the required identity card with a photo.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States allow the members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic voting.
But he learns that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic party.
In addition, the Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 dropped the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted legislation in five other States to reduce the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the electors who voted in advance were African-American, while the electors represented only 13% of the state's electors.
He was also going with the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites that formed 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the electors voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the voting right more difficult in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on and see a clear goal of influencing results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PHC test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a great deal of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded that mortality was different between patients who had had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that there are between 30 and 40% more chances of getting metastasis if you are not decomposed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are clearly determined.
I recommend that we pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the purpose and counter-test of PHC.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone was eating well and moving enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
\"If no one was smoking anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,\" says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It greatly affects people's health.
\"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,\" laments the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embony and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophage, pancreas and uterus.
\"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,\" we add.
The power supply
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of a colorectal cancer.
Charcutries too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
\"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development,\" we explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family background with his doctor.
\"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer\"
The boson of Higgs Decorated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole eme, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or worse - explanation of the nature and behavior of the material - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is good for Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we hold a real new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics congress, in Kyoto, seems to confirm it, but still lacks data to be perfectly certain.
Let's just assume it's higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what this is about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally untouchable law that wants two things not to be found at the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
Even though the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same - quantum state - - this - state - consisting of much of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner, we find good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other, the bosons are agitated, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the masons, which we will not address here, and the \"particules of force\" by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must stress it here, not all of them are as exotic beasts as we could believe it.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the \"light particle - which is the \"message - of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this - it disturbs - the electromagnetic field in this specific place, somewhat like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this \"disturbation\" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, or from infrared, or from ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons - carriers of force -
More stable field
The same is true of Higgs' boson, as it is close to that it is another field, the field of Higgs, which must be - arranged - for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must be reached by very, very high energies, somewhat as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circle ring! - to reach such energies.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (like photon, ten) do not have one.
Now, what can I do - all these researches, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and this also allows physicists to check any gap between the observations and the predictions of MS.
They are, moreover, many of them to be ardently desired to be found, as the least difference could open a door on a \"physical new\" and close some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, has still enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such differences have been found at CERN until now.
Impacts
The impact of these researches on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tot-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Keep: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were polished), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a lab-gadget -
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not entirely his original intention, now serves as a \"eye\" for all digital cameras in the world, and has earned him the Nobel of Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that we really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this vital area.
The duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was snoring him had left him a two-year recap.
\"They gave me five years to live, I was seven years old,\" he said, half-guy half-rain, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
\"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it,\" he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
Set in front of an appetizing breakfast, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even gets to smile, talks to strangers who care about him, bring him his drugs, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
\"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, which is humiliating,\" he confided.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this.
\"During our lives, we learn that a man, he pisses on his feet,\" says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
It depends on the person's ability to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victorian-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides such care as healing.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die - conscious and suffocated -.
But the disease made me discover my children.
\"I have good kids,\" she adds.
\"I have no more wishes in life,\" she said, before accepting that she was put in a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the next few days, for one last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we offer, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we all know we're all dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Upon dying, we will agree to offer mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help relatives as well as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but they don't look the same.
Next to an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-cracked in his pillows, while cheating in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancers under the age of 45 - Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that fears several palliative physicians about the adoption of a law that includes euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by the summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify against such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to perform euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid some patients are asking for death only because they don't get adequate care.
And in parallel, a number of oncologist people find themselves on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helena Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she abandoned a trying chemotherapy.
When I announced to my colleague that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care for the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unexplained patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: - I want to die. -
But that doesn't necessarily mean - I want you to drive me around - that means - I want to be relieved.

Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the highway, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell daily what they know of a formidable system that mixes the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An industry, which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
\"It's curious how the system has gotten scared since the great means have been taken - irony Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former head of police in Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the abuses related to road contracts in Quebec, to which Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had consented only to a setback.
The \"Duchsneau Report\" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, it is worth noting that the only department of transport would have saved $1 billion on the contracts - some of them using their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission - it has already dropped two mayors - adds, hoping that it will manage to -show the strategists behind the individuals -
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also joined with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more police officers of the Marteau Escoade - who, since 2009, would have led the Montreal sewer cartel - to put the soft pedal on the inflatments of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has depleted repeat pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers in Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambio.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the \"system\" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for the years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the Mafia who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambide sowed in the 2000s with over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially Liberals at the time of power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fund-raiser for former Prime Minister Liberal Nathalie Normandeau.
Waste disposal contracts inflated costs
In Montreal, the \"corruption system\" worked roundly.
Gilles Surprent, former public works engineer, has done well in front of the commission: in ten years, he has received gift building companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and wine pots totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have confessed to fattening their feet by inflating bills from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected to draw the alarm bell.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies arrondissement, to the east of the island, she has risen since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says she pulls on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and push the stickers -
The process, she said, is \"too painful but positive\"
We're cleaning the wound, but we need a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a wake-up, so we don't see the questionable practices coming back.
Like we do the housekeeping.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that \"signatures have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,\" but is particularly concerned about the role of \"those who are aware of the stratagem - when they did not stumble in the mahogany!
Estimated 70% of the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironed: \"I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality\"
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100 but it will not change the women's hand, he said: \"As long as we don't strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.\"
He proposes a comprehensive revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of parties: -We cannot go further; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable the house to be built on stronger bases, with more controls and laws -
If this story obscures the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own courtyards...
“The PSG is not the FC Barcelona”
This season, you took a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players are here.
Every day, I make progress with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, I am moved by these elements to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the football.
But I'm not burning up.
From my beginnings to the InF Clairefontaine preforming centre in my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by levels.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to contest very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much about my position.
He was supported by deputies like Claude Makele, who played the same post as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hopped clubs.
He sided with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
Then I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performances.
What are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're stuck in ambush.
One of our major goals is the League of Champions: we have qualified for the 8th of finals with the way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Everything can happen now.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive at the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be carried out.
In Ligue 1, don't win the title, like last season, would that be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a major disappointment.
This year, we're really in the mood to ruin this championship title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media are expecting too much of the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us from what we have invested and from the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you earn 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built over time.
We have proven in the League that champions can be answered.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't, since two seasons, qualified for the 8th of finals, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were \"boosted\" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope in May we can have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking it away.
The PSG appears to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better than we say there's a -Zlatan dependency -
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he sets many goals.
He came for it and he proves he's the League 1 star.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This motivates others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart of participating in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from picking up game time.
I saw things there, and I got stronger.
Today, I'm able to make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selectr is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the zero (1-1) ripped off on 16 October in Spain a founding game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived a game like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure trading protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The course of bitcoin, after reaching a 30-dollar summit (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are recorded on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as - the most successful virtual currency - in competition with the dollar or the euro - and -similar to conventional currencies -
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as credit used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
Each time, however, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both depository of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file outing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter, single fingerprint.
Computers - present - the new transaction and add a number to it before -acher - the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted at each increase in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
\"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,\" says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Major actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant soldiers were launched.
\"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,\" says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizate, also the author of a textbook on this currency, believes a great deal of the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus become less expensive.
The bearer manages his identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can -photograph and recognize - specific Pierre Noizada, which ensures thousands of users.
There is a general challenge movement of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
\"It will take time for Bitcoin to come, but 2013 could be a turning point,\" he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered to be high, in the event of success of this currency.
We're from Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we punished them by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be able to do so when the West will become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armour convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overcrowded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferral on Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Modjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into a showhouse, seizing government lands to resell them on land to build refugees back from Iran and Pakistan, with huge U.S. contracts of subcontracting.
They did not consider themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have benefited from the American wide ranges will leave: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls and boys.
Work will need to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are friands of portable phones; television, and its Turkish sheets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that are going to order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, with strong presidential power, removing the position of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been rerouted, no dam is in state, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a war-torn country of thirty years, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to get caught.
Without energy to treat iron or copper or other means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also take a long time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school girls, boys, French department at university, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to ‘gain hearts and minds’, and to carry out the impossible task of coinciding aid and offensive actions, a civil-military action service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has led, and accomplished by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, local workers' gourmands, has been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable surfaces.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above altitude.
The embassy has received dozens of written applications for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency of foreign groups, what farmers have said I wish, a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its all.
Taking everyone in court, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this House an additional two months to finish its work.
It is soon two years since Egypt relied on an interim text, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his \"autocratic delirium\" - continuing to \"trap his word\" - and to \"piet the law\"
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end it as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time span that forces the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
As this use of a precipitous vote holds from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: \"You either vote for my text or I keep full powers - they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals lacked the appeal.
In November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing that they could not make their views stand.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, substitute members, were added to the haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Without surprise, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Some commentators had fun that one of the only differences of the day had expressed itself around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was misplaced.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that - the principles of sharia are the main source of law -
The Salafist parties, for whom the Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace the principles - by - the rules - which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy” responds to the Liberals, who see only one blow of communication.
Because they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include section 220, which confers an advisory role on Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with the laws with the Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying that people who are called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we can see the premixes of a theocracy -
Liberal fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olémas but academics, for some trained in the French system - tempère Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be ambiguity around section 220, as the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to \"fiqh\" in particular [Islamic case law, ndlr].
And the question may in future arise as to the extent that civil judges are competent to decide on this matter.
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that these are significantly reduced compared with what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more will civil trials be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter are also concerned about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
Blaspheme crime is maintained and insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no articles have been published for the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not found in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will march them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has five main reasons for returning you to Israel.
Go away to love the holy places
Make yourselves indisputable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptismal funds” will be affected by the grace of God.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he soothed the storm, or where fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
Believers are visiting the Rue de la Souffrance or the road to Croix (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This way begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then it leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Peter of the Onion and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree was grown to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words with prayers which are then exhausted.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telepheric takes them on this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, there is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists during the winter.
A shuttle can drive you there from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes total 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It is not possible to visit them all during one stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really value the diversion.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to see: Tel-Aviv Art Museum.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited there.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths made up of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts in Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of it offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because water temperature does not descend below 21°, while air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point in the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The water of azur colour contains the brine and very easily hold the bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are of surreal beauty.
We come here to perform a treatment based on salted water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also just to relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow lanes that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to \"your\" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young brides who come to take photo sessions from all Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk into the Roman theater, - to conquer - the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the people speak Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equal to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashew food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef-based dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, as well as hops, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, mulled chickpeas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, we find a lot of well-fed cats that spread out the air.
We can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars.
These felins love the places they go through and do not refuse to be treated.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest in the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited Terre Promise from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, prior to the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
\"Who language has, in Moscow goes: migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what will be given by the Compulsory Language Test Act, fraudsters selling \"false\" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will need to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Russian Language Institute Puchkine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the Moscow State University, the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the Deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have on many occasions asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they respond to the representatives of the migration service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from slavery at work.
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a \"voyage\" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will have to close between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They promise them one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they don’t touch the expected pay,” confirmed the Head of Migration Services Branch for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to earn money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without speaking of dressing them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
\"You feel low and slow down.\"
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will be aimed only at migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
\"Welcome or defense to come in\"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
Reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have records, so the extortion cases.
\"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,\" said Uumed Khuchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
- Do it quickly, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art -
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificate of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Fake paper comes from an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these paper tips.
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time examination to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shooting of the marriages or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradv, who killed seven.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of rubber guns in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the arms licence by passing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Everyone is not happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by “closing” the problem.
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demand to give up - insensible hardening -
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said to Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a criminal lawyer and specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed over a period of six months in 2012, with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot taken from a site taking command of weapons
The first is - the military trace - that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
\"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,\" says Baranets.
The second type of arms from the black market is those that are robbed by criminals by law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns leave for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these people have suffered from explosions.
\"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered to conceal the deficit,\" explains the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
\"We see private arms plants that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow weapons into the black market, especially in Moscow,\" says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and machine guns came from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
\"There is a local production, sometimes craftsmanship, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply,\" added the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found in the black market - because of the employees whose work is related to weapons - the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons originate from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are derived from \"illegal sheets\"
A salesman and consultant for a armory who asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has been buying the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he believes, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a teach unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We'll give it to her by passing the goods through a grid.
It transports it in town and resells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers, he tells.
\"It's true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, they do a check-up purchase with illegal arms dealers,\" added the seller.
- As in a luxury shop -
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya Station where someone would get me to a \"coin\" for a merchant.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman, I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salesmen in the markets, but there is also a need to come by saying, for example, \"From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth\"
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Victor Baranets tried as an illegal weapon buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album where there was everything we wanted.
\"I believed in a luxury shop,\" recalls the military.
There's no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not happy to buy, we're going with the forest vendor and we're setting up a target.
\"They let me shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating,\" the expert describes.

Search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons for different uses.
For this, we do not need any documents and anyone to meet.
- Just have a precise amount of money - we write in advertising on the site - Buying a gun or a battle gun -
Users leave their applications and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
\"Unlicensed, of course,\" asks the user \"Ivan\" (preserved spelling).
\"Buy TT. Moscow\" writes \"Fedorenkov\" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People ruin themselves on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic terminals.
\"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden,\" explains the association's secretary - Right to a weapon - Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, the experts believe, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association - Right to a weapon - you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came from long-term warehouses through the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the department, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall declined by 7% in Russia and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take scale or get breathy quickly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in modest wages perceived by the basic employees by Walmart and in the fast-food chains, the organizers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the \"Black Friday\" at the time of a flood of balances over millions of inhabitants fell over America and sometimes sparked slaves.
On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, who employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their job to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for the consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: layers with hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart run their races only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell his cheap products, especially because of low wages of his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
The participants in the events of the \"Black Friday\" demanded an increase in salary, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's basic employee who affects $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than he is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages to consumers' shoulders, each race in the store would return them to 46 cents more.
They will spend in one year only $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The ‘Black Friday’ continued in the shops from 8h in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its cash boxes carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the ‘Black Friday’
The spokesperson for Dan Fogleman in an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post that in all -less than five - Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a - operation of as many as others - by the organizing union.
‘Next customer’
The protests continued this week in New York and also related to Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase over time, but little, on average, its basic employees affect New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It's inconceivable for me to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while still living at their parents' homes.
Few people saw their main source of income there or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing employees of McDonald's who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6h30 near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue required cashiers and fast-food cooks to be paid at least $15 per hour, an increase of more than two times the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing the protestors of a union by jokes or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking on fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-paced catering chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the mid-day rally near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: \"McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they do not even give you sick leave and do not pay you the work you have done honestly.\"
Protesters have been supported by other New Yorkers in view, especially by the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that - we all have to support the workers of the fast restoration to obtain a fair salary and economic well-being that each New Yorkers deserve.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not counting that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
For the moment it is difficult to tell whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
\"For the moment, we can only mediumly deceive the brain.\"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google who unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is evident from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked-handed air, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment with pixels on flat screen and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect made physical interaction, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for the moment, does not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not large gestures, but discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that so?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work to develop new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
They can be laser sensors, they produce quite good resolution in depth, and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is about the present generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which adds work to the designers of algorithms.
The resolution should be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch of sensors a regular treatment delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my job, but not to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is in fact a normal sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or squeeze it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of technologies of the increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased, transitory reality, which would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to your smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (personal elements are the ones you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel a thing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perceived in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these images in the air: for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of an air breath on the fingers.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will still take a long time to get bad: the way to make someone believe that is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of race rugs (rather with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only mediumly deceive the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The rule of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
\"Rosbalt - continues the project - The vanguard peterbourgeoise - dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the vanguard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and which have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of \"Rosbalt\" is the extraverti painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather barbu man, all of red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the feasts and varnishes connected.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the most social and philosophical Dutch counterers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Dutch foreman in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbaria and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a sewing machine specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palais de la culture Nevskiy where my work was.
I understood it was my way.
So the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to \"Puchinskaya-10\" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds of things except words.
- It was important for me to find myself at the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took a seat in Puchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the Dutch bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: the NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project - Van Gogh's ear -
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in mullots, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a composer today in fashion.
When the group started to grow live, it became \"Leningrad\"
Trakhtenberg was not bad at emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it is when his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is in us that he received them.
Gallery -D137 - Club -Griboiedov -: these are the effects of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, from the time culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price -The personalities of our city -
I was named \"Peint of the Year\" and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognisable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and a sharpness.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition - The Russian Museum through clowns -
The clowns belong to an untimely category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with the clowns, it all fades, the tragic falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we'll have to spit on him.
And the lie will be wiped out by disguise.
- Recently we saw you as the organ player of Barbaria. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful, too?
- Today the commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, the people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the nests another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-community, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think of who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end it is less management, money, all waste.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption doesn't have a culture, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of line, because we need higher experts who will properly assess these experts and they will find a way out.
At present, it is the \"kingdom of taste\" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for that.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashion as it was in the early last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Fellowship
Fall into space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landmen on board are looking for a rescue planet.
To save mankind, a big question arises: how do we continue to live our species as a waiter or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much of a choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, it would only be by chance.
\"This is Venus and Mars,\" says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to take an interest in reproductive issues in space by focusing on flora.
There's still a half-century, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then insects, small reproductive drosophile flies, were placed on orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into outer space to see how an embryo was developed in a binder.
We get a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
Then the problems begin.
The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find a support, it needs to get on its feet and start moving, explains the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biologic Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When there was no support, the chicks were messy.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die at the end of four days.
\"We've slipped their eyes twice, and then abandoned them, because it's simply impossible to work with them there,\" says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with chicks in space.
The last - the miniature - biological ark with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite - Bion - will only embark on species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
“It was still biosatellite and then it’s the only experience. We need to do this kind of research,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their progeny.
However, reproductions are not yet performed directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has the most precious.
Our mussel flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would take place after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
\"No one answered that question,\" says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into outer space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being on orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy seed after long flights.
\"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during the orbits,\" concludes the driver and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of Hydrology of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the apexant.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to adjust to the water.
It's logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it only happens 2 weeks.
- It's very little to forget - explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the assailant is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
The muscles of the belly, the basin, are atrophing very quickly, and the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's just ignore that by pressing the delivery simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get it out.
“And then,” Valeriy Poliakov asked for an invitation to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not experience Earth's attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
“And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to a return to Earth of a disabled, completely maladapted child,” said Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in outer space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Terriens will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institute for Public Finance Control) said: “Control of the self-employment pseudo (Czech) failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is on the brink of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala said, the Vice-President of the Higher Institute for the Control of Public Finance in an interview for Aktualně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my view, it is what is lacking in us,” Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the Švarc system by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority to go and inspect law enforcement, says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of both countries were compared.
What was it about specifically?
It is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as the practice itself.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps - more severe and of better quality - nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what results for you?
A common control of this type should contribute precisely to what we would stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a truly positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve that goal.
It may be that this system is at such a point submerged by paperwork, that those who seek fault will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organization?
In the case of institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organized in a similar way, it also has a council set up somewhat differently, but these two institutions basically proceed similarly .
Competences are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds with us to the state's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities in our home are controlled there at the level of the Länder accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a wide range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, wouldn't they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has it meant to you, as an institution, the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, its effects are already felt?
Having entered into force relatively recently, this amendment has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do later controls, we have to rely on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of \"detection of risks of mismanagement - with which we have passed to the rostrum of nearly 14 000 public procurement - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you, therefore, consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem may arise is that these rules become more severe and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was obliged by controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the Markets Act means failure to discipline the budget.
Is it really helpful, then, to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to that?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He may say: \"We will change the law and authorize it,\" but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are by freezing places, but most remain practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were feasible this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillated between -5 ° and -10 °C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and there is only one thin layer of snow remaining in the plains.
The mountain ridges (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that because of the fog, visibility was reduced by locations.
The R6 rapid route and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still some of their sections of frozen snow and traffic-torn places.
Especially in high-level areas, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of verglas and that snow layers covered by traffic can be found on the roads in mountainous and high-lying areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of ice-cream formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class routes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow covered by traffic is present on the roads in the high-lying areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry, most often cleared, with possible cloud passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The routes in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, by locations, there is a need for greater vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the latest snowfall and subsequent cooling, some channels of communication may be by frozen locations.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practically feasible without difficulty, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class pathways are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, particularly on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the Olomouc area at altitude today must have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the col saying \"Červenohorské sedlo\" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the drivers are feasible without difficulty.
On the heights of the Šumperk district are snowy remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the col said-Červenohorské sedlo - a thick and soft snow layer - today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues from the district of Jeseník also visited the area during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are feasible without difficulty, however drivers in the district of Šternberk should be careful in the sections in forest areas with wet roads.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem et de Liberec
By this morning, road maintenance services in Northern Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
It appears from the police data, that in addition to some snow-covered or blue-collar locations, the mountain road from Telnice to Knicice na Usttecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below more and lower altitude, and therefore snow and frost should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohème, there is, on the contrary, no problem and roads are usually dry.
No traffic problems have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, sky and ice during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the circulation between Telnice and Knicice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: \"In concert, we want to collect positive energy.\"
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our The Tap Tap group, we are rather hard at it and we are said to be the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to think about the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an hymn against the end of the world that is called “End of the cancelled world” (Czech-Keec světa zrušeno-).
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it also at these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
The anthems will also meet at a certain point in the context of a very unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, because we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to make them actively involved in these projects.
It has proved that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts for the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on with the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedličkŭv Institute and offer activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several groups of music and interpreters go on stage at each of these concerts?
Which criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go to Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustrator with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other — mega events — of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there, too, we will probably prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it's first thing.
We have five members in electric chair whose machines must travel in support, of course we also trim many bags and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has been more or less well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you had so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our home, we have just been witnesses in Moscow that in the east it is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very limited to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for one person to move in an electric chair alone in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it clear to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the point of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists among us.
For the time being, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá¢a Angelovič says, we have lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Did success happen only in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understand that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the EU's subsidies, we can also allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Do you plan to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it's logical: everything that's new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to our home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Laja Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
That will be the day before the expected day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of The Tap Tap - End of the cancelled world - will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo Multifunctional Training Centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the presale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of Agency projects.
The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always find understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled Introduction to Astronautics.
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his book - Introduction to Astronautics.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a world-renowned astronomical propagator, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
By 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the drain.
The only information known about this drachma is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book \"Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietbomba lotnicza\" was published by a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were conducted by the interim scientific advisory committee \"Tymczasowy Committeeet Doradczo-Naukowy\", which coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronomical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Atronautyczne).
For the first time, it is about a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronomical Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronomical federation.
He retained his function until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the Meteorological rocket MRI (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have ranged up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were subsequently built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later, should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the programme.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility work.
This decision raised a lively debate in public opinion.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetuity in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free (without limits) free movement of private capital linked to a terrible financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wages) result in price tension.
The following meaning should be put to the end: a producer strives to import goods sold at low prices to withstand economic competition by making the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and thus responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect will of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage to society as a whole through this profit race.
This situation is at such a public level that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital from them.
In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is evident primarily in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due on the one hand to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of employees in the area of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FDR, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for employees to receive such salaries that the State is forced to pay a supplement in order to achieve the vital minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliary workers in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the EU Member States in the South undoubtedly lead to a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The following question needs to be asked: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to give up, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then must be asked whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not lead, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to that question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In the FDR, the situation is such that because of the lack of financial resources, national departments link the development of bills to law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that the liberalist-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book \"the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey\": \"The state was long in the midst of delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
The beatings of pots, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold -... ... - Honest people did not seek any function, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without counsel - ... ' It was really to be said that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it had to choose an energetic man - ... It is true that Appianos had in the spirit Pompey, but it is Caesar who has irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
This results, today as in the past, in a decade without preceding the elites, without any effort to make profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be regarded as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the present elites are completely unaware of the fate of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and at European level, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, in fact, systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
\"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able\" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of the refrane is - let's not forget how fragile we are -
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there would be no wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take part in Israel, claiming its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view - behind the curtain - on the one to which they mainly enjoy the tensions that have already endured for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others come from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family is particularly distinguished, which could be considered the head of the lice (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s to the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to linking their names with serious criminal acts that they were involved in and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or conduct wars against the countries in which they do not yet have such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to fight this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Rothschild Bank of America the central bank status and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the EDF for triggering the huge economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the 1859s to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a franc-mason initiated at 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The purpose of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and eventually acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent crises from being repeated like those they caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by triggering the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the morcellation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they imposed on Germany the conditions of radicalization of the poor masses (they then had to place a strong enough leader, showing the finger of the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakian composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which actually had) of fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the historical Judaea region with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above lays the basis for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler has broken the channels in which international bankers had originally held it; or if all he has done was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were the origin of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel set up a firehouse that could lead to a third world war.
If international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide strongly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victimized in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where wrong is caused by an endless circle of violence and where one finds, at the origin of all things, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
It is necessary here to make a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our home, international bankers offer people elections only their own candidates.
Israel's current prime minister is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of that country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) extend to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all world oil transits (this naval corridor has only a width of 2 miles) and results in a destruction of the world economy.
In what light now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 appear: \"The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order\"
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is born is implanted at birth by an electronic chip making it a fully controlled being.
“Let all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to carry on the hand or front a mark on the red iron, so that he cannot buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the person who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and is six hundred sixty six -
The film Argo: When everything goes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protestors made up of Islamist students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the liberation of hostages.
It was a tough blow to the prestige of the United States, which was further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States provokes a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranism.
The Iranian debacle greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated periods, they found themselves in the Ambassador of Canada's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team who came to make screenings for shooting a film with a great science-fiction performance.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized shops reported on this film project, press conferences were held and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way, but also a \"moving cap\" - the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - like, for example, in the ocean's trilogy raise, tweet and thirteen.
Ambiences happen: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the captioned sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retranslated in the film, there are no major differences),
the lightest passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with custom men discussing the situation around conference tables, corridors and telephones...
Ben Affleck was able to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark police - Gone Baby Gone - (2007) and the thriller - Thetown - (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is held by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a history page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions to too many places
The director had to be content with a subject that offered in fact only a few striking scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He's doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is removed by a phone shot in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite fired by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events at too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-ops, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it shows itself with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
It drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the matter.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the settlement competition or ideas from the EU workshop - the most absurd.
\"The fact that the EU has been considering adopting a 40 per cent quota for the management of large European companies in recent times has been the source of our decision,\" said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of this survey, Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women were favoured in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report to the end of the year any other idea as incredible as the \"EU workshop\"
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the prohibition on using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the expression - butter to tarnish - or the withdrawal of the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (as well as the Czech Republic currently imposes demands on its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union should not be of a size of less than 14 cm, nor should they have an abnormal ‘curve’.
The European Commission argued that it only harmonized non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruits and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives are a waste of food.
The first price will be awarded in this investigation to EU regulation last year that must be included on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 should not swell without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are among toys the first cause of child deaths by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with regard to blowing in fair trumpets.
So do we. We have some weird ideas.
The following rule on European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name ‘Macedonia’ and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association-Laissez Fare-, a group of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and thus risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
\"The fact that we don't have a sea is handicaping us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund - In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called \"interventionist\" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it was then due to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and launched an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were specifically intended to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: \"The strange regulations are rare\"
While the regulations often create criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its general development, deserve praise.
For example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight that it does not always come off victorious) creates strong emotions in Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name - Olomoucké tvarŭžky - for the name - Tuzemský rum - which dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name - Tuzemák -
Only products based on cane sugar, not beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official EU list of registered EU products, there are today alongside worldwide cheeses known as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's massepain or Parme's ham, Karlovy Vary-Karlovarské suchary biscuits, Pohořelice and Třeboň-Pohořelický a Třeboňský katr- and Žatecký chmel's houblon.
Pardubice's spice bread - Pardubický perník - and cakes called \"Hořice's Cornets - -hořické trubičky - can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura declares
Mr. Senator, how is it that we have the idea of attending the presidential elections?
It is not a matter of being a senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been pillaged for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement increases.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly set in for the Château (N.d.T.: chair of the presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start in the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Later, I stated that if I were elected as a senator, I would report to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are laughing at the bar or in front of our television station, but we are also trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition to this is the press that violates the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I am deafening journalists or that I was the adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You started the struggle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You need to change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives on the left or on the right with a good project, it is clearly denied and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think you're a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people put me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to gather people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of the parliament, there are only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them in my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
Then perhaps they should explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the president's election to direct suffrage, which was achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without ambition, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, that's why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to attend the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the warehouse.
I was introduced because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and what they did most of them gave their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct suffrage of mayors and mayors of regions.
Are you planning on founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money either for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my account - transparent -
You don't have any money?
You're talking tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to about 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
Either I said passing by, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you're worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I quit?
I've already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I won't report to any election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say that you'd put your activities in a sardine?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
It's a good thing, though, that I live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I kept winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV office prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountains of newly erected books - 2 photos
\"I think this building is funny, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,\" says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: “Yes, it’s actually beautiful, this building”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes out of his way in one of these distant libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing to attract to the doors of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The town of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore a few neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges on euro banknotes in the form of pretty little painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the architects' office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the diagrams in bold sticks and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and presented to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a twist on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, bewildered and hoisting their shoulders, Maas, the effronté, stacks his books of choice in order of size to make them a pyramid, and ends his discourse supported by activist arguments by one: - desire common -
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain lay in ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few local buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the book mount received the second prize -Best Library of NL 2012 -
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the way this little tender bourgade, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a mayor of an agonizing laisseur whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under cheese bell.
True, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you multiply the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the ground in Dutch bricks and the elegant reverbers speak the language of the municipal public places unequivocally.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
\"Normally, the library rays are along the facade and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,\" says Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical spatial configuration and open the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mount has been carefully designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the building's technical center.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes of the lamps, sometimes of the balustrades, sometimes of the stairs.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hard building do not want unknown materials.
\"We wanted to work with recycled materials,\" said Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre of thickness has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're making time.
The membrane ending is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the Landbouwplastic (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the mountain top.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee offers an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot figs.
The latter create an atmosphere, but mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the literal mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
\"It's incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model project on ecology,\" Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted through the glass façade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated stores are loading the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as the finally found soul of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully garnished (today, it counts 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
Rays are overflowing everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, \"there's nothing worse than a half-empty library\"
“I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration -
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, the creation of an identity.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: -Germans must play a greater role -
Germany chose abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without being overly critical of Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an area of air exclusion.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they still cheat to find this role, but they're on the road to a more normal foreign policy.
External policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What does the term \"normal\" foreign policy mean to the Germans in practice?
It shows the desire to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first had important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care not to strike public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a key element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany neglect its relationship with the United States by choosing abstention in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even Germany will only be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly demonstrates a great understanding of the European position.
But given the country's political configuration, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot, therefore, register within a broader political line and must affirm their individual position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will in future take a role as a locomotive and will move Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relationship with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I believe the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that is more important to their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a leading role on the international stage, but does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If one looks at, for example, the euro crisis, it is observed that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very diverse neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only diminishes, but right now the EU does not fill this vacuum, but who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he has specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
\"Mark protection\" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially filed in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such as the company bearing the name of the trade mark cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd get cause gain.
\"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,\" says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing's office specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to be able to record their brands.
So instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports products.
Pattloch opens a classer in which the records made at the Beijing brand office are found.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriateing part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a fact known that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are several-storey shopping centers that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his commanders charged him with addressing the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of \"Bang Mingpai\" as a relative.
The term is derived from \"Bang Dakuan\"
It is with this term that women are appointed to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to blame for.
\"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend,\" Pattloch demands.
\"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous\"
Financial losses and costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive light products.
According to market analysis company CLSA data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable records from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a \"market reality\"
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the Hong Kong and Singapore plagiars who had reorientated the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have passed last year from a \"emergency situation in the course of the work to a found normality\"
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Act on cost
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and that means that China is for the tenth consecutive time ahead of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of right of registration.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Indeed, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the immitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
\"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany,\" says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities management in Munich.
The trade marks office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won cause gain from the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Watchfulness is on the move
Today, the case is pending with the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: - the procedure is long, trying and it costs us a lot of time and money -
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing side a six-digit ‘large sum in euro’ to settle the dispute.
\"That's what we see what this represents for us,\" says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overwhelm Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region were to ensure the operation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “The watch is on the move.
Pattloch and advises German companies to be very cautious in their business relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law that foreigners should, rather, also register in China everything that is likely to be protected, as Wenzler said.
Otherwise, the costs may be much greater than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay the opposing party licence rights for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: Taper du leg, sing, help
Imbongi's choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland's AIDS rejoice in their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, scarps for ladies and moccasins for men are looking for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they take, bow and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor loses almost his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild suppleness.
It's Monday night, Chorale Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came, from geneticist to human medicine to man at home.
\"Om'Obani\" is not an easy piece, every chorister has different words, the whole in a very exotic language: the zoo, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association -Voices for Africa -
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means in a zoo - story teller - or even more - a singer of praises -
No one can speak Bantu language commonly in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany for now to her native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40 per cent of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or ground huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, there is a smaller scale of damage to Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland has immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the Chorale had been able to discover the village. Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street to whom he was not only missing parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who committed themselves to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal each day.
But barely a year later, the chorale founded, voices for Africa, an association that has since taken almost professional care of the orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydiades and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
The current STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic and gale lice belong to the parasitic IST.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhaging often occur among men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonasis, candidiasis (fongic), blennorrhagia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of the new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess at the level of the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, lower back pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptom and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect oneself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who frequently changes sex partners regularly undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly disposed STIs can be cured and late sequelae may be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially the funds that the choristers reap through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
\"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,\" says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandparents.
The gogos, this is what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is greeted in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just like the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, \"Voices for Africa\" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the assistance of the US Health Organization PSI, the association has organized an HIV testing test for many people.
This is not self-evident, for even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo topic.
A King and His Wives 14
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that affects sexuality.”
She's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned motherhoods, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, we find condoms at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, \"but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.
In order to promote cultural exchange a little, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it produces not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also draws a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their girls.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
\"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there,\" people say.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres flying bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of those choristers who knock on the foot in the repetition room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal Science
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one has a link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
Discovery could help to understand how water and other life-essentials have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unaware of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a \"planet\" according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a \"family gate\" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the \"new-borns\" in the universe's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where the stars were born, named \"W5\", a very unRomantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The beech-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Nebula Trifide, at 5,400 light years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, star lovers also called - the seven sisters - can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years into the constellation of the Verseau.
Its similarities with a land continent have earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving trace.
One of the largest and most clean photographs the Hubble telescope has taken is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the dye, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Austral Observatory shows the Nebulae of the Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word \"trifidus\" (divided, divided into three), because three drags of dust divide the glowing heart from the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomers photographed the premixes of a cosmic snail in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light years of Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rushing towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its Southern Firewheel nickname -
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Cephea.
The nebula lies at 1,400 light years and is composed of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo has been developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
The circle consists of black holes, which is 430 million light-years from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy - GC 1810 -
In this nebula is the most luminous group of young stars in our lactated path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars at 5,000-year-old light from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and perched from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed of a large part of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further into the universe.
For 30 years between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescope Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Wide Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter reaches about 11 meters.
The drawback of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI, or “extraterrestrial intelligence research) by contributing the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a very large telescope, a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO website in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They were holding two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the images of the most important space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will have the task of finding the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercure also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exist, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
The radar data have for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of one country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of one country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The journey to Talysh Mountains is of a romantism set in motion.
The small bus rides along the wooded hills, river rivers and small farms around the road.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group lives of the name Talysh, about which we do not know much, unless they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small square town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not completely agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilatea Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
\"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world,\" says Fatulayeva.
She is director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having still one child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest documented person was 122, the age of Müslmov seems more than questionable.
\"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,\" says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man at the great age of Central Asia.
\"Some surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,\" says Scholz, \"also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old.\"
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the absence of documents, without counting that there was no record of civil status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, people in the Lerik area often reach a age worthy of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the southern part of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh’s calorie-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is this the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, viva Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a barata, which it beats the content untiringly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one girl, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little kids slumbering in the house as well.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped cabinet glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf they hide long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
\"I've never used shampoos,\" Mirzayeva added.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
For the rest of my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything improved when the \"well-loved father\" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is surprising in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no bounds in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euro) monthly for retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps for a long time the grinning son of Mirzayeva was right: \"The elders enjoy great respect in our culture\"
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
Human rights - omitted in the Constitution
The revolution returns to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The President of Egypt is not overwhelmed with words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
\"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,\" he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for the Christian Coptics, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular.
Because all members of the opposition confused and desperately dismayed are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi almost apologized for temporarily restricting the powers of the Constitutional Court and broadening its powers - in order to save the revolution -
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what it wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the U.S. University of South California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the assembly constituting mostly Islamic of 100 people in a 15 hour night tour of force are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that jurisprudence is based on - the principles of Islamic law -
But what does the word \"principles\" really mean?
That was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and legal margin of manoeuvre that derives from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it gives the idea of a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all the subjects related to the Sharia, the University of Al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts used to suppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, as it is possible to read in the project, protect - the true nature of the Egyptian family - and - promote its morals and values -
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would just be censorship.
Furthermore, no articles expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the wording allowing us to understand that it is forbidden to \"offence people\"
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will soon be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
\"The revolution was reborn.\"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it enters into force.
\"The revolution is born and we are going to win,\" Hamdin Sabbahi launched, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is - to be thrown into the trash cans of history -
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a \"putsch against democracy\"
\"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,\" exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
\"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired,\" said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
\"The Qur'an is our Constitution\"
For his part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square by precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the salafists, who participated in them in large numbers, chanted: “The people demand the application of the law of God”
“Clean our country,” they asked Morsi, stating that “the Koran [was] their Constitution”
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballots of the leadership of the country.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
\"Human rights are not mentioned only once\"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
\"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution,\" he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are serious violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
\"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers from him - she deplores Saeda.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A protestant on Tharir Square warns: \"You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control\"
Norway's rakfisk: is this the most odorful fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, imprints the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-spoiled trout and fermented in the water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
\"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,\" says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local fireman also called \"Rakfisk General\" who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and stuff themselves a lot of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking kills the smell.
I'm trying out a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof water barrels in the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses softened by alcohol - food.
To the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrants to the United States.
Now, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although odoring, of Norway's past.
It's from the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to please it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they're talking about the \"July 22 incident\"
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that in their peaceful country one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” Anna explains, our waitress, with the blonde hair and with the eyes of a transpiring blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to point out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, except for a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its tight stock exchange.
\"As much as you can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we are happy,\" Anna says.
\"Don't forget the rakfisk - it adds in a careless laugh.
I stand in the snow and do the tail to buy me what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, an elk burger, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where you can use rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
\"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains\"
\"Here are our points, Havard -
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult departure.
As the President enters Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the challenges facing him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where traffic jams are a normal legion, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to their jobs, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is fine, and results are due to President Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
\"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,\" said Mr. Pena Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico before he sided with the U.S. President.
A very populous and tentacled state that encloses the capital. In its predilection land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises give it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made on these roads, once forested and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
\"We rely on him to put in place lasting changes,\" said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of unimpaired power, the PRI was issued in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who reproach the new president for lack of charism.
He is a whole man, very engaged, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent stateman and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a sinister area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the verge of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to solve the problem of the murders committed against women when he was on duty.
At worst, they accuse its administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this weak neighborhood, Irina Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I came home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed out,” says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and cadaver rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been refused.
The authorities treated me like I was an oldcomer, a trouble-maker, a crynicheuse.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
\"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,\" she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his saturday scarf, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has made the promise that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
\"I hope he will be as good as when he was governor,\" said Olvera in Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors declare.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning was allegedly the victim of incarceration.
The trial involves Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to rank the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was made in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- had missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request demanding that the Manning case be classified on the ground that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was \"excellent\" and that the treatment he had had in prison was generally \"very professional\"
The forms did not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers questioned him directly about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
\"They wrote -- no problems -- (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems,\" Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend his restrictive status indicating a \"risk of injury\"
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted this status to be removed... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and escaped once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
\"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in this cage,\" said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the most light of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were mattresses, blankets, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, as sleeping or staying lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also specified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, too, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his testimony of Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deducted from his guard's order that he should have dropped his cover which could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let it go.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but that he did not.
That night Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty to the less serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the charges are dismissed, he will be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My mexico-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the Mexicans, one for the \"Mexicans\", another for the \"Foreigners\" and \"Foreigners\".
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me to.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the \"Mexican\" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as my friends in Boston use when they say \"Irish\" or \"my friends\" in New York when they say \"Italian\"
Then I became \"Mexico-Americans\"
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, no need for special qualification or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the \"Foreigners\" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when leaders of both countries meet, their themes of choice are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans should stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wished to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand in writing half of their territory to the point of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to approach the topic of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream we live in, not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite in the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they touch us as if we were individuals with a lower strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexican Americans are opposed to it.
Although an American citizen, she has a feeling of being a member of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of any country or other country.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely need to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much amortism.
And, given the inequalities in pay, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself, fellas.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of America for the way they treated Mexico a century ago and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still wish them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more \"Mexicans\" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is undergoing a full change.
The Arab Spring has made everything exploded, and whether it is desired or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there is every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A War That Does No Loser or No Winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to display optimism.
Although the cease-fire granted on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be horrified by forcing the Israelis to quit, even though Gaza had a race.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world Islamists is increasing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken action and cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas members jubilee and say that the Islamist croissant runs around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily turned to public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even from Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hardline will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put in a box.
The missile interception system named Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unfailing support; and many European countries have reproached Hamas for the origin of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, including under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket shootings in Gaza had killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel had been spared from suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, which protected Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicist party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian figs pain in giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as their heads come out.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take it; but it may be that the Arab Spring changes it.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is of good luck -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a rot that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - somewhat like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bleeding missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give the outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the flow of arms to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very bizarre vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Acts for neutral cigarette packages entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco-packing regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by suppressing all glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% chance that they will never start.
\"Even when they are very young, children include the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,\" said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.\"
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have stated that this would revive the trade in the black market, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
\"Damn consequences will result from this legislation,\" said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia's fakes will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on Australia's streets.
Others stated that this law had energized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette case, especially in silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has grown a lot two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in front of Australia's high court.
Ha stated that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, things are good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the proportion of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you are working in tobacco marketing and have only a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the site that is unique to excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who adores Marlboro cigarettes and who has been worth making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibsek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
\"You take a cigarette and you put the package on,\" said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a picture of the tumor of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get stopped is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the \"King of the Pack tobacconist\" in central Sydney, said that packaging uniformity made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
\"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,\" Yu said.
\"The government had only to ban them once for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we stop and we put the key under the door,\" he added, raising our arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts who specialize in child development praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths or to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the boredom.
So should we welcome the trouble with open arms?
Yes.
Not you.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of \"Boredom: A Lively History\" (Yale University Press, 2011).
\"The trouble goes back to very far,\" he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to the boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After having gone through many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that consists of wanting to do something, but without getting involved in a satisfactory activity.
What differentiates the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly -
The boredom can very much look like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think that we're getting bored while it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, \"The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention\" was published in the journal \"Perspectives on Psychological Science\" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group did not quite hear the soundtrack.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said that they had become more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to trouble.
When trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to trouble, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, as you look at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not to get bored.
In fact, he said, at present, we know that when we torture or griffon, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to remain physically more alert.
\"Study has shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to remain unmoved,\" said Professor Fensk.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monorecorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Predisposition Scale to the Troubles” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, \"Through the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,\" and -I have so many centers of interest that I don't have the time to do everything -
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemous.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development teacher at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of today's boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that \"adolescence is a time when the boredom reaches its highest level,\" particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question, is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets, or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have referred to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
\"The boredom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else,\" said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-regulation, says Professor Fensk.
And this self-regulation moves from one situation to another, he states.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
As I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling that generates the activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
\"We need to get bored more often, but the bore awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,\" he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy stopping times.
\"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,\" he added, \"it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.\"
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
\"We are being treated as criminals,\" said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana have been classified without further delay.
Police services have ceased to charge 21-year-olds and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for the speeding up of existing marijuana cases and continue to blame the people who own them.
At the same time, several towns from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales in their neighbourhoods.
\"Things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us,\" said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking themselves some questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is wanted or not, is ahead of most of the regulation states on marijuana, first of all regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now regarding personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
\"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,\" he said.
The Washington Law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees appropriate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or daycare.
\"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,\" said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a newly formed research group.
On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the \"City attorney\" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer pursue 21-year-olds and over who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this type of crime - to the immediate effect -
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement new judicial decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the \"district atorney\" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, mainly in order to put pressure on users to get disinfected.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
\"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence which, at the time of the act, was a recognized offence,\" said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to rank all cases of marijuana detention without follow-up.
“I don’t feel like wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, offering a legal and government framework appropriate to personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalentness among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
\"This is a cultural barrier - with the representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
\"They have spent a lot of their lives prosecuting people who consume marijuana, too, they have trouble accepting that it is legal,\" he said.
As the first states to treat the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are now becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives provide for a new border of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still conceive of the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not go down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is strong to bet that they are opposed to the licensed sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and this ban should be imposed next week.
\"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we're facing a federal problem,\" said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than in the state's vote.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mean and excluded from Oxford, because I was a \"Tory\" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was an eminent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with faction that I was gone after being forced to drink in steep cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away because I had been the victim of intimidation and was the subject of constant jokes.
Not because of my rather bizarre name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do you mention this today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of middle-right students undergoes the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have required protection of their rights, as have gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the student room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were \"often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted\" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent BBC Two-Wonderland documentary: Young, Bright and on the Right - - The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right -, devoted to student politics, and which depicted the \"Tories\" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moved to Rolls-Royce, was discovered there and moved with a chrome-headed barrel.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats of the establishment of an increase in school fees -
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us -
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is \"uncomfortable\" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of JCR members towards people who are of centre-right.
\"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members,\" she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The conservative party's hatred was very virulent.
In the previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the week's home, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in sarcasms against Tory students, but that in addition, they took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on child care, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm to which I was the victim concerned a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
\"Miss Wyatt,\" said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), \"let's translate the first paragraph.\"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was taking it easy.
\"The Thatcherists refuse to learn French or they are just stupid,\" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
\"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - at last, if you are not too busy making friends - he has launched a gruesome tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a student in the second year of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
\"I know who you are,\" he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's how it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour.
Later, in the local pub, I let go of trying to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That scheme failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political and economic sciences who ironically studied in Eton said: \"You are the daughter of a fascist pig\"
You're contaminated.
Other students picked up the reef.
I was perverted, you bastard.
\"How the Tories make love,\" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet with people sharing the same points of view only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and give up my opinions?
The next three years would look like an ostracism and isolation purgatory.
The only open teacher tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was an outside politician of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
\"You won't be happy here,\" he said.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelief.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
\"But it's the best place in the world,\" he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had unreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's for teasing you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a working session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was - an enemy of the people - I decided to do the same.
Roasting internally with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them like ‘bad fools’.
The record was short-lived.
It's my father who sunk the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers quit.
When they left, I packed my bag and took the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can treat me like wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoyed an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
-Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety -
As part of the exhibition \"Valentino: a Master of the Couture\", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian seafarers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seammaker recognized it during the inauguration of Valentino: a Master of the Couture - a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high seam models created for its sewing house over the past 50 years.
\"I love this palace,\" he declared with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is Mr Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and pictures signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest seafarer of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
\"At least they don't crush their cigarette minglings on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do,\" says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and received with generosity and elegance.
\"We all loved to be invited to his chalet of Gstaad,\" explains the ex-wife of \"Heini-Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charism of the seammaker.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Spain in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
\"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated,\" recalls the \"top model\" which began working with him during the High-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
- It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art - it ends.
Definition of nobility line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He likes people very high and with the greatest titles and they love it as well.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a 60-metre-long glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must ride on the podium to admire a \"public\" dream depicting Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor who chose Jackie Kennedy for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in -The Night - or a woolen and fur coat that belonged to the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these mannequin audiences are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the seammaker in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love - impossible to forget -
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest, and a jacket from the 1971-1972 fall-winter collection.
\"It's a gift he gave me,\" said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's muses.
\"I prefer it to everyone else for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty,\" adds Feria's ex-duchess.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modest Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot, also, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flyer skirt, a drape buster and a drop-off.
\"It was a dream come true,\" said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless” explains Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the nightdresses with the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all of the souvenirs she travels -
Fashion leechers
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25-racazze (the seammaker calls his seams) to perform this ivere silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different teeth and a four-and-a-half-metre stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late 20th century - the return of the customers of the high society -
Relianced for years by the \"being\" of nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honner, Garavani has as many honors as any husband of his clients.
\"They are refined, their calm, their neat and perfect look have always jumped me in the eye,\" Arenberg admits.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the Jacqueline countess table in Ribes, one of my great friends.
\"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him\"
If she's a princess who says so...
The toughest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas from the earth's entrances solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 kilos in total, it installs them in two bamboo baskets that it loads on its shoulders across the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which peaks at 2,386 meters high, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to grave this distance, with a tortuous look, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who had a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once on the top, he wandered among tourists who photographed them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walked the 3 kilometers up to the balance sheet that a mining company installed a little in contrabass at 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) as it is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten the sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
\"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),\" says the carrier who once worked as a mason on Bali's tourist island.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but then he returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as undisputed as the sulphur: \"I married a daughter of Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought him back to Java to convert to Islam\"
Then he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
\"I'm going to work two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French - he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Misleaded by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood massage with other carriers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop blushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defiant the darkness, Antonio descends into the crater by shining with a small lamp attached to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (250 euros) of increase by camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
\"This work is done for beasts, not for humans,\" protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left the college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working - as long as he can - because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets are obviously added.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only charge 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions and he were able to extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of goats invaded by the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik says, opening my mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur bearer.
Time passes, but the perpetual poverty of generation by generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on careers, stress and the cost of access to property.
-The population of Singapore must develop -
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and we give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to it, the video has spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as \"Let's put a cop in the drawer\" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency of the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their national duty.
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we said the following: what more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered to be the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to a \"best education\" and a wider choice of career opportunities.
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that support a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, particularly Chinese people who are accused of taking wages down and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as \"shoe box\", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the El Developers real estate company, claims that its shoeboxes are selling much faster than larger housings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to the promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
If such new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate by discussing with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people give it back later,” says a young setting.
Other people can have children.
\"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and time,\" says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons why they are prevented from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What's off-line private is online private
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or the private area of life that we can protect from any intrusion.
What is the private domain for under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses by spreading events he would certainly not share online on the Internet?
The newspaper elPeriodic interrogated five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term - something very personal - on a personal level and - the password and the username - when they applied it to social networks.
“I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” Jorge says, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I place nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
\"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would make a fool,\" he says.
The young boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, undeclared people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority of them are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
\"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them in,\" he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly,” he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
Joseph's case, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
\"It doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example music,\" he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances to him or asked him for his address or his phone number.
\"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account,\" he acknowledged.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharclement are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
\"He never knew who it was,\" he said.
The victim, José said, didn't close his account.
\"He only passed it on a private profile\"
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to safely set up his account.
Unlike Jorge, he would post pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
\"Even if I know it's cyberharclement,\" he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
\"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,\" she says.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book \"Natives and Digital Immigrants\", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who are born with technology.
\"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are ourselves learning,\" she says.
It adds that the theme is complex, because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity necessary to do so.
\"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,\" she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
\"They say not to do it is useless,\" she says.
Next, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you identify party photos, ask others permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
\"Now on the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, so it must be on social networks,\" she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and education adviser, says that it is essential for parents to consciously read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each term, they will have strong bases for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
\"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,\" he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not speak to foreigners.
Unassur's summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VIE Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
On several occasions he tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit was closed, and then stated that it would be published from one moment to the other on the Peruvian government's website.
When they were questioned about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the private, restricted audio message was broadcast in the press room.
The limited information circulated among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, except for the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the \"final declaration\" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru hosted the 3rd Arab South America Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it had been urged by the press, it had also not broadcast the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima tried against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague.
\"We will respect and execute the verdict which will resolve the disputes that we are bringing to this international court today,\" said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
\"Chili has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of the controversies, treaties and international tribunals,\" President Piñera added, giving a hand to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was assigned to open the proceedings in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document announcing that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set in place important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements -
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to drugs, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to assess the risks of natural disasters jointly and effectively -
With a Europe in crisis, - economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix, but must help increase our productive matrix and create a better future for our people - President Humala concluded.
\"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,\" said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five related to Peru and were on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
\"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the South American Union, which it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
\"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,\" said President Santos.
\"We are going to revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with that country,\" he stressed.
\"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible,\" President Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they have planned to attend the takeover of the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which attempts to strengthen the defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has the temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which South America, in this case, should take an example of Europe.
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that Europeans - had been interviewed during World War II - and in other conflicts, but that they were now almost a homeland -
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship promoted by the countries members of Unasur.
\"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to in the past,\" he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José covenant on human rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
\"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States,\" he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not himself betrayed his principles, but instead has respected his deep democratic values and human rights.
He concluded that at the time, “there were grounded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected”
In addition, he criticizes Swedish justice, which required him to submit on his territory to an interrogation of a alleged sexual offence, while — Swedish legislation itself allows him to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done since the Ecuadorian Embassy in London —
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health might deteriorate.
\"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious,\" said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“This acts on the health of anyone” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the allocation of a non-conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and stresses that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
\"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because counsel of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with various European bodies,\" he mentioned.
And he thinks that if Britain granted the safe conduct from tomorrow, it would be over.
And if Sweden, as its legislation completely allows, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Ecuador embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this in order to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he said that what he would not tolerate was - the poor, the bad faith and the lies that damage freedom of expression -
\"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,\" he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists - not the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador - and, rather than putting forward his re-election, he would deepen the revolution in order to continue the path and track the right path -
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization - should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempts to coup d'état disguised - for in reality, - would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy -
What is more, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be solved as a whole in order to get past them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed his confidence in the good resolution of the dispute over maritime borders that opposed Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was good for Latin America to take the international courts if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment that it was -
Referring to the eventuality of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility - with a great deal of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult -
Correa claimed that if he lost primary school in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
\"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility,\" he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I'll do it too.
\"It's my decision,\" he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just discussed with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
\"This does not mean a relapse of President Chavez's health status,\" he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur), which ended with an appeal for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the test result: seropositive.
\"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head,\" he said, referring to the time of the announcement, \"that the doctor had tried to make \"less painful\" in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and his harassment was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV unit patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying to him again - because he was voiceless -
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, (exhausted) their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, - the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same - indicated the leader of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he notes that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a 500 CD4 rate.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who will receive a positive diagnosis of HIV at 25 years of age, since he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age, explained the questioned scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that Mexican life expectancy is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has significantly decreased in recent years in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to UNAIDS's annual report), it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years or so, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact - nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to carry out early diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to propose testing in a massive way, to all those who ask for it -
The specialists and members of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree with its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his early age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
\"If I'm going to die, I'd better blow three times a week,\" they say, \"it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, her parents only know that she has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
\"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person,\" says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World Day against AIDS.
Let them test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Conservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, - we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but, as a result, still today, some do not have access to condoms - he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: \"What are you going to do about it?\" asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; not only are condoms sold to counters, but they are found in public toilet distributors and in places where young people live.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying girls and motels, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked whether there would be a condom distribution in his administration.
\"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to those already sexually active,\" he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
13.435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV) are reported.
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contaminations are done sexually, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the stellar banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the North Texas District leaves Mexican corporations defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to seize the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of Commercial Law International had been created to that end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the inter-corporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed debts.
Furthermore, what is certain is that since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say, the funds (Vautour) such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the costs of the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance will require non-prosperity and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the Amicus Curiae - a friend of the Court - in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, pointing out that it would release it from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it into line with paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has failed to comply with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcáraga Andrade, have been brought under silence for several months, the latter being accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Sindicale des Pilotes Aviadores has already encountered problems.
The court, which Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to remove from bank IXE F/589 198 million pesos from the bank on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase stocks from the Hotel Professional Administration.

The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain in what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contrection Commercial Agreement, known under his English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor -Hetin - Reyes - Basketball is my whole life -
The globe-trotter of the basketball-Hetin-Reyes has spent more than 60 years in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as that of Hector-Hetin-Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
\"I wore several helmets in the basketball all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s,\" Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
- Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his journey away from standards, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those who remind him of his passing as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“This was my best years, the ones I took most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been rewarding for many years, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, \"Cuco-Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team,\" says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a leader here at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: \"I have a tough player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it.
It's like starting Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to me Raymond Gauss, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I recall that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gauss would help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gauss, but only remotely, since in 1988 he was already the great manite of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's and Mincy's burdens on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we put a rally on the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and \"Piculín\" (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) - Toñito - Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario -Quijote - Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like -Canito - Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it's Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for John Ross Ewing's main role, better known as J.R., in the television series \"Dallas\", in which he embodied a man of business without scruples, reproducible and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series \"Dallas\" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned to J.R.'s role this year in a new season of \"Dallas,\" died Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of \"Dallas\"
\"Larry was back in her dear hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most,\" said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and later was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, declared his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life in depth,” Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver surgery in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized a lot of drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant tumor in the liver and suffered a transplant.
Several years before -Dallas - Hagman became known on television as an ordinary type in the series -Jinny of my dreams - broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short of time in the antenna, \"The Good Life\" (NBC, 1971-72) and \"Here We Go Again\" (ABC, 1973).
His roles in the cinema include roles that are well received by criticism in \"The group \"Harry and Tonto\" and \"Primary Colors\"
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman knew of his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan - Who killed J.R. -, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations worldwide and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made \"Dallas\" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of \"MASH\" in 1983, which gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made him pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to assault him.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupt and unsatisfying man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
\"I know what would have to be the epitaph for J.R.\" said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: \"This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing\"
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered Hagman's Friday as a man's - immense, both on the small screen and in life -
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of \"Dallas\" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is being carried out, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither Warner nor the TNT channel have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows celebrity with classic works such as \"South Pacific\" and \"Peter Pan\"
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to counsel Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the theatre scenes in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities resided.
In 2001, he called his memoirs \"Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life\" (in French: Hello Darlin': The Impotyable Memories of J.R)
\"I have written nothing in this book that can hurt someone or affect him in any way whatsoever,\" he said to the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist restless patients.
\"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to operate and then - he told them in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, \"Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be fine.\"
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the \"End of the World\" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of the Stuart Charmé religion decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was making an irresistible joke there: the end of the \"great count\" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, which many refer to as proof of the end of the impending world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some have nicknamed - the Armageddon of debt - and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of time thought the apocalypse would start.
\"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known,\" said Professor Charming to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give lessons about -the end of the world - this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker dispenses the \"Media, Culture and the End of the World\" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
\"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,\" he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If the nuclear weapon fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
\"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,\" said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply called \"The End of the World\"
\"We add \"2012 - to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear,\" said Professor Restall.
Despite the impending disaster, students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work - until the very night of the supposed end of the world - said Restall.
Courses have been quite popular.
“It was completed in two hours,” Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I am fascinated by what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all apocalyptic films.
\"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject,\" he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less of a teacher, told us to believe at the end of the world on December 21.
\"Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy, and in a way we disagreed with it,\" says Julie zegle, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety linked to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
\"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it,\" he said.
This is a majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that lessons about the end of the world were being given here.
\"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,\" he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there have been many alleged dates of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, - people will immediately begin to think about the next date - or to philosopher about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they were thinking of going to parties - from the end of the world -
\"At times, I call friends and we laugh together,\" said 20-year-old Samira Ford.
