What does it matter? ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new councillors of the ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the evident language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed colleagues of the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period - examined - the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the best known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
\"Who is Voldemort?\"
The truth is, I don't know.
“I’m rather a novice in the pragenary politics,” he said during the terminology exam of “collegueo” the cultural councilman Lukaš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept - golf hoyo -
\"Maybe it's the only expression of everyone you asked me to use from time to time.\"
‘If not, usually in employment slang —
From the glossary, whose definitions published by Aktualně.cz last June before the ODS polling conference, the editorial chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts - Voldemort - - - Prague's biggest golf hole - - go to the pastry shop - - bullock - - - capital traction - and - armor -
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
\"I don't get involved in these things, and I don't think about how the democratic civics are fun.\"
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the implementation of our programmes,” he said.
As has been seen, councillor Lukaš Kaucký had allegedly not realized that the above title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word \"Voldemort\" does not say anything; the only term that hit the exam is - the largest golf hole in Prague -
“It’s the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucký, adding immediately: “But I do know for the news.”
\"I'm going to have to point to a language course - joke.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councilman Lukaš Plachý.
Afterwards, both socio-democratics know who Voldemort and Lukaš Plachý really is, even knows where to find that character; furthermore, they suspect the meaning of - going to the pastry shop -
\"I think it means going to a company in Prague - it soon reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-Democrats.
\"I asked my comrades, but it really seems that we have nothing like it.\"
\"Well, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we play word games with names,\" says ČSSD president pragénse, Petr Hulinský, whose matchmates call Hulda.
\"At school, I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my fellows call me that too,\" says Karel Březina.
The Aktualně.cz newspaper tested the name and worked.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to -yayo - or, less friendly, Dědek - old -), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the elections deceptions during the party sponsorship, receives the adop of -Igráček - - playmobil - by some of his peers.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the socio-democratic tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský does not like that they call him Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz has discovered even other points for this pragening president.
\"The doctor of the rights of the bitches\" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the \"Jews\" as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be older, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The women who return are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
\"Men rarely suffer such a sin.\"
“It is also not acceptable for healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from her communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual social measure.
He issued an informative booklet that should help avoid witch hunt.
However, this has a stick.
More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read - the Die Standard newspaper warns about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Witchcraft charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah, 72 years old, died when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
He set himself on fire when the group wanted - to expel the bad spirits - from the woman.
Insulation of the \"brides\" is supported by people at all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul devourers have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved in it.
\"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large witch hunt that supposedly had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by black magic\"
\"To help him brought to the flames of nearby Guinea, which, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, were forcibly brought to the attention of men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the ownership of the president in Kanilai,\" says Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, arrested people had to drink a pocima of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally freed about a thousand people in detention.
Bakala tenant: warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, aged and reticent, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty of the coal-magnate company Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
All three of them just took over the liberalisation of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner per month, the child will pay from the next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room flat with second-class separate kitchen.
\"In addition, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler - it shows with the finger the man in his son's new contract, on whose signature has full powers.
\"But I signed it\" explains a half angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which described the new rental conditions as - incorrect and indecent - recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes one neighbor.
\"Anything says one thing,\" he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
So Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the \"laboratory\" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number-taking machine.
“Require 2011” can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a paperboard with a number comes out of the machine.
It almost gives no time or time to read -157 - and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as requests for settlement, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in rental of between 15 and 38%.
A special window opens on 18 November at the customer service centre for new rentals.
\"It's been working for a week, so it's starting to start,\" the workers who are in it are briefly questioned when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old Bakala mining floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, has already treated them high and clear, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
\"Twenty years later I want a new soil\"
“I was not changed by the damn toilet dish,” the man mentioned in the introduction was released.
According to the workers, for the moment they come more than nothing retired to check if they receive a rental discount if they sign on time, as promised the special RPG offer.
They will also receive half of the February rental discount for the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the \"liberalization\" window, or mine, has certainly failed to dispel the flood of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for rent in 2011 about forty-fifty people,” estimates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties do not reach agreement on rent, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
\"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,\" RPG warns on its pages.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says RPG Byty’s employee and a man on the street in front of the customer service center, at least in part, gives him reason.
\"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts,\" he says.
But immediately the employee sows doubt.
\"We'll see\"
\"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the media that they don't sign, so people may wait,\" he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
The current rents still do not cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community's fund, recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's residential portfolio, which adds that the careless state of the community's fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that occurred between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5,200 million.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
“The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties”
\"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7,50 Czech crowns per square metre per month\" is indicated on the screen.
Only 38% increase the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square metre,” says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will climb from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rental (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rental up agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides a small nursery within himself to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outer terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can come to her.
The company of architectural projects Arch.Design, of which numerous well-known buildings came out of Brno, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint to include a space for its mini-guard.
The company works around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and delineators to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, kindergarten is one of the benefits Arch offers.Design to his workers within the framework of his social programme.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch's own employees.Design and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as from the Czech State budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a total of more than 2.8 million Czech krona) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When it exhausts funding (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-guard running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the submission of the funding application contributed to the company Economy Rating.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; moreover, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. She would now host children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a \"miniguardy\" it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they go further during the day.
The functioning of childcare is flexible in order to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use childcare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the usual preschool education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally leads to a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The bone house continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it - the bone house -
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order are observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is lit in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of forms continue to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies the frames of windows, bars, door decorations, mirrors and signs.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the remodeling of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of performing a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the House Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated in the design the architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and mosaics used on the facade appeared in his project plans.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell Park of Gaudí, in which there are other pieces of it.
Because of their organic form, the locals soon after their completion nicknamed it - the bone house -
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it - the house of the woods -
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron saint of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange for your tilt of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not fully respect the construction standards of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the municipality was so impacted by the result it requested to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city council's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without giving up the necessary privacy for intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sun rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or found out, that this is a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and the buchtilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí constructions into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed environment with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some residents of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men seek different things
Nothing of a pompous bed frame; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to fall, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must complement perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election, many elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are -heated - more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the channels of the center are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep in the moisture. Even mold may appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence customs.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling well on a lower, harder surface.
\"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep like good here.\"
\"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer\"
“This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have long problems with the nervous system, so they get bad information from the joints and the skin,” says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in sheltered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have taken time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
\"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempor and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic brand\"
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate viscoelastic.
This -- a thousand -- works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
Just get better sleep.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
\"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you fall face up, you should have your hands comfortably shuddered towards your elbows - advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouníkŭ to dekoraterā, who has been dealing for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, which teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combining the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the mice at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with a minimum of 15 cm of inside springs, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
“When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, the docks should certainly not be noticed” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a particular type of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your ass, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start reminding us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life of the mattress up to 25 years old or even of a guarantee of life.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattresses are currently manufactured with zip closure throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and washing size!), their manipulation in the larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress may seem a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm board?
Never!
Like a lot for beds designed to spend a night visiting.
However, it must do (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes in the table and must be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable strips containing between 14 and 18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses may be used (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always best a somier with a larger number of foils, 28 or more, in which the strips of the lumbar area are reinforced and its rigidity can be regulated.
Somies of articulable foil should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection may also be used.
This is a special fixation of the blades that allows you to press or even tilt the blades so that -round - perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the -masculine - began to use a softer area just around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres with cross-structure or tabillas with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, even if you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (great and - mature -) you will disappear most of the advantages.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the side of the pillow, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest area of the mattress) than the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with, it seems, original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to increasingly use natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, made of polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils, for example rice or soybeans.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers employ soybeans.
‘Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is manufactured only of materials of natural origin’ explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattresses, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are \"cooled\" with plant extracts of breeze, so that the mattress bottom absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer \"heat\" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warm.
The favorites today?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role usually have lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and somries.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory memory memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a large density began with Tempor's cosmic material.
Initially it appeared as material for NASA, because during the takeoff astronaut loas were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempor softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent the onset of sores, but also to improve the comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents employ people’s tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed to track vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a zip box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of trespassing on your privacy.
“We all try to say that it is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices in the Czech market.
\"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we haven't met with such cases yet.\"
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their view, children should always know what the \"box\" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
\"Even younger children show great creativity when intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid them being controlled\"
“Before, parents relied heavily on mobiles, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child carries any type of electronic device that can reveal his/her location”
\"Now it's the phone.\"
\"As the use of tracking devices is extended, it will also seek them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with much publicity.\"
\"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,\" says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedestrian attack.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides monitoring services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the follow-up device is destroyed immediately, its presence can be of assistance.
‘The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period’
If you suffer damage, at least you will facilitate the last position of the person in question.
The most expensive devices include a tilt gauge, so if the person simply slips out and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question, says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile smart phones with navigation, where only special software should be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a smaller cell box or mobile phones.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
\"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device\"
\"Or identify it after a certain amount of time, which can make the police make time,\" he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle monitoring.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough locks to surround all of Czechia, but it only lasts for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of mecha to arrest explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometres of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the wick is two years, four years to the top.
The army bought the explosive gear at the STV Group, i.e. forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of machete saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the military pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided however that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They wanted no exemption from the defence minister Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two metres of macho, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained to Minister Vondra recently because they say that they have barely ammunition for a variety of weapons, thus limiting even the practice of shooting for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
\"I can't understand that I repeatedly buy such amounts of mecha.\"
\"But it's your decision, and no doubt they will know why they act like this.\"
\"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy - supports the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometres of mecha, saying that he will also have stocks of this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the mesh has only a four-year life span and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years old.
“If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, because of possible military criticism, does not want to give his name.
After the completion of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, when he bought 445 kilometres of mecha, he got a discount.
\"We were 60 per cent less expensive than last year's order of 244 kilometres,\" says the spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defense's shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wicks from the police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres in years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the fair amount of ammunition to be exhausted before their useful life is over.
They decided for security reasons for pyrotechnics and, moreover, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of machining can be achieved.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: it will have to be eliminated hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being purchased -barata -
So far I still live on the contacts I got through the competition
The fact that he won the competition - Enterprise of the year - helped Lukaš Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
In the last edition, he won the competition - Enterprise of the year - the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukaš Pytloun loved to travel.
He realized abroad that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal jobs abroad and a credit from the bank bought a house that was half collapsed composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
\"Today, the value-quality relationship of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,\" says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first reconstructed floor to foreign workers.
All the income I earned back into the building, which gradually became a 54-bedroom pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has managed to gradually open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the design hotel of four Pytloun stars.
This year, however, he opened another one of the same quality.
\"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,\" said the number one entrepreneur last year.
“To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped to a large extent to win the 'Empreneurship of the year' contest,” Pytloun said.
Victory increased its fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding areas.
\"People recognized me on the street, still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,\" he recalls.
No doubt, he recommends that everyone try some company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives on contacts and acquaintances who, without the competition, might not have obtained.
- With some people I met thanks to the contest I started to collaborate regularly -
The reputation associated with success, in his view, also included employees,
in total around seventy.
\"I've seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got the overall recognition\"
\"It's not, not much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team.\"
\"Only my name which appears in the foreground,\" says Lukaš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated because of the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition - Enterprise of the year - last year in the \"Slavic House\" of Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a signature with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight competition,” says the winner of last year.
Farmet's history begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žárský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, it did not doubt; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also had a greater presence among the non-specialized public after success in the media competition.
“Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for trade results up to 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, led companies to stop their investment projects and to begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
\"We, of course, are not getting rid of such a situation either.\"
“The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel Žárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all, where Farmet did not cut expenses it was in research and development.
\"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs,\" says Žårský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Žárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous norms
The survey of Absurdity of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey Absurdez of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which staff members can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes, said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the survey Absurdez of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and employers must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is a fourth time part of the corporate tournament of the Hospodářské noviny publication and begins to create a hobby among the general public as well.
While the last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year nearly reached four thousand.
And it's not surprising, since we still have several extra legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in the number of roles required for the tax declaration we are at the top of the world,” comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Employers of the Czech Republic.
For years now, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czechia is in position 74th, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The absurdity contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Any person may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic nonsense every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the “anti-premium” and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
For this year's survey, more than a hundred were submitted, in particular 105 regulations and regulations that are meaningless.
The examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the finalists of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals for this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November in the square of Wenceslao in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Employers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually puts obstacles on employers, so my objective is to eliminate each year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” Martin Kocoursek announced.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in drunk water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to the people was the employer's obligation to communicate in advance of three days to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended secondly in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office of work by its foreign workers on work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's gonna beat her.
The Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two soil scales.
So this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Enterprise responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
\"This way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities,\" says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel competition of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Enterprise’s 2010 main competition, companies were introduced for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, they are for example disabled persons, in others, in the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the company pragense Et Netera software, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main fund contributor for seven years to sponsor disabled children.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperwork that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, as it constitutes more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czechia and in the Vodafone Enterprise competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, did not reduce wages.
The title was also granted because it is primarily purchased by Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce as little impact on the environment as possible,” explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The head IT Enlogit company of the region of Ustí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Person scholarship in trouble, which in particular helps the local Roma community,” says the company representative Ondřej Suchý.
They are also in a good place with a mention of the Praní laundry company to čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact their pension funds.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapáč of the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
‘If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the business contest responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the competition - principal - Vodafone Company of the year -
“The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the year’s main Business contest,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handed over to a local media manager and real estate manager Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the understated land received it as a precise subject.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns for this.
“For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public bidding,” said Právo, the chief prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence public auction, given the limited official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
\"This is a customer, not one of our workers,\" he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called a call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Land Act, and is carried out when a number of interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.
“On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and the Agricultural Fund then transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer,” explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information about who was to be presented for the call and, since he was at the same time interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field who would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, there was so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Later, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historical center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, if not, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families must pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating and, in some cases, higher rents.
As of January, families will have to remove several hundred crowns per month more than now.
Electricity prices increase by 4.6 per cent, gas by about 2 per cent, in some cities will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, due to increased support for renewable energy production, particularly photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderately increasing, especially when heating is most commonly used and therefore higher is consumption.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are increasing throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is primarily planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the houses of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns more per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also be required to bear an increase of 9 per cent of the water price and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the pests will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be increased by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company shall bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10 per cent.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it takes effect slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskies stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care below the age of fifteen.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
\"Beber beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk\"
\"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages,\" said Právo, the head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in downtown Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
\"When they get a bottle from their dad from the bay, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka.\"
“The vodka has the advantage that it is tied with juice and that it doesn’t smell so much,” he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
\"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or rum.\"
\"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren\"
\"In some cases, they use waitress that they took home,\" adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13- and fourteen-year-old drinkers are usually present in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
\"A girl had to enter maybe four times.\"
“He began at 12 years of age when he was brought with 3.5 alcohol in his blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,” says the department’s doctor on this case.
\"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party\"
\"The interesting thing is, his mother didn't even surprise him that his daughter disappeared 48 hours,\" the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increasing alcohol consumption among young people.
The experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of self-dependence.
\"A person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years is understood as an alcoholic, with all the phenomena associated with alcohol, which does not occur in children.\"
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” Chief Pelikán explains.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, 40 Jewish children were hospitalized in the Motol pediatric clinic this year until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who have serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical recognition, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply meet after school and drink spirits, for Pelikán there are three seasonal heights that can be mentioned: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
\"In such circumstances, they drink by bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays\"
\"On the day of the witches I came to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once,\" Pelikán adds.
The drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
\"These carry him much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything.\"
\"Only confused about where they are\" says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose the good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much it cost their drunkenness and that they would have to spend all summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night,” Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a regressive measure, which usually returns to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are first found in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time a device like this is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to fly practical or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, was already taken over last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is still unknown when the planes physically will be withdrawn from Vodochody.
The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from fixed planes long ago, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry.
“The L-159T1 twosomes were exchanged in their current state,” Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army is not left without two-way planes, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 devices that are unnecessary for two-pieces.
One of the new planes has already received it by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
“The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that removes the L-159 aircraft and will serve for NATO country pilot practices”
\"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how they will be used in this framework,\" says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before long that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's Praginate airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than an annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
They could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
\"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age,\" said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as indicated by Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the short right hand index finger than the annular.
They presented the same chances of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with ages below 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be fully demonstrated.
The Czech Republic under the snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on the snow-covered Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the take-off machines circulated throughout the night for many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometres 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ustředního autotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In kilometre 91 a truck was found, in 93 they shocked two industrial vehicles that caused injuries.
A number of tourists also ended up in the cave.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in kilometre 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno in kilometre 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated into kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
Stalls of several kilometres have been formed there.
There has also been an accident on road D11, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow cover of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Docks are being formed for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams circulate late, for example in the line between Karlovo náměsti and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
Problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport closed from eleven on Wednesday night until five in the morning.
At present, it can already move through most of the southern Moravian roads, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska there are a need for chains to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, millers will be required.
For the moment it cannot be said when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is needed in the area of the Karpaty Bílé (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as ČTK indicates.
In Czechia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, plus in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snows gradually return to Czechia.
American soldiers have a new -- smart weapon --
The American army is using a new, intelligent weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that \"change the progress of the game\" would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with an extremely precise pointer.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm gauge ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when it throws its ash from metal cans, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses an intelligent technology.
-The soldiers manipulate it so that they find the goal, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of view and, depending on it, correct the projection line and tighten the trigger -
\"We say that 543 meters have been measured\"
“When the trigger is pressed, the gun loads and throws the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters,” says Audette.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu moved its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighborhood in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, another 100 more employees from the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, \"in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure\"
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region brought joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's chief of economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with that, a \"Global Player\" has been won.
This is a -magnificent recognition at the site -
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost to Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The address previously informed the city of its intention.
“Of course we have offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives caused the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
\"I hope that the owner and the tenant of the building will show themselves cooperative\"
The property formerly used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring-Kleine Vertikale- was part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project to build the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and of a private project company between the station and the town council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticism of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and as regards the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and tax firms, the Software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in Astro Park's office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats Against Assange
The anguish takes on more and more Wikileaks.
The Amazon internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Political pressure may be found behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
Wikileaks' disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted persons, must remain under arrest in Britain, according to one article.
‘Wikileaks kicked out of the Amazon server —
\"To speak freely in the country of freedom,\" the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time) informed the activists of the revelations.
Earlier, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service web in order to cope with the high number of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: \"Perfectly, we will allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe\"
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, - they should stop selling books -
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, the CNN chain was reported according to a call to Lieberman's office.
President of the Senate for Security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British reported - Guardian -
“I had wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified through Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
\"The illegal, monstrous, and unconsidered process of Wikileaks puts at stake our national security and threatens life in the world,\" he said in an independent senator's statement.
-No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted people.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said there have been threats in London.
\"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange\"
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements by North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, he said a head of government counselor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should - be killed - and Obama could - use a drone -
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Assange as \"ridiculum and absurd\" as having requested the resignation of the state secretary, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats recently to engage in espionage tasks.
\"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website,\" Gibbs said.
\"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website\"
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed special manager, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing - the important structural reforms - that are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, Wikileaks should be put at risk.
\"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them,\" said the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
\"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.\"
The University of Ice cream
At the “Gelato University” in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice-creamers has the highest influx and visitors around the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The gelatiere elaborates the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream processing.
The ice cream of the counter's ice cream comes out with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the \"Gelato University\" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines fulfills the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice-creamers has the highest influx and visitors around the world.
There are also more days' special courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the mild ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years' time within an exciting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream teacher Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: “The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that’s why every ball has something romantic”
The first step towards development seems very easy.
Luciano removes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powder milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large batter, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and now cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap on the machine and come out a pasteurized white cream, the base for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be processed only with natural elements or without staticizer?
How can one give relief to some desire to experience?
Luciano advises that they strip themselves of the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream - not just natural ingredients - has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of frijol guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag, and the customer will bite a frozen granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastas.
\"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their goods\"
\"But they must experience it sometimes.\"
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream.
Luciano lets them develop each time four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Whether you know better does not necessarily depend on having more toffe or purer fruit aroma.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to be dried, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the adorable kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is an artimetic problem: The pure melocoton is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of the basic recipe should be lowered.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the fruit types (meditation of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables make the account easier.
Working ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the prepared ice cream mixture and cools at low zero temperature.
Nevertheless, all automation remains outside on small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with pure fruit, as if he were a giant mini-prime without control.
\"In all courses,\" said Master Luciano, \"it's just a matter of time that something like this happens.\"
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority, Efsa, has infiltrated the industry experiencing transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
\"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well,\" said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Ecsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another expert from Efsa have also been engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the verification standards of Ecsa of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticises.
The dispositions of Ephsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without support or the transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which the Office of the General Environment, as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Ephsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided that they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Illisi) in the U.S.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
\"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture,\" says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
\"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you going to find them?\" asked, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, both in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
The industry controls security research - it maintains Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 pounds.
On Monday he was at the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Miles and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As prescribed, most of the wing were wrecked.
Route at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
\"These stones are relics.\"
\"They must not disappear.\"
She's excited: \"A cheap, poor, simple and natural stone\"
As he once said, he has smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier storage of French Navy ammunition, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
\"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the trash,\" he says in his office, a wooden hut that once was a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the remains from the north wing to the company of destroyers.
He spoke to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to use.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-pound cut-off mass, with a price per piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold for some time.
Land of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They arrived everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long since become — the wall — or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
\"In fact, this stone is nothing special,\" Rongen says.
\"If it weren't for the political component\"
He ascends to his all-terrestrial, he makes a tour for his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interesting computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artichokes of chopped sandstones.
\"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke,\" he explains.
White whale, yellow, warm, excited.
\"My dear stone\"
The road crosses the forest.
It points out a lot: Red Arenisca, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
‘Good travertine —
Formerly, the courthouses belonged to the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police station, red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, toba of the Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
\"It would be a scandal if something were to be destroyed.\"
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave it to make the stone dealer, besides canteros, a sculptor, an ironsmith, a glasssmith and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
\"We work hard, but it is satisfactory,\" says the man who is in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Tricking talent around great potentials
There's an active fluency in the buffet.
16 students are stuffed around pans, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a sort of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: To hire students with the most talent of universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try to attract exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
Explain to the enthusiastic young talents the training programs and the work for students and show them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: -Students come into contact with industry and gain experience -
\"In turn, VW can meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers\"
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to be advertised and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German Engineers Association (VDI) for its German acronyms, there were 40,000 vacant engineers in October.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern cane type, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
\"With the race we want to highlight the mass\"
\"The simple path by itself was left short.\"
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
\"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants\"
“Some people are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us,” she says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially, small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labor fairs.
We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs.
“Something about Intersolar” says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
“It is very complicated to fill the vacancies”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, Freiberg University.
“Teachers advise that you can practice with us or do your thesis.
No face-to-face advertising campaigns are being conducted for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
\"A large consortium normally cannot offer it,\" said Stübe, the staff member.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child care, or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds the 55th position among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff officer also expects extra points in his ranking by his aspirants to work.
“I believe that the applicant is particularly focused on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy that wins a good reputation as employers.
Tell your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
- Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors -
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
\"It's like a gang game,\" Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
No new oil drilling has appeared in these years from the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus annulled its earlier plans in an unappealed manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new perforations remain sealed for the time being.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform, Deepwater Horizon, in April.
Before the misfortune that cost 11 workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To this day it has not been fully clarified who is the responsibility of the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Minister of the Interior, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, several peteroller consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible supervisory authority, who after being charged with corruption charges, has fallen into disrepute, is reforming itself as a root.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative fiscal gaps will be closed for oil and gas consortia.
The industry publicly announces that total golf extraction will be lower due to stricter regulation, to date.
The government's plans are the greatest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries, says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO consulting company before the ban on extraction of Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: \"No one knows exactly what changes with regulation\"
Investments in new extraction projects are soon extended to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is marron oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in theft, corruption and illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
\"Don't get tired\" reassures the environmental activist to journalists: \"Today will spend enough oil in your eyes\"
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Earlier here, she took her legs in her fists, explained Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most haunted regions in the world.
On the path of the river path that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which sinks its hand into the water, will pull out a full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark rosewoods, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain, bird bands are searched, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier of the exterior is silenced, a kind of phantom calm of an earlier paradise with smell of gas.
\"What happens here is an ecological struggle,\" says Celestine Akpobari, \"We live in constant danger to health.\"
It's the war comparison.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a renegade battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers burst more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, it is forbidden to return companies to Ogoniland: As they daily pumped more than two million barrels of black gold from all over the delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms as water-sculpture extrafailures: - Christmas trees - they affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every instant a head is missing, opina Akpobari, then handles a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to the experts' evaluations, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the shore of the ship - Exxon Valdez - 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the biggest ecological catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break down and the leaked pipelines as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, reproached scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only pipeline defects indexes are - on a multiple larger than elsewhere -
In one place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears an oil-filled workshop under the open sky, figures appear from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flame a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drops and eventually leaves diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 litres of diesel barrels daily: \"It gives us 34,000 naira - about 22 dollars.
Delta inhabitants take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 Euro-centre per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from —the bunkers — who called the pipeline network through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional material stored is clearly refined illegally: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
\"If the oil tankers did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no thefts, no illegal refineries.\"
While the conditions of the ogoni are crushed mostly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: \"Perhaps it is best to present another nationality, such as the Chinese\"
Michael gets nervous.
\"It's time for you to disappear,\" says the Musculo Ölmann.
- Soldiers can come in any minute.
If the special unit of the army takes illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
\"This damned invention has completely broken our country,\" says Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce - a catastrophic failure in the engine -
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that carried out an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than one could imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted to a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated consequences: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused a catastrophic failure in the engine.
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among the Qantas-Airbus that had to carry out a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal means against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the Sydney Federal Court that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will perform more safety tests for superjumbos equipped with the engines affected.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered aircraft is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada in the whole country causes chaos in traffic
Total white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and airplanes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: In most of the country, freezing temperatures were reached on Thursday night, triggering chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow cover of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and in many streets.
In the A7 at the Flensburg height, the drains are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but not ready.
In addition, strong breezes line the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) awaits living tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems in highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major riots on the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind stopped traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snows affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees fell on the roads or the ruined chain and holes are the main problems.
The interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firemen and rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow mix the streets.
At the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a flight information center spokesperson, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights are already cancelled.
The drains are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinist suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of the snow streets: Here too a truck was hit on a track crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's tour to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after returning with her car near Aschafenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be softer and more dusty and will therefore be swirled in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to make it very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deouche Bank seeks a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution looks for buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to EUR 500 million.
Recently Deutschen Bank managed its headquarters: Twin Towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank neighborhood; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium wants in appearance to profit from the costs of the revocation, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as stated by the Financial Times Deutschland, based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not specify the reasons for the project sale.
\"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again,\" he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution is renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the renowned newspaper towers as \"Grenhowers\" in about EUR 500 million.
If the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or an independent investor has not been revealed at present, the spokesperson said.
Thousands of people mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies could not be found, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of misfortune, but it did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been able to recover to date.
Presently family members and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing brightness of the sun on Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags were half-posted in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface - from the depths of the earth - said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
\"But they never came home.\"
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
With the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures from the interior of the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police superior, to journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic - Wallalla Rising -
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when rolling - Walhalla Rising -
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip off his enemies' guts from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is called in fact, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried for as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for cinematists growing and interested in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot be ruled out mutually.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy about the drug-traffic hairstyle - Pusher - as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all public with something more humor in the main current or somewhat less of the brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and buds that sprout cannot deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the action fans die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in calm and fog before his team gets to America and shut up again there.
It is a pity that - Wallalla Rising - has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of cinema is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it is all atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is counted just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the lubrous soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, especially, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a little ruby young man, who loyally supports Unojo, preserves something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
“Walhalla Rising” is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to take an opinion on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians reportedly built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the U.S. international intelligence service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the very appropriate Kibar for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
The technique, on the other hand, hardly serves other purposes than for those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or from the interior.
It was a short time ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but he was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is barely better known than at that time, the riddles became bigger over time.
The former U.S. President, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he barely saw evidence that there was a nuclear weapons program in the country.
In Europe, a number of secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only talk about a \"supposed reactor\" - although they consider it \"pleasurable\" - the CIA's presentation.
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how certain it was to have in front of a reactor, a high diplomat from the NU responded in the summer in a stoning way that the IAEA has - enough material to have questions -
The Syrians quickly desisted themselves from the rubble of the alleged “unutilized military building” and turned the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium tracks in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors at the right time after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always made it clear that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as verosymil after analysis of particles.
Damaskus has since refused to discuss it, just as with satellite images.
In addition, controllers are forbidden a second inspection at the Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
\"We'll never comment on it.\"Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and - and is gradually transformed into a serious credibility problem for the authorities - as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious infringement against the treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons is finally pending, for which IAEA is responsible.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be (in functional connection) with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public until what teams are being dealt with, nor what functions they have, nor if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an interior once again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely to be located on or immediately next to a military base, with this reason it prohibits entry to all three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to teams thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates shore.
A high-ranking Western diplomat in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be - related to fuel production -
But there is no indication of sensitive activities, either of uranium enrichment or of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium must come from and where plutonium must subsequently be separated for pumps, for these central questions there are, in the best case, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes of the ground trucks have disappeared, no one has information about where the rubble remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its fitness as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and eliminated large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it hardly helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has employed a few months to develop an inspection plan there, that the Syrians allowed, in order to maintain the possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the Inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, has caught up with the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of - an option to which I am open in the future - but still vague.
This path is very risky: For this, the majority of the IAEA's governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought: \"And what if they find nothing at the end?\"
Love in the Times of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still without name.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, and at the last moment they moved a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hassecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie, and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, women offered him a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hassecic.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position in this regard has given victims enough on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, had recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, said the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the script, awarded after a strip and released a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she is putting much effort into the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents are still inaccurate.
In the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant - victim of rape falls in love with torturer -
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is - unjust and based on wrong information -
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon is finally again good for the Irish.
No sign of affliction
On the other hand, the home team dominates its clients from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans cry out for joy as they hold the music high, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the southerland Cork, because the players launch, and find, table tennis balls to the beers from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called \"Beerpong\" and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world's beerpong championship in January.
Cyan Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and discreet computer actually don't make good mics.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting from the fulminant question, what the future will stand for.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
\"I have a bad feeling,\" he says.
\"It's very far from home and I don't have work there yet\"
At least: Your girlfriend is waiting for you in Auckland, from one shot she got the work of her dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign, says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already looked for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in Londrés.
Young people go: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
Until 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Prognostics are confirmed, there is a migration wave comparable to the one the island suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, Melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis mainly confuses well-trained young Irish people, for whom so far it is all up.
The loss of employment and the social downturn seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: \"In Ireland everything sinks\"
\"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and thus to an entire generation\"
\"The last one closing the door\"
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future coming because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
\"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to get new jobs,\" says 20-year-old girl.
Note how your peers go from unrecognized practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
\"This idea is sad and depressing.\"
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the \"WorkingAbroadExpo\" a fair that offers a service on the subject of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career,” says the manager.
Photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada appear on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, except for freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only a few times because he works overtime so he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
\"The situation is a little crazy,\" he says, as he has been stepping on the threshold of his home a long time ago.
\"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never that good.\"
He laughs a bit embarrassed and goes for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with care gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
\"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,\" he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves hotter tea and says: \"I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch\"
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often hears today.
\"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island,\" he says.
\"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps it makes us feel for the first time as Irish.\"
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last major economic crisis went to England.
\"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple.\"
Cyan Tanner likes these ideas.
Keep the future up and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that bothers you to remain: the celebration of your 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate into a farewell party.
\"Only, not too many emotions,\" he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
\"Friendly, it sounds very distressing.\"
\"We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games\"
The democratic routine
Support for democracy continues to increase in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest survey of Latinobarometer conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been regularly conducted since 1995, it allows for follow-up on changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, held in September and early October, two related issues are highlighted.
The first is the relatively animated mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a small 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably over 25% registered in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis probably meant that many Latin American countries were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty is only marginally increased in 2009 and has been reduced again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
That feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the surveys, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent states that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% supports private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (as opposed to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by the respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Waste
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, much worse happened than foreigners were afraid of trying to help the country go back to its troubles.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were - relatively good elections in many ways -
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously stated that - we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process -
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Preval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the decommissioning will take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request to invalidate the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic ravages the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity papers, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been noted, so do Haitians themselves.
Stepping towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50 per cent, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of all this, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after the death of Kirchner due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic meetings in which one Member punched another in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
\"I'm not going to argue,\" said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to the next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it probably grows up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the trade unions' wage demands, are around 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was at the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction its priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández change these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit wage increases in the year close to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is signaling that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders that had denied a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve the supervision of the IMF, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer technical assistance to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term of office ends, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband on her side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you refuse, quietly, many of your husband's policies.
Medium hurrah for China
The voters of Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother across the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned on total independence from Taiwan, had almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidents, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections, they were able to see the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls of dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt at strict murder fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man from the crowd shot the young man right in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner in the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not being addressed.
Instead, candidates spoke of public accommodation plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT usually avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable for most Taiwanese people.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would no doubt also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing to do is to wait for the 2012 presidential election to happen.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008 openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as the PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Mrs Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for the creation of a group of experts to act as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a \"reliable alternative\" to Mr Ma's hasty approach towards China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to appear to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen intervening, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
KMT should also take a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson states that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, \"ya has crossed the point of no return\"
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and people will probably look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, made one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, Esperanza, the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the rules of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not taken to the market more than three albums before recording what - it determines the public identity of that artist -
Its ambitious album of 2010, “Chamber Music Society”, no doubt made great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, a distinction can be drawn between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones’s success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently focused on the field of jazz for this category.
In the rest of the categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity”, an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer is former saxophonist James Moody with (Moody 4B) and theologian John Beasley for (Positootly)
Trombone Shorty, a favorite writer in New Orleans and a regular guest in \"Treme\" of HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is highly inclined towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Arge's Secret Society got a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the big camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his byte, \"Pathways\" was a great example of the bass player's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by \"God Ex Machina\" by piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey with \"Dreamhouse\" a three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among those nominated with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4,-Los Angeles - a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories that span orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by \"God Ex Machina\" and \"Metropolis Symphony\" by the Symphonic Orchestra of Nashville; Steven Mackey by \"Dreamhouse\" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; \"Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati - by various artists; and the \"Requiem\" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by \"Lulu\" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by \"Marc Antonio e Cleopatra\" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by \"The Love of Loin\" of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by \"The Enchanted Wanderer\" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by \"Ivanhoe\" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The songwriters appointed to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No 4, Daugherty by “Deus Ex Machina” Hans Werner Henze by “Appasonally Plus” Magnus Lindberg by “Graffiti” and Shchedrin by “The Enchanted Wanderer”
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was released at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Ángeles Philharmonic, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, of about 30 minutes, is nicknamed \"Los Angeles\" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The “Mandolin Concerto” by Dorman is appointed by the soloist performance instrumental with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it in Mandolina Avital, who played the concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“It was composed of sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed to the position of orchestra by directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
The nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominations as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of \"Roots - My Life, My Song\"
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of order
The Temecula Mosque Project has obtained the unanimous support of the local ordination commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it fosters terrorism and the attacks.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
\"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahais, of all religions,\" said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
\"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of it.\"
“Promising the prevalence of justice”
\"The opposition is really minimal,\" he adds.
\"Only they speak very loudly.\"
\"In this valley there are wonderful people\"
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded in favour or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
\"United States no longer exists\" is read in one of the comments.
\"This is another planet of the apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the arena\"
\"America has fallen.\"
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, the Imam Mahmoud Harmush has reported acts of violence.
Its congregation of about 135 families has been living together for years in Riverside County, but it wanted a greater and better space than the warehouse that rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a surface of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the Municipal Council.
A arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
“This body has a dual capacity”
\"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic\"
\"That makes it very peculiar, although little is missing to be a really 'alienian' way of life,\" said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the publication Science.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of elements - standard - which we consider essential for life may not be so fixed - said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
\"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,\" Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's astrobiology institute, which led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one by another.
‘Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus’
\"Consequently, it can be difficult for different organisms to make them different.\"
“However, arsenic is different enough so that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to say the least, appeals to biochemical machinery,” explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it may naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but no example has ever been found to prove it works.
The arsenic was more common in the early eras of the earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life might have used it.
“Yes, it suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” Foster said, not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs have been found missing in Compton
The two missing dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower motel, said sheriff of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as the authorities pointed out.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday, late at night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff's department of Los Angeles County.
“The good news is that dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
\"They're in good condition.\"
\"They have returned with their legitimate owners\"
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
\"An investigation is being carried out\"
\"We don't want to say anything,\" Whitmore said.
- We're following a few tracks.
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area's competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other scheduled competitions for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour of almost two months that the couple is participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer's baby, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be fresher.
They left the window slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether or not a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to begin again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to wipe out approximately $5 billion of debt, leading the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
The judgment of Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to resume under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributed $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when the Moelis and Co. Investment Bank was hired to provide advice on the management necessary to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and business recovery expert in bankruptcy, known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $3755,000 a month for their company administration services, will receive some $4 million of successful fees.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and gathered an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on \"The Hobbit\" along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your gift budget balanced
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant honey in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with beads, or approximately 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys-R — Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less than last year's.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known such, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-driven toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys-R- Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys the size of a guinea pig singing a note when their barrels are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to set a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts to squeeze, it cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-over games like Simóm Dice, and can do the lunar step, thanks to its innovative legs articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of questions letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an eventful self-correction exercise book.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important development of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, aged 3-7 years) uses a iTunes type system to present games and ebooks, and has a SD card slot that allows viewing of family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a five-block game just bigger than a zip box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to set up words by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
It is increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your son an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 - Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle mascot toy.
A little bigger than your toothbrush pig, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and above) is the last in a line of button-driven microrobots.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to do a block maze to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is being promoted in China
As an urban sergeant instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their vigorous measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
\"Friends\"
-Be careful.
Show them, whispered, - how pretty girls are -
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the tied hair with blue and white striped wheels.
\"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,\" said Mr. Tang, demeaningly.
-The models are beautiful.
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of the city inspectors in China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers encircled a tiny basket of snacks, and watched him constantly with the swan rustling for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's humble respect for these squadrons of the city.
And for good reason, they would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of Hubei Province struck down a passerby after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively striking criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a street vendor from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents Chinese trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Cengguan has left a scar in the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The diary demanded a truly meticulous cleaning.
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district had requested eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for women from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure - and the five harmonious facial features -
They were supposed to have a height above the average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
‘First, the external qualities of the candidates shall determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.’
Then comes the temperament - and the inner qualities -
The female chengguans are like florets, he said, and he added, \"Besides being florets, they will have other responsibilities\"
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But it noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disabled or disfigured must not appear.
\"We can't let a person get caught or a jogger come to work here,\" said Mr. Zheng.
\"Your image wouldn't be good.\"
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguan Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks sexist, she said.
\"You think I look sexy in this uniform,\" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old Xu Yang working partner said, \"Our work must present the city's image.\"
They do not oppose their work on a given time, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply abstaining vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces more or less a dozen street vendors who launch on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many pans or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
\"Lord Wang, you have to leave\"
“We’ve told her many times,” said Miss Xu as a salesman walked away, temporarily abandoning her bicycle-drawn car with noodles.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is about the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free time.
‘Very routine —
One reason is that female officials lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the vendors' merchandise.
They can only threaten to denounce the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were mutiny after the false rumor spread that a Chengguan officer had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were shot or fired.
Xindu has for the time being avoided such violence.
But calmness is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the quiet Plaza Baoguang, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation was stagnant for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, aged 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
\"Sometimes we fight verbally\"
“Sometimes we struggle physically,” Mr. Li said with complete naturalness.
\"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight\"
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Ensign faces, the Republican of Nevada who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said that it felt — surely happy — for the decision, that it came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Department of Justice had informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this issue.
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents released first in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's behalf with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on behalf of them after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the tradeoff, appeared in disagreement with the so-called \"revolting door lobbying ban\" which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, \"it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving status door,\" said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending government-researched clients.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several important setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to leave the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors - they are clearly cowards - said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Justice Department on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to charge his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, - acted in accordance with the law -
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
\"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,\" he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of cabinet, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was \"mocking\" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Alligiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned to his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists two weeks ago that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
“The Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them — chatting — in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes a minute, they sent reports of the terrible testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have submitted writings in court outlining the arguments of appeals that will probably occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created - a circus atmosphere - and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appeal judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
\"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial,\" said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of Mr. Hayes' defense.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were - carefully controlled - and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic ruling of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was - an atmosphere of carnival in the process - due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film - The fugitive -
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
\"There is a general concern about the impact of new media on high profile processes,\" said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during the selection of the jury.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and his daughters, Hayley, 17th and 11th Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will hold that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict because of his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually cast firewood on the case.
\"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court,\" the lawyers wrote, \"it was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.\"
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports given more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court's policy on the control of coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often felt attracted to the arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
\"This case - they wrote, \"represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century -
Can civicism tend a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for inventiveness and negativity, a bit of civicism has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a portent of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by what everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion of the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's committee of deficits was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, examining each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether these are taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
\"They're inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good.
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to extend unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After the Tuesday meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outstanding session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisanism when the new 112th. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
\"After the things that must be done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation,\" he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the 2012 major event,” he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As Republican leaders are more aware of the dangers of overemphasizing their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their pledges of cutting state expenses and nullifying the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes and retirement age, and the cut in expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to reach close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the staff members chosen in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or desires for commitment in fiscal matters at the present time.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who considers that he is losing will likely change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
partisanism and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, civilization this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on the issues that still divide them.
A filtered US document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a \"cleptocracy\" and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that directly brings to the Kremlin, as reported by the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each branch of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the \"vertical authority\" takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday by WikiLeaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have consistently denied the charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits on such charges.
In September, when he was asked about a documentary on a Russian television channel that suggested it was corrupt, he said: \"It's crazy, a paternity, a nuisance.\"
According to the surveys, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is unheard that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more like a cleptocracy than a government, states the note.
The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means \"toll\" or protection) that passes the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world.
\"Luzhkov is at the highest\"
\"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level\"
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level”
\"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services\"
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, \"explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.\"
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority”
The note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about the fight against corruption, but he has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
\"But he's a part of this bureaucracy.\"
\"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia\"
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he affirmed, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked at post 154 (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not happen until late in Moscow's hour night, will certainly cause dismay within the Russian government, and despite the fact that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that said U.S. diplomats called it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
\"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,\" he said.
\"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way\"
The veterans of the Red Gemers forced to face the past
In a concrete, weakly lit classroom, with spotless walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Gemers.
\"Here everyone loves Ta Mok\"
“He was a good leader and worried about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as the \"Carnicero\" because of its brutality during the government of the Red Gemers, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Gemers in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Gemers surrender to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time taught the story of the Red Gemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Gemers, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, best known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Gemers of Anlong Veng, compounding efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Gemers, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
\"To them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.\"
“This is generating divisions within families”
During the administration of the Red Gemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or excess work.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that was surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its bases in the mountains and forests of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemers fighters began deserting the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Gemers fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemers elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for depositing their weapons, the soldiers were still poor and unskilled farmers.
\"These people have gained few benefits after surrender,\" said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Centre, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
\"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime\"
“They were created without any concept to do business”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Gemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
\"Life with the Red Gemers was good,\" he said.
\"Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone\"
\"But now life is difficult because we have to supply ourselves\"
The current Court of the Red Gemers has also caused concern here.
In early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecution of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Gemers.
The court ' s mandate is to prosecute the leading leaders and those of greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This is not much used to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Red Jemers government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent noisy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden balls on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the reed grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Gems.
She claimed that if the court had called her, she would not be presented.
\"Cambodia is at peace and stable,\" he said.
\"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war\"
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Red Gemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
\"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,\" he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces,” he said.
\"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand\"
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Gemers, called \"A History of Democratic Kampuchea\" of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Gemers.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Gemers, despite the city's bond with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skepticically when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
\"They have suspicions because they are unsure about the number of people the court will process\"
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, this is where the Red Jemers keep a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by an oxidized roof of leafy.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
31-year-old Nuom Sothea, a mobile salesman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
\"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him,\" he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in hopes of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to waive its qualified uranium reserve for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out classified with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for armament of a Belarusian investigation facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
\"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.\"
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is - a very significant and important step - given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
\"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-qualified uranium) and low-enrichment uranium,\" said Lukashenko at the time.
\"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone\"
- We use it for research purposes, that's all -
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
The officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence, which led to Clinton's agreement.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium rated for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reservation towards 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential extension.
It was stated that while progress on these global security issues was welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the country's progress and its citizens.
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then Prime Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to - be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain -
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, were held between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report - had taken the Zapatero Government out of play - and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
“From Vega he stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory”
\"They simply want to be informed\" to avoid being \"pulled off,\" says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then Foreign incumbent, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive - wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, when in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence -
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating element or any sensitive information,” the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
\"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,\" laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that, even though the Spanish judges are scrupulously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate, he had instructed his collaborators - to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature -
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
\"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government,\" he says.
The parish priest confessed that he was complaining in the network of the \"agobio\" of being a mother.
The young woman spoke about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: \"Terror to the Galician\"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is \"Muki\" on the network.
With this supernomial, which he uses from a young age, he communicates with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natures of Noia, the kruñese people of which she is from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, that ABC rebuilds through testimonies from his relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, soon she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
He soon met another boyfriend.
The elected one was Alberto, a boy from Louuseme, a neighbouring municipality.
With him he came to live for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it turns out that his romance broke, which broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: \"Alberto is very rare and musked, because I have come to work\"
\"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it is to be with the child all day long and not be free to do what he wants.\"
Then talk about a message to the phone you just received: \"I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child\"
She complains: \"If you don't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll pick him up when I come back,\" she says.
In May, he speaks of the return to his people: \"This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so as not to lose it.\"
Make it clear that if everything goes well, it leads to its firstborn.
\"He'll be with whom he owes, that is, with me, and I'll never happen to leave him again with anyone other than my mother - a dubious intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on the 10th, is dead.
\"César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other.\"
\"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day\"
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
\"He'll go there (the boy) to some summer classes, and so I save myself some kangaroo pasta\"
Seventeen, memories and complaints.
\"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come\"
\"Tells Alberto that he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, watch how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck up\"
30, another: \"The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan\"
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: \"He takes my money away\"
On the internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to the anime and the manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe MySpace, now intervened, where he was called \"Muki the excarcator.\"
‘Galgae terror (epigraphs)’.
The last man who lived with her, sworn guard, declares his grief for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detainees in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, - nor did he intend to cause any harm to the minor -
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the CSP would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen the generals as, whether or not it has advanced, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this formation receives in those elections usually doubles what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomics of 2006, the figure amounted to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a shift in the votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate date will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its relief to the front of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Nationalist and popular alike agree on the possibility that the CSP will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or be able to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unravelled that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelones Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can lead the return to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP was only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell, which, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including the Tamil Land Liberation Tigers (LTTE) and the latter author of the Bombay bombings, which killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the \"Kampai operation\" it has been - weakened - al Qaeda's international falsification apparatus and, therefore, its operational capacity -
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that are part of the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their combatants can cross the European borders and other western countries with total impunity.
The disassembled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network has operated in Europe, so that investigations have participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory they are carried out in the next days similar blows to that developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested, another was developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Ahar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called \"World Islamic Front\"
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of boys between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found that binds those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, \"Laskar and Taiba\" has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about $1,000 that were -inverted - in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the -command - that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that they are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without phylo-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he obtained 18 Members in last Sunday's elections, more than enough to make himself want, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks that these days hold Mas with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as far as the PP president is concerned, to support an investment - it will have to park all sovereignist and independentist speeches - as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to speed up the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
Details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to \"lack of measures\"
The owners of the center of Olot don't rule out their celebrator to kill more than 11 elders
The managers of the geriatric La Charitat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press wheel to highlight the damage that has caused the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elders he was in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel from the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that, \"the desire of La Charitat would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible for the deaths, but - the legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials -
And it is that in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the celebrator, the great threat to La Charitat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the families of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then it has not stopped killing.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor had personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was off the phone.
The Charitat, through her director, flatly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that - the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what has happened -
La Charitat's lawyer added that, in the case, there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by any other person other than the accused himself.
He had already been baptized as \"Angel de la Muerte\" and had confessed 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 to, one and a half months later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Charitat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
Insulin drops and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to give them death.
But it will be the analysis that is being carried out in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she embraced them inside by giving them law as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Charitat, they don't give credibility to the showman's demonstrations, not even to the number of confessed murders, that they don't rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that he has given Vila on his visits to the judge and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat warning - markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity -
The peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the actions of the European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake, and the euro has hardly reassessed what is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is that of an illegal market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and to eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended - at least until March - and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, that God assists us!
As at their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to achieve parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has insufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and powerful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a bonus to three years that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
To Spain asking for a Plan of Help would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, to very expensive types and closes your access to sine markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, - in addition to being, it seems -
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's board requested by her children
The temporal does not spring up in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, in considering it, in full right, the judicial board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and take action with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodega Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and Maria José are adjusting the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute by the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors was disbanded by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantil Registry.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantil No. 2 in Madrid, has reopened the trust box within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is characterized by David Álvarez as a “desperate recourse of the applicants to, by means of procedural argument, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of the law, try to validate and heal the radically null board of January 18” according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the appeal, once the board has been held, to be held as a full-fledged member of the Board.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the judge to convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, heritage society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the benefit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the substantive issue which the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which no date has yet been specified.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software design improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the rising trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all gambled for the triumph of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without demerging the skill as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the \"secret weapon\" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing plant assembly chains around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to play, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous commercial cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry to effect - in a few hours, almost real time - the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the shields in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team, 180 young highly qualified professionals are working today, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzing and projecting all sorts of changes in the bolids.
Siemens Director explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull Bolides with the exception of the engine, which is Renault's full responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through laser and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development is the $40 million amount that each Formula 1 team can spend as much every season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolids in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered - high secret -
The staffing for this task is 580 people, including their two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and its notoriety null.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago, it could be said that the advances of R & D in carriage cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science as - they are unpredictable gladiators -
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration is its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president, Helena Herrero, put as an example the remodeled store located in the Gran Vía Barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The U.S. group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand selling points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third being Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HP Personal Systems Director also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with expertise and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive trading network aims to - improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging -
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the potential problems of HP computers in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
\"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days\"
“This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies have already hired technical assistance services,” Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'robar' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and emptys the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be attempted to offset in part by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million particular customers, his subject matter pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have a three-year term.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to use FROB's public aid, is to win market share with the capture of one million new private customers -700,000 if they discount those who can leave the bank - their large outstanding subject, since so far it had spoiled more SMEs and businesses than the retail customer.
This year it has taken 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in private is 3.5%, while in companies it is above 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity stake, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and the challenges of which will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now daring to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell will, in fact, close his four-year plan, which was set for four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation made it a further exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year - difficult and transcendental -
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain - will be slow -
In addition, in two or three years it will be - very difficult to create employment - something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit”
\"We haven't closed the grip, but the differentials are higher,\" said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see FiveDays of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend of banking now - it is to raise commissions - but - there is a competitive framework -
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain - bigger sizes are going to be required -
\"The coming year is going to move everything,\" he said.
It asserts that capital needs are -above a lot - and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supply the market in the collection of funds for new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of the markets, it became important for some bankers to become vatician already as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to take place.
\"I think the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank Group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments\"
“Most of it is completely done; we may instead of 17 go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which in that has collaborated very much too,” said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is affecting - as fast as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place in the deadlines that, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España - emphasized.
“Rating from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion volume of assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities to 62% so that they are much larger to meet Basel,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that - there are a number of rather unlucky views on the slowness of the process - which demonstrate - a lack of seriousness and sense - because - what the Banco de España does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year -
The ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and, probably, in the world, and attributed to those who put it to trial a \"lack of knowledge\"
The director noted that, within the current economic situation, - we can be very calm - with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration - very important - and that - goes as fast as possible -
It also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies to place or remove the EUR 426 of aid to unemployed people without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should those movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new view of what its future must be, which is shocking to maintain the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, consisting of itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favourable trend of opinion, is close to 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals of sisters of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressors, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government took a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour plans and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel greatly extended Greece's rescue decision.
He was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published it were very opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel again emerged with a clear position, demanding reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to save a country and at the same time force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of reform of the Union to enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not plan to cross.
And it is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not very much agree, the former operation of the euro will be over from that date.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as that which has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will move towards greater peace.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifest (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we need to put order at home has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't seem to be moving it.
And, among the possibilities that are envisaged, to leave a monetary zone too crowded from unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
So, Germany will always be able to tell us that you have already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Traits such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but do not want to escape a punishment.
The alleged expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party played on 23 November against the Ajax in the League of Champions has led to the writing of ink rivers about whether or not such behavior is unsporting and whether, eventually, both players were to be sanctioned by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when taking out missing paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next league party, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned two parties to the team coach, José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been led by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem presumed to be noble and honor, and that in past times it has fined its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of hysteronic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if these actions are committed fraud of the law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but they seem to evade its meaning.
The issue is about examining the kind of damage that the sports spirit causes.
One of the goods that comprises the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was not put at risk, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another one of these goods that is alluded to with the clean game is to prevent the team of violators from improperly taking advantage of the opposite team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we usually characterize as a trap or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the punishment, but that precisely its action tried to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain in the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it does not place itself in a disadvantageous position to the rival nor is it beneficial in the same party, for evidently the result of the action implies leaving the team with fewer players.
And it's also also a useful strategy for the next match, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated at the first exchange, and in addition with this performance the players fulfill a sanction match and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that help to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the assumption that we are concerned, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was two self-expulsion and by the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive offers to catch Christmas group dinners in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
They proliferate the celebrations self-suffered by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turret and the lottery, with the arrival of December, they also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have resulted in a price offensive adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the employers and associations of the sector interviewed coincide.
To finish complicated accounting, this year's calendar (at the fall of the Night on Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of December 13th, with the result to the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and just movement for the previous week.
As it has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners on a budgetary issue.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own pocket.
Whatever the circumstances, some and others demand battle prices, it confirms the president of the Gremi de Restoració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farras.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to vacillate what this month's festivities will be like.
- People think about it a lot before they book it.
“He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he points out.
The business is going to be fine - those who give quality at good price and with good service - add, and remember that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey at various central establishments there is a collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a genuine boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early reservation, even since early November.
“We have done everything impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros,” they say.
In AN Group, which will abandon El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in billing from the second semester and some good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate parties.
To its six group menus they have added a little Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, such as cava.
They also see green sprouts in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat greater.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), his vice president, Henry Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that together the reserves are - animated - even though the customers - negotiate at most -
That's right, the illusion of parties hasn't come down, pay the payer, it says.
Pakistan’s nuclear programme creates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a faster rate than any other country.
Wikileaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and juicy details on the content of the talks and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, -decreases - and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons - at a faster pace than any other country in the world -
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but that they remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: \"The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials\"
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and motive for keeping guard.
\"Pakistan has had to recruit personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes,\" said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An office of the embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as \"professor\", says: \"Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid are left unanswered or discarded\"
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that — despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world —
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it very clear to the head that the Pakistan Army must end the tacit support of terrorist groups.
Hunting Wikileaks' Chief
Obama appoints a high-ranking anti-terrorist fight leader to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a \"red alert\" to - localize and follow the movements - of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Furthermore, it is not new, but dates from 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, says the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after being authorized by the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange - with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition -
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed to an arrest - which must call the national police corps -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer by videoconferencing the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, to which they compared with the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
\"This seems like a hunt, not a legal pursuit,\" the missive denounces.
As the world looks for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
On Monday he granted an interview from an indefinite location to Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
\"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign,\" he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as \"ridical and absurd.\"
\"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website,\" he said to the CNN chain.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations - to intervene and their funds and to prosecute anyone who gave them any contribution or assistance -
Further away, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to retreat after saying that Assange should - be killed -
‘Obama should become objective and use an unmanned plane or something’
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
\"Anyone in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,\" said Fox chain.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with foxes to the affines to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the same internal revolt in the rows of ERC, with no north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his homelessness is insufficient for the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as diluted today as his own mentor and that it can at all cause the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the left-wing leader will try to win new critics with foxes that will allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to comment on their continuity in secret.
Through paperboards, and not by hand.
If the carrodists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half more than one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result - to the Bulgarian -
The next to Carod demand something more than making the president available to militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But by not having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will put to the vote of the national council on 18.
His intention is to appraise Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something already given by the dome.
The ERC leader acknowledged that the \"poliphony\" damages stability and that its objective is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing the dirty rags of doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article that the active advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of innovation has given the fact that the leader will be refreshed - in exchange for various objectives -
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first - to recompose - the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC at once liquidize as an operating mechanism.
It thus proposes a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsive of 2008 left the responsibility for the direction to review assembly at a specific congress of statute reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged the issue.
Now, without sectors critical to the shelter, it can be a good time to resume it and try to shut it down forever.

According to the MILENIO County State of Mexico, a decrease of four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the container of MILENIO State of Mexico.

Keeps China's objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, said Su Wei, representative of that country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), its Wei ensured that its country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he stated, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not modify its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He referred to the Chinese climate strategy as being divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all of these sections, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the state and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it abounded, are in progress or have already concluded several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent focus by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, is also underway.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, exposed, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the last five years and planning to do so by the year 2020, has increased.
Paste the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is appropriate.
NAP national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was tied to legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate for his right.
In an interview before the protest taken by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission.
Mr Espino has the right, if any, to appeal to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body, he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that a presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was said to be convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which he will have to choose his successor.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so - it doesn't scare us into internal competition; the accountant - we enjoy it and strengthen us - said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, so he will hand over the scam to whom the council determines.
\"I have that absolute peace and openness, any one of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office.\"
He predicted that the repunte he recorded the party in the past elections on 4 July will be reflected in the upcoming contests, though - it is not time to think about 2012 -
\"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.\"
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, hence that - many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations -
When questioned about PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the prisoners to reflect on the genders of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
\"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they leave the clout,\" he said.
He felt that the federal executive could make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditory, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promoeve Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
\"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and let them pass the legislation,\" tweeted the American president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and press them to pass the legislation,” Obama tweeted.
Its brief message keeps a cyber link open with a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
\"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,\" he points out.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
\"I think there's a long time.\"
We all agree that we have to solve the tax case by the end of the year.
\"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,\" he said.
The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a \"vote to close debate\" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or U.S. Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when project-sponsored organizations play an intense role in ensuring the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act need to join several Republicans in the event that other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have declared that they will not support it at any other time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the league
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants made the gala of the narration
“That of Sex in the Language I understand it but...the finger in the lagoon? what is expected of me,” asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table devoted itself to Sex in the Language, he explained).
The finger in the lagoon... - puts us in apricots - sweetly spelt the Argentine writer to the audience, mostly young, who was quoted at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he devoted to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would then define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what is the - league - goes from doctor to doctor, from which he does not get answers even if clues in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectologist, he is convinced: “Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my league.”
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies him that he calls is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: -the flame is the real open, the symbolic is the scar -
The protagonist sighed and concluded - from the laga I only realized that it is the real open and that it does not exist - but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very much.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with them both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narrative entitled Elogio de la invention, where the finger in the lagoon is not named but in a moment it is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, he tells of a famous spell, which was the same playing clouds, he brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that would have lost a maiden, story that turned to speak later America, the great novel to which he did not miss from the beginning his own chroniclers who had told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
\"Certains who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America never had been told with imagination to which it was missing until the foul.\"
However, he pointed out - the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine - and that is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where the fiction literature reaches its apogeum.
It's actually called the \"cervantine tradition.\"
“By your inheritance we are what matters”
In turn, writer Mayra Montero approached and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the lagoon.
The Cuban-Poertorrique pointed its way to the great scourge of social violence across its country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
\"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated,\" he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that in a \"chemical reaction\" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose intervention also emphasized that finger in the lague of the writer’s committed writer.
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting - that behind each claim there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes -
\"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of reality we have to jinx it means often to put our finger on the pond and to annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to annoy the powers that prefer a black and white world,\" he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had heights in his career, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had heights in his career, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentine has ended up comfortingly with the medal of the sub champion, there has been a step behind the winners and curiously with one team has played consecutive ends.
The holy strategist arrived at its first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he was carrying the reins of Morelia with which he fell globally of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 clossure he also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again in front of the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 in front of the mourners after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he put himself in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for three of his players finally failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 spin.
Rubén has already lost two endings with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he states that for him the most important is the institution.
\"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby I owe myself to and therefore will come the title for me, but the above is the most important thing,\" commented the helm when questioned about the numbers against playing finals.
Very effective has the previous ending, of which, he assures, he has learned a lot, - the only teaching we can have is that until the referee silences the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the time before, with two criminals for throwing we were already ready to run and I think that this is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate -
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts your players: \"One never seeks to get to the crime scene, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there's no other one and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made a bad move to fate, sometimes by nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but if we left, that left us something for this end that we hope not to get to that instance -
Roman has in his hands to stop being a junior coach and prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to get visas
People should visit Visa Request Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 he will change the procedure of processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will be required to visit Visa Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment to have the courier service deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for trader and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest CSA where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Likewise, those requesting visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101101_Visas-FAQs.html.
NASA will announce extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. space agency called on the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented on a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 hours at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present - a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life - which sparked speculations by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake at Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that - if there is another form of life, a second way of life, different from what we know -
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will involve geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Counterblock Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when in Congress there was an opposing bloc, headed by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, PRD; and Patrono Montalvo, 'trona' against reforming the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with bipartisanism, because now there will be two people, equal numbers of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these reforms in an institutional way constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the next few days they will speak with the representatives of the NAP and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not, then they will be bullied again by both parties and the opposing coalition ended.
This is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patronus, there are coincidences and therefore are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that Congress after it has been monopolic, now it is (duopolic)
\"It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress\"
For starters, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are chatting with other partners and partners to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'botín' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
\"Before it was just a party, now they're dividing it between two\"
Patrono Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
\"That not by doubling agreements, we've decided to put out 5 that we're probably going to do 9 Members, save the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we've decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that's the theme that in the reform they made them agreed, we're out and we're not in agreement with that reform.\"
200 thousand more go out to the supplier.
Pay Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipality’s transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of “liquidating accounts to be paid” .
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had come forward that would come out more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and therefore how many checks are missing because they are issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
\"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what is due, like the rest of the suppliers,\" he said in an interview.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as marked by the Act when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other Governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 of July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites urgent
Tourist entrepreneurs regret foreign tourist crash due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a collapse of the Sanchez Taboada Glorieta, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of fate is being taken care of and reverses the evil encountered by tourists with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the disorder and turn it around to the nearby businesses.
- Politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or otherwise they don't do the works in this way for so long and without proper planning.
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
\"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so because by giving preventive maintenance and not falling only in the corrective direction,\" he said.
\"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not just because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the Town Hall must change its strategy to keep the city well\"
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Vendito of Mazatlán.
\"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,\" he said.
\"There has been no due attention and this kind of fact shows something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed\"
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that rescue from tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city daily, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put in line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination.
Ask Congress for IP results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A legislation of work worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa facing major problems.
Since yesterday the 60 legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI, 13 NAP Members, three New Alliance Party, two PRD, one PT, one Convergence and one more PVEM, has been installed, bringing together a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that clean and committed management should be carried out with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and do not repeat the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly formed 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become the carnival appearances of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions.
That is why he spoke of securing the commitment to establish the necessary bridges leading up to the Ruler in turn.
\"We are working to do decent work and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the signposts who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections\"
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in pursuit of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in some way will encourage job creation.
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight that he carries within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
\"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agro industry\"
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing state security and updating to the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a wizard king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a nail.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colony Salvador Allende and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
\"Then sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have any chamba, but we sell mandarin and pope...I'm going out with the \"plebes\" to sell on the street\" said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana suggests cutting clothes for a year.
\"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said, 'Let's see son', because he was very expensive - he remembered with Cayetana sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
11-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; 10-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a pair of five and a half or six sizes would be of great help.
If you want to help make reality the dream of children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign Seeking a Wizard King, giving a toy or effective at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the context of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
\"They have seized about 750 plants in Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production,\" says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for security in Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear in Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of his arrest.
They could face charges of Cannabis production, possession with the object of trafficking, plot and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
\"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests,\" Mr. Ruel said.
In this police operation, around seventy officers participated in the Quebec Security Estrie Research Module, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphremagog Police Department.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the pateras charged with illegal migrants, will likely face a major opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I rely primarily on the Charter”
\"I find myself here with a party that created the granite that you pelted,\" said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its present form, which would allow any person who comes from a vessel identified as a transport of illegal immigrants to be arrested for up to one year, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he points to the wrong target.
\"We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,\" Mr. Duceppe said.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that its party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of illegal landowners, and that is what we want with another bill, C-35,” says Mrs Chow.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,” Mrs Chow explains.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
\"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a felony.\"
\"They hope that Canada will take firm action,\" said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to ask for a vote to be held so that each Member who is going to oppose is later explained to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Research has been in question since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of Tuesday has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critics of the Quebec party dealing with the question of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad as a rabbit pulled out of the sparkle, and as a last-minute solution of the bat.
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
“You will see the results when we announce it” simply indicates.
\"We are aware of this problem.\"
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
The more Mr Charest resists to avoid the creation of this research commission, the more people share our opinion, i.e., that he has something to hide, he explains.
“The only way to have a research commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this point, he suggests to Quebec that he give a special mandate to the intervener general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
\"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general speaker,\" he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrille is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the spring 2001 operation related to motor groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on Gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions had heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
They are also expected to be between 20 and 40 extra millimeters from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls add to the snow spill that has already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the civil security unit in Quebec issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to be sunk in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as stated by Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly Culpan in Dupont
The radio presenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as their coarse language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained - inaccurate information on social assistance, an improperly negative representation of Haitians and coarse language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day -
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints regarding comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable and not misleading data.
In relation to suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life problems.
The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes interrogated by - Dupont - have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner -
Therefore, any guilt has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
CHOI's presenter stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of Haitians.
\"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there.\"
\"My file has been clean for a year and a half now,\" said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated - even more than required -
The consequences shall be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of greater hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in -sanda - (kung-fu -full contact -, kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
\"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America\"
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box,” he explained.
\"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San shou in China\"
\"They will invite sportsmen who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category.\"
- In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto -
\"In 2005, in Vietnam, finished in eighth place\"
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
The interesting thing is, I've been making progress in every competition.
\"At this step, I will be the first this time or next year\"
The -san shou - or -sanda - is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to strike with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt go to the great tournament -King of Sanda - the kung-fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is China’s most famous and prestigious” explains the nice boy.
It is like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
“It has been an incredible experience”
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
\"The one who won me is a real professional,\" he says.
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg) -
-The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category -
\"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu\"
450 million contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a bid prior to the most important contract, the project management consortium, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, known as Énergie Gerance, was established in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Party of Quebec, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke rising prices.
This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition.
\"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly,\" said Sylvain Simard in a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how he could benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
\"I start to tire myself out,\" he protested, arguing that the QP had acted in a way - dishonestly - and - with a lack of rigour -
He pointed out that, at least, it would be that the QP apologized.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formula of the consortia has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was published last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the field of technical advice is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register allows more than 200 consortia to be identified, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, such as CIMA+, Genevar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that, since the 1970s, the territory of the James Bay has responded to a particular work force dynamic and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it.
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that it has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
\"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher\"
\"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price\"
\"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people,\" said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship Agreement of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are \"good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec\"
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the QP is also linked to these companies, which finance it, before it is specified that they are more than their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The green label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
Consumers in Quebec hardly trust sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even impedes their commitment.
Even if the consumption of the so-called, socially responsible products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are (ecorresponsible) says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful nature of the information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also claim to be suspicious of the alleged yields of ecological products or services being sold to them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the King's post of recycling that attempts to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness appears to be from outside doors (of your car): in 2010, only 28 per cent of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging behavioural survey, which has just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested financial commitment to the recovery of the complex of cinemas eXcentris by the Angus Society and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallèle, who were expecting a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to rebuy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to involve itself in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would in fact be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been reviewed downwards.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, referred a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent her a final report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of Cinema House Owners and Film Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector claim considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of copyright cinema in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent film rooms was evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalty to his clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open their way to acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on the next 27 February, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois -Des hommes et des dieux -
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is raised full...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian electors do not think about Canada-United States relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal electoral campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States does not fall into the issues debated by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
\"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority virtually inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),\" he writes.
It concludes, therefore, that the United States is - the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about -
The ambassador has even more difficulty in understanding this - deafening silence - because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
\"Surely, I think, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more so, of the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about when voting\"
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
\"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will first record deficits in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million,\" writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcast the dramatic series broadcast in the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the \"No-Fly-List\" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that he depended — on each case —
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, \"It has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin\"
‘The Secretariat agreed to review the file —
Finally, we can mention that the moods have been heated in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be - killed -
Mike Huckabee echoes in the United States.
A Global Plan to Refresh Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a quantity that is almost one third of the additional decrease to stabilize the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, are replaced by fluocompactic bulbs or, even better, by bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED) in English, it would avoid much of the 1,8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary motor vehicle park.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 gt of that amount should still be reduced to stabilize by 2020 the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about fluocompactic bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is poured out with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of electoral results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines for the elections have expired.
The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately, highlighting a spokesperson for the UN leader.
\"Ask all the parties of Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced\"
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since the Sunday ballot.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CIS president had commented on the television that the commission was still working to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the requests that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has the constitutional council's annulment of the votes - fraudulent - in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new Forces (NF) since the coup d'état failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has stated that the intimidation of the voters carried out by the FNs in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who disintegrates any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential round, on Sunday, was to have put the lead in the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years ago.
The United Nations has warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in mainland territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (VECs) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, be available within two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new rise in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed in the ILO sense.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4 per cent in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, within the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public goods, cover, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, as indicated by his lawyer.
\"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all questions posed to him by the magistrate, not ghosts.\"
\"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, but it's another thing to show them,\" said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client showed up.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain itself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and imprisoned one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he needs to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, says counsel Simon.
In the context of this dossier, it has also been under investigation since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has left it on parole and has prohibited meeting with the protagonists of the case.
\"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him\"
“The examining magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has released him,” Mr. Yann Arnoux explained.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of \"trafficking of influences and passive corruption\"
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for -reduction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service - and for -complicity in the misappropriation of public funds - respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by -covering the abuse of social property -
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whitewash the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A close source of research indicates that research focuses particularly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Subject: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for \"spiongage\" has had the public in France viciously, warned diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful look of the diplomats of the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “rehens” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought U.S. justice for the trafficking of materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title - Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases -
Elisha's strategic affairs adviser François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held in force in Iran.
\"Making noise,\" they say, \"to be continuously dissolved,\" in the media, the words \"basic human rights\" -- \"innocence\" -- immediate release.
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
\"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more frequently\"
Because, once the attempts to negotiate by discrete channels are exhausted, - silence will solve nothing - the Iranians are - experts in dilatory maneuvers -
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail.
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he will take refuge at the French embassy) - will require the Iranians to pay a great deal of money - €230,000 in reward).
In addition, he notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that is going to increase.
Iranians could — in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran — say.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's eviction is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free Iranians in exchange for French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that it was not so.
Elisha, he says, not only has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision, but he has tried to oppose it.
\"There has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice\" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but - the French Government cannot cancel the decision - judicial, he comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the strict supervision of French information services.
Elisha's counselor marks a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran - is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy -
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisha uses communications and - escapes - organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a role - important - and - influential - of - a mediator -
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions the media 'blitz' of French officials -
What is the result of such a welcome to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is being asked.
\"Despite their praise-filled statements, the French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done\"
The document then deals with the reasons that led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort - it aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria - opines.
A policy initiated in 2008 that, in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been distorted by the premature and undeserving nature of the situation,
By ‘exaggrating the Syrian role — Paris tries — to show Syria the praises it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region —
The goal is also to - sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran -
The U.S. embassy knows it from good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: \"Of course we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not.\"
\"But anyway, if we have thanked him\"
At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elisha.
In a statement, thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius who have played an active \"paper for the release of our compatriot\"
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The Government of South Korea is going to adopt a law called Cinderella, which will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after the middle night blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
\"Many children play all night, and then they find it difficult to study at school and live a normal life during the day.\"
\"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,\" said AFP Jo Rin, a ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6:00 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precisely.
The government is also asking companies to limit daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the responsible.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests it for free software that allows to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most (connected) countries and newspapers regularly provide news of various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where struggles of influence and lobbying can come to the fore on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions in bulk, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the English leaders, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the JJ.OO in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain the brightness of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into a heavy outsider despite the lagoons in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an \"unfair competence in the preparation of the vote\" in a direct allusion to the accusations made by the English press against EC members.
\"They're pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,\" Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to bring advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organised the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the World Cup 2026 to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of options for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be damaged by the weakness of paid TV rights (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: proof
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
One command in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current Head of State will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that one doubts.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends stated that he did not rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision - at some point in the fall of 2011 -
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the MPU members on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of two terms of reference, has provoked a review.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
Simply convey the facts, not an ad.
This is not the first time you've spoken about the presidents, with a playful tone, in meetings of this kind.
\"In the worst, or the best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,\" he had dropped in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: \"Don't think I don't think I'm going to think about what's coming after.\"
His earlier statements no longer bring him closer to the candidature, nor do they less.
There were comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal went to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people of the PS to claim that the battle is organized before expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
\"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject - it has reacted immediately and prudently the Prime Minister's environment.
\"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate\" says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
\"You'll always think you can win - correct Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its procurement of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt emission institute will certainly not be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk worsening a more than complicated situation today in the markets for European bonds.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
\"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.\"...
On the eve of the day, in Brussels, at its hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more eloquentness as to his intentions, indicating only that the State's purchase programme for State letters on the secondary market - continued - and that - we shall see what we decided - during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main unchanging type in 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled last week to around EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt as little as possible that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change in course.
Although lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial and lasting conditions ranging between one week and three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
\"I can't imagine you're going to modify your programme considerably.\"
\"If not, it would risk causing new short-term tensions,\" says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's economist.
“It seems more likely to occur a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal, anticipates.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of those obligations so that the market remains stable, says Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“The lack of investors on the market should be compensated for at any price and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the weaker States,” said an important manager of obligations yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are set by the clouds, States will have even more problems to reduce their indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government captures the tempo
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflow of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
At the conclusion of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as \"undescriptable\" and that one weekend was expected - unpredictable - statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basic points and the price of the bankruptcy-risk cover contracts (CRQs) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain review in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed deep concern about, and possible contagion from Ireland, the turmoil in the markets.
\"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland\"
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of associated incomes, causing the State to risk not being able to meet its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have been a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget being reviewed in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (against 3.9 per cent planned by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, for a total of EUR 7 billion.
\"If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted,\" said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
\"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are smaller than those required by other countries,\" says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of decision-making would be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are reflecting on the strengthening of crisis control mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: \"I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and by day that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone\"
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of obligations of the European States has spurred governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the debt rating of Portugal, the most common target at present for speculation.
\"As in May, political clarity and transparency are missing, which weighs significantly on banking systems,\" said the economists at Exame BNP Paribas.
Especially because - the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets -
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it conceals, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the existing crisis.
Informal consultations among finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of the coming week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Fund for Financial Stability (EFEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has launched a tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issue of FEEF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative had entrusted Reuters to the agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid any cost to request international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and to decide on structural reforms that they consider essential to build lasting confidence.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, raise the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of markets of public obligations.
In passing through Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 75 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional EUR 100,000 million would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A suggestion which would certainly be able to examine European capital in detail.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snows continue to cause difficulties in circulation, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Two-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the strong fall snows affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also slightly negates in Isla de France.
There are expected snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, Météo France alert.
In Côtes d'Armor, several departmental roads have been banned from heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludeac axes.
According to gendarmes, the movement in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it should not be conducted except in case of need and that certain TER vehicles have been banned during the day.
School transportation in Picardia has been banned on Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture - urges all drivers to drive with utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct to the situation -
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday on 25 per cent of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to planned snow.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the island of France has reached its high point, billions of people have been fighting.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro which must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of €4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be the sum that will later allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amendment Finance Act, reviewed in the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is - for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris -
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: \"The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year\"
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices that already exists - to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate it to the Société du Grand Paris -
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
“Tax resources are required to be added to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilized by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment when income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain”
- It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs -
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, where the promised 4,000 million are not on credit, may lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it unravels an apparent scandal, a scandal that seems only scandalous in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The \"extraordinary\" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult do not just trust what they already know, which confirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informer is lazy, just as he is perishable (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sending the US embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same information published by Newsweek the previous week.
Why, then, have the disclosures of these files caused such a review?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e. that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of States can call on the telephone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into spying centers.
Any viewer who sees research movies knows it perfectly, we just seem to know that we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the \"greens\"
But let's get into the real nature of what's happened.
In the past, at the time of Orwell, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction performed, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be held that can no longer retain its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public realm; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a street cartel.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential conversations cannot be expected on the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has moved by plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and therefore, novelism, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked boxes: in the end, Watergate's spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing as a crab, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a telegraph with cables (telephonics).
Video tapes (analogs) had enabled film researchers to study a step-by-step film, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to move from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the displacements it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing unusual for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly being done in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats in its pledges of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the rapidly unblocked financing promises (called fast start or early start) by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $300 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to providing EUR 7.2 billion in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has placed its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was achievable and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion 2010, which puts it on the right track towards meeting its 2012 commitment of €7.2 billion.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be - new and additional - to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what it means - new and additional -
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of -all new projects - of the year 2010 is - new and additional -
In other words, no reference is made to the costs of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), while seeking to respect its commitment to new and additional funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... As much, it should only be computed for its commitments the cost of the loan to the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France does not find such a reasoning useful: \"I respect your commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of grants (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document for your own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that so frequently uses the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending as much as EUR 36.1 million, he managed to give the impression that he spent 420 million - new and additional - as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States to continue giving when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a small, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machinery that is the CMNUC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could move forward the discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the issue of the ‘additional character’ or the method for computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of the ‘additional character’ and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals on one day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results - they do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with - acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the food that usually consumes a 10-year-old child in four meals and an attempt daily.
These meals taken as models, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the gorges, were examined in laboratories for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
\"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying,\" says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as an attempt for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a forbidden fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green Jews in Kenya, including in the food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were adhered to with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon roll was the most - nourishing - with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these “polluter cocktails” for the consumer is probably underestimated, says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV) has, for its part, proposed, in the face of the gravity of the situation, a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb the increase in diseases associated with civilization.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
