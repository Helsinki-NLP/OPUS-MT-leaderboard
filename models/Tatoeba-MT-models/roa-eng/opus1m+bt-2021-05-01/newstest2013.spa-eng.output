A republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy because of the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments enacted, from 2009 onwards, new laws that made the process of registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 2011 in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce pre-voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photographed identity document.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
Consequently, the republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photographed identity document.
It is important to bear in mind that, unlike what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photographed identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions therefore disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens aged over 65 and 20 per cent of voters aged between 18 and 29 do not have a photographed identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states students, voters who vote the most for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with a photograph issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who often vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for electors who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in a drop in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state's electors.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same thing.
These represent only 11 per cent of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor ' s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this respect, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: Test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men doubt, already reluctant of themselves, about whether detection tests should be carried out.
Do the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies conducted in the United States identified a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there is between 30 and 40 per cent chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not harm the long-term life, in which case they should opt rather for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or has a risk for their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor about whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of illness.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, they could prevent about 30% of cancers.
\"If no one smokes, that rate would rise to at least 50%,\" said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we evaluate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
\"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,\" said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the occurrence of the disease, according to CSC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer, adds.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they scale the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuteria products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for its smoke, dry or salty can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
\"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer,\" they tell us.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their investigations are not conclusive.
Following CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer in one of them, an increase was observed in another.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clear.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each one's family concerns and background with his or her doctor.
“Making the detection test does not cause cancer”
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great commotion last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or -less bad - explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely secure.
Anyway, we suppose it's Higgs, because the chances of making a mistake seem small. We'll see what this is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it will end up harming itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same quantum state, a \"state\", which is largely composed of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called ferrets, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories' Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of whom we will not speak here, and the \"power particles\" by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I would stress here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the \"light particle\" that acts as \"messenger\" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it \"disorders\" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this - disorder - an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons - force bearers -
Most stable field
It is the same with Higgs' boson, with the difference that it is about another field, Higgs' field, which needs to be \"disordered\" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it requires extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the large hadron collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself attached to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way), do not have it.
What, though, can they bring in all these investigations?, Mrs Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to check the differences between the observations and the predictions of MS.
For its part, many earnestly desire to be found, as the least difference could open a door to a \"new physics\" that tapes certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
To see: In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would cause.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked at Bell's laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a laboratory apparatus -
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also proceed from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not his original intention at all, this capturer now serves as a “eye” for all digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that it is never known...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission Died in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him on the lookout.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
\"I've been given five years of life, but I've already been seven,\" says a passerby, lying in her bed at the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Centre in Beloeil, the day before.
\"But it's always a shock, we can't be ready for this,\" he continues.
The disease has caused damage to him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating for himself.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Valiente, even smiles, talks to strangers who care for her, bring her medicines and offer her a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
\"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating,\" she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man is walking on foot,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer care - care - care - care -
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die — conscious and drowned —
But the disease has made your children discover.
\"I have good children,\" he adds.
\"I don't have any more desires left in this life,\" she says, before accepting to be put in a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for one last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we all know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
Moribundo is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of daily life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who enjoyed his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
\"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 sick of cancer,\" Dr. Christiane Martel says.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarvent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal Homeland Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
“I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency, suffering great pains without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care -
And in parallel, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was really sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
\"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do.\"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who claim to die are grateful to their caregivers that they have not been treated in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of their death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelief disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: \"I want to die\"
But that does not necessarily mean - I want euthanasia - but - I want them to relieve me -
The performance of this report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the Canadian health research institutes.
Larger real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable system of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
An industry, which was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, particularly in the 1990s and 2000.
“It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted the big media,” ironic Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement of road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of that moment, Jean Charest, had only allowed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts, containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission - now has dropped two mayors - adds, as long as it hopes to get to -show the existing stratagems behind the individuals -
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of interveners, researchers and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police officers of the Marteau Squad, who, since 2009, have made Montreal’s “cartel of sewage” moderate in terms of inflating contracts.
These last few weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial record of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, third city in Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambipo, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused commotion in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the ‘system’ for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary connected to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambico distributed money to both right-hand and left-handed during the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 (about 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Prime Minister Liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the \"corruption system\" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprisent, former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and corporate bribes from the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials on the road network have admitted that they received money to inflate the invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately making the fat view to a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arks.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a massive crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that sounded the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls from a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.
And he adds that the process is - painful, but positive -
We are cleaning the wounds but there would be a need for a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that questionable practices do not repeat.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, but he is particularly concerned about the role of politicians elected in the field of strategy.
In an estimated 70% of the proportion of dirty money that was devoted to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironies: - I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality -
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he said, while the electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.
It calls for a comprehensive review of the system for the award of public contracts and for the financing of parties: - we cannot fall lower; to go to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws -
If this story permeates the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look in the mirror.
\"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona\"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Day-to-day advance by your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't calm down.
From my beginnings in INF Clairefontaine's pre-forming center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to gigantic steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to dispute very high-level parties.
They know every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has a lot to do with my position.
It is backed up by deputies like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one the same in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I was just getting out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have ranked for the eighths of the finals in style.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say in front of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our leagues in front of the Port so that we can receive the round of octaves at the end.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You've got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means for that project to be realized.
Don't win the drink in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking on that title of champions.
In the last season, we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimum conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still encounter things that reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We'll never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has not managed to rank for eighths of the final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well during the previous season, have been “pulsed” by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a \"Zlatandependence\"
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
He's come to prove that he's the star of League 1.
And he's demonstrated on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all of us to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 Eurocopa with the team in France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the \"blues\"
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and to that we must have exemplary behavior today.
What do you see from Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the blues?
You're getting results.
They are well located in the ranking group for the World.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Anything contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The quote of bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before today's round of the ten dollars (quotations are on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as - the most successful virtual currency - - which competes with the dollar or the euro - and -similar to conventional currencies -
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as the (credited) used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even occasionally be exchanged).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositaries of books of accounting, verifiers, cash issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins consist of the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file-threading, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter, unique number mark.
Computers - cogent - the new transaction and add a number before -throttle - the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular print (zeror at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in deposit.
“The fault used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash shows the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80 percent of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the \"giant rebbles\" were launched.
“$ 30,000 has been changed,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus leave cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can - photograph and recognize - needs Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change — it predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are considered high today, if this currency succeeds.
We've come out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take over possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished, above all, the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but also often with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks or the Tajik are joined to their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which observed from above the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was made in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban to Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His taking control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old muyahidines, the present government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, turning into government land to set them up as solars for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given jobs that they will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opposition, are avid mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstitute the provincial militias, who will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has reestablished its services, no packaging has been fixed, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing except fruits and vegetables is produced.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth was expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the soil and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools of girls, schools of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying - to win hearts and spirits - and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of - civil and military actions - of the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, greedy of local labor, have helped to contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in these valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well-controlled and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of State had given that Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt used an interim text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has done nothing but increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his \"autocratic delirium\" and continues \"traitioning his word\" and \"pistoing the right\"
Their supporters ensure that this is a step towards a faster end to the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: -or they vote my text or I keep full powers - powers that are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent, Islamist Assembly, in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not come to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, substitute members, were added to all speed yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I expected, the articles voted were unanimous.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee thought that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all glances, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that - the principles of Shariah constitute the main source of the law -
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that the principles could be replaced by -the rules - which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals mocked him for hypocrisy and felt that this was nothing more than an advertising device.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers an advisory role on Al-Azhar University, in particular on anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy -
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next head of that university would be rather less moderate than the present one.
\"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not ulemes but university students, some of them formed in the French system, explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
‘We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be raised in the future would be to what extent the civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves above all this -
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the powers extended to the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil prosecutions in military courts will not be prohibited, as human rights associations requested.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could lead to serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to leave yesterday night on television, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
The supporters of the head of State manifested themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world, and a sea of salmon
The promised earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
\"AIF\" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone who enters this baptismal pile is believed to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here go through the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin \"Via Dolorosa\").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues on the streets of the Old City, it goes to the Holy Sepulchre at Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unción and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Father of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave note here with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Massed Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And reach there by their own means, they can only those who devote themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
From the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
You won't be able to visit them all on one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Rali, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall by 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold up to those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salt water, salmon and healing bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Oldness
It preserves them the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk along the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your-mism, symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples from newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, - to take - the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the people speak Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There we offer a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of sauces, the falafel, which are soft chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that - if they walk to their liking - are impressive.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The rumourers love the places they go to and don't reject the gorges.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bike will go out for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% to the same index as in 2010, before the cancellation of visa regime on 9 February 2011.
“The great and powerful” will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While Members and Human Rights Defenders are discussing the consequences that the law on compulsory examination would bring, Timings have already appeared in the country dealing with certificates-false.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens from Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each migrant worker must carry out a test to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be sufficient to give the language examination, if not also that of Russian history and the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is the citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
It will not be subject to this law to persons who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examining centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of the Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants may be tested in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the Deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, have often succeeded in asking the press this question: What will this actually bring?
What changes will make knowledge of the language compulsory for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service responded, which would reduce the number of people suffering - labour slavery -
Many people talk today about defending the rights of labour migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
Immigrants have problems without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a \"paid traveler\" to a creepy, narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
\"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay them the promised wages\" confirms the Head of the Employment Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but your own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give to eat the children, not to talk about dressing them anymore, to wear them and to buy them what is necessary for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
\"One feels humiliated and inferior\"
However, as far as the law on language is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
Tests will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
\"Welcome or prohibited the passage to strangers\"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and by only a thousand quintessential rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and the extortion cases appear.
\"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,\" said Tajikistan's citizen, Umed Hushkadamov.
- Come on, don't be silly, buy a paint.
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several \"false\" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the “diplomas” cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have passed the exam the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is fairly low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly with respect to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting during weddings in which there were no fortunate victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscovite lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for arms licensing, from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the 'hard-handed policy'.
An open letter has appeared on the network, the authors of which, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, require that such measures of \"non-sensical rigour\" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, commented on the BBC news service in Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms crimes registered in internal bodies were committed during six months of 2012 compared with the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any low-priced weapon can be found in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked at the Ministry of Education and in the Upper State.
Screenshot of the website accepting arms requests
The first — the army or military — is the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the same Caucasian officers,” Baranets says.
The following type of black weapon - stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are the stolen weapons of the police stores and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are being sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
\"There are proven versions that some fires were caused premeditatedly to cover the fault,\" comments an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including Moscow’s,” the expert said.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where are the guns coming from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Public Management Analysis and Planning Centre.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and portal public access data whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market's weapons have arrived there, because of officials whose work is related to arms, as stated in the report.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons came from areas where armed conflict existed, 14 per cent of the cases were stolen during weapons production and 5 per cent were illegal archaeology.
Dependent on one of the arms stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military stores when they need a match.
Through some aldehyde, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
\"This brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers\" tells us
\"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so on a regular basis, when the crime discovery plan is to be carried out, they carry out test purchases for illegal arms traders,\" he adds.
“As in a luxury boutique”
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
\"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the platform \"Begovaya\" where I would be a man who would take me to a \"esquinite\" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found myself there only -
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
\"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts,\" says the shopkeeper. \"I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much.\"
In the markets there are sellers, but there too must be arrived, say - on the part of Mr Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen to his daughter -
I can even get a couple of steel knobs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to blow it.
Newborns are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was available.
Schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't everything.
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military recalled.
To the buyer, according to Baranets' words, they do not offer cat per hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, do not just buy; we go with the salesman to the woods, where we put a target.
\"Give me the chance to shoot, and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,\" the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of \"Vkontakte\" where we offer to buy weapons for different purposes.
This does not require any document or personal encounters.
\"It's enough to have a certain amount of money,\" they wrote in the title of the advertising notice, \"Buying a gun or machine gun.\"
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
\"Without permission, of course,\" asked the user \"Iván\" (preserved spelling).
\"I buy TT. Moscow gun,\" he asked, \"Fedorenkov.\"
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captured by two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal from Siberia
military commentator and ex-militar Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
\"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the weapon is hidden,\" reports the NGO's press secretary - The Right to Arms - Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets states that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and placed in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captured by two hands those who want to buy firearms.
\"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal from Siberia,\" he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to NGO Dmitri Kislov - The Right to Arms - a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half will have to be waited.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle rank chiefs.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which constitutes 22.900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are put on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in ŞMcDonald's Â
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been launched in the Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as \"McDonald's\" -Burger King - - Taco Bell - - Wendy's - and -Kentucky Fried Chicken - in the United States.
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and dawn in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages earned by Walmart's workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving, the so-called \"Black Friday\" on that day, in the United States was co-embracing the orgy of lowlands that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, who employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside left-wing unions and activists in the corporate stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate income people.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their shops are of an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of mounting or hand scanners.
That - Black Friday - the participants in the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
California University scientists at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary up to $12 an hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, every visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters comment satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The \"Black Friday\" extended in its shops from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview on the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job - fewer than five - employees of Walmart and that the protest had been nothing more than - another trick of public relations - organized by the workers' union.
\"Free Download\"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not precisely the big Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is none), but the \"McDonald's\" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers are receiving $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the samplers, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at a Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Protest participants, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e., double their current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of labour unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing trade union activists with cunning and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the most important is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordant
Rough protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: \"McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work\"
Protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example the city mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that - we must support fast food workers in order to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorkan deserves -
As the New York Times reported, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people work in New York City.
It is still unclear whether this will be a spark to provoke a massive movement.
\"For now, deceiving the brain isn't so easy.\"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology fans, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at its annual Google conference, a model was shown in motion and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its large mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years forward and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in controlling for gestures.
- What else will the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has led the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world must be liberated from computer science to our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, you are still waiting to resolve the privacy issue, since you don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each one in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed, number of frames per second, is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it can be mentioned that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work to be an equivalent of such a device, but not to require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the infrared beam emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible diaphragm sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smart phone high in your hands, it's not very convenient, but I think: the best option would be an increased, transmutable reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to the smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film - Iron Man - but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and the machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in quality support for the image.
Register the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented to providing tangibleness to these - images in the air - for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is given a similar feeling to that one feels if someone was blowing it in the herds, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space creates that it goes to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, tricking the brain isn't that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
\"Rosbalt\" continues the \"Vanguardismo de San Petersburg\" project dedicated to the citizens in front, the avant-garde of art and culture.
On this list of the best figures are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even knowing Russia.
The new hero of \"Rosbalt\" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophers of St Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's avant-garde at the end of the 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organelle and became the organeller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of properties that are not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the smell of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who took \"Pushkinskaya-10\" and the new wave was over.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not for the lyrics.
And all of this got together at your art clinic-- it was important to me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian San Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to - Van Gogh's ear -
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became “Leningrad”
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery -D 137 - the -Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was - The people of our city -
In the nomination - Artist of the Year - I was elected, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little worshiped.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are Hits, in which the present and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to make a programmed exhibition, the Russian Museum in clowns,
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything gets pregnant and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by means of a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by the clothes, orienting the outside, but not within the person.
And, maybe that person wasn't supposed to give a hand, but spit it on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
- Recently we saw you on the role of an urban planner.
Who better than me to be!
- Good, but can the best commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people gathered in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simples.
Now everyone has been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come in for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, there's the sex-social sphere.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes off.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you've accomplished.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had hung them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: cultural officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones, everything was different, the kings may not have understood culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level that properly evaluates them and opens the way for them.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same is true, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But about our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people curious who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board depart in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How can the species continue in conditions of ingravity or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
\"These are Venus and Mars,\" says Chief Investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insect breeding in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to the area to check how the embryo is developed in conditions of ingravity.
We got as a result a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chicken has to find support, must stay on its own feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When there was no support, the chickens turned upside down at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Pollutants did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
\"And twice we got the chickens born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,\" says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological miniark flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, in the biosatellite-Bion, only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, who were already sent to space with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
\"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,\" says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the spatial rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
\"After all, no one has answered this question,\" comments the aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told that after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
\"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights,\" says the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the cosmonauts preparation centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation of the flight.
In null buoyancy conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, yet still hostile, environment for a newborn child is its birthplace.
The little amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found about 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is very little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary for women.
In the ingravity of the abdominal and pelvis muscles are very fast decrepitated, the ejection capacity of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we skip that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
And then what, Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
\"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will give rise to our bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person,\" said Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Biomedical Problems.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system - švarc - has not been carried out with the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and high-quality legislation, although its implementation is consistent.
Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) said this in an interview for Aktualně.cz.
\"The law will never be perfect,\" but its application must be correct. \"This is, in my opinion, what we lack,\" thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of self-government only on the paper, which is known as the \"švarc\" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to require obligations,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is - more stringent and more complete - however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring about? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing in the creation of laws, the reduction and the improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the invitations to tender, it means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with as much - papeleo - that those who want to look for failures in the system can do it more easily than if the limits are kept as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, like the NKU, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college also, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The competences are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would generally not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately defined in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, for the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but I repeat, I don't like making such comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't make them any benefit to collaborate with our office, would it?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Is its impact expressed in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool of - non-economic risk detection - by which we have passed almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection and the same process are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a scam for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem may arise is that the regulation - if it hardens - and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the above regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each law not respected in the field of public procurement meant breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother employers with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being self-governing only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office from acting under the obligation to carry out such controls and to require obligations.
You can say, \"We change the law and we allow it,\" but you can't say that we'll do it as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the legislation is quite strict as to how it should be acted formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads present ice and snowboards.
Although most roads are transitable, caution should be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented ice and snowboards.
The temperature will come down and range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
Instead, in the ridges of the Metallic Mountains, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor because of fog, according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The R6 rapidway and the first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and rebalancing.
In addition, all second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still traces of ice and snow seasoning.
Road attention needs to be increased, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové Region
On some roads in East Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a snow layer on the tracks, informs the Road and Highway Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice plates forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, using nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a snow layer seasoned in the highest areas of roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three low zero and one positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although caution should be exercised and time adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snow and the subsequent fall in temperatures, some pathways could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region's Road Operations Control Centre.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the track between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and ice free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area bordering with Germany, there may be ice plates.
The second and third categories are wet, so, in this case, we also warn you of ice plates.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially in the least-passed routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers moving to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be partially dumped with snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the way to Videlský kříž.
Road operators took the snow out during the night; on the Šumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to track administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
In the highest areas of the Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers at the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-waste snow towards Jesseník - today confirmed an operator of the road administration from Šumper to ČTK.
On the ground and at night they came to the Jessencá also their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks in the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitable without restrictions, in Šternberská the drivers should drive cautiously in the forest sections, where the tracks are still wet.
Ústí region nad Labem and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different stages at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the mmentum.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced since the general roads on road I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut down by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarm news that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you organized a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state-owned act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the Maya calendar set out at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
The day before, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time when the Maya calendar ends on Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to you?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title \"End of the world, cancelled\"
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it in charity concerts?
Of course it will, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All the interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many benefits and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to care and enjoy working with us.
To what will the money collected at the concerts be spent against the end of the world?
To equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkėv ustav.
The students at the school of Jedličkŭv ustav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkŭv ustav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague you will act Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustrosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other - spectacular - similar action in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips like?
It's not as difficult as it might look at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
With the exits abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not common for a person to travel alone through the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in an elevator wheelchair, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects to which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrierless society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I joined as an educator in Jedličkėv ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La Â ́a Angelovič says, we got a little bit of hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't come up until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's assistance, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those who should be compassionate.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be rigorous in many ways and demand discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they are found that they have to go for two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently, the Tap Tap Group has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There is Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever wants and wants will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda of Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conferencing to sing together the song of The Tap Tap-End of the world, cancelled-
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrierless educational centre in Jedličkėv used in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entrance to the front sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of ESA of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the agency's project commission in the following years.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study \"Introduction to cosmonautica\"
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award in France for its \"Introduction to cosmonautica\"
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a cosmonautic promoter, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland and was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who the author of the proposal was, and the highlights of the project are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for braking.
The information about this drain is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Starting in 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the research reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 it appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study \"Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza\" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committeeet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics was proposed.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since early 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronomical Studies (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and air tests of two-stage RM-2 rockets in the Błędów desert began in the summer of 1959.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed by the space available to scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests were started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the problem that exists from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
This means, therefore, that the different forms of economics and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited private capital movement, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so - it causes a downside - of the price of the competitor in order to be made with most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most employers, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where labour prices, compared to other economies, are higher.
Due to the fact that private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment caused by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state is necessarily increasing.
This whole situation fosters the total disinterest of employers for paying taxes and compensates for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for benefits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people who receive this kind of help is already up to a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abismal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a poor wage on the edge of society, hoping that one day they will reach the country's private investor capital.
Do you need to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media assert to the satire that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, in the whole state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills for private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
These kinds of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation like the one describing Appiànos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: \"The state was taking time disintegrating and the administrations occupied themselves with force.\"
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained unlawfully and aid to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread unhindered and the people came to the polls with the vote applauded in advance - ... - there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls -... -He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a energetic man -... Although Appiannos thought in Pompeya, Caesar came up to power and turned democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of the individual benefit without taking account of the common interests.
Private capital is essentially unable to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, a decline in the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The real thing is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes of which we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
\"That noting comes from violence and noting ever could\" (There is nothing from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his Fragile song and whose shrill prays\"Let's do not forget how fragile we are (let's not forget how fragile we are).
\"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no wars.\"Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right to self-defense and to encase the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the repeated killings and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the roof, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of power struggles is in the forefront.
At each time we can find a Great Alejandro or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power involved, it has not been possible to reach a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written near them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or a war is being waged: before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gadafi only four remaining, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for sparking the huge economic crisis of 1929.
His eagerness for world power led them in the 1859s - 1871s to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd grade.
The first war was marked as an objective to eliminate the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second was to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third was to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (like the number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chaos - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, following the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unwarranted from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In order to prepare the land of the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflictable situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Afterwards, they relied on serving the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was sufficiently strong and simple and pointed to the culprits, and then building a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which seized the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler took too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied it at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel being set the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now along with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel are divided in a cutting way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice breed injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where it spends 20% of the entire world oil (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now the words David Rockefeller made in 1994 show: \"The only thing we need is a general crisis and the people will be in accordance with a new world order\"
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serve a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his entire being.
“And it obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, to add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six -
Filma Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was going to be in exchange for the demonized Shah Mohamed Reza Páhlevi, who, after the revolution, fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats in prison were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and excitement against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film \"Argo\" by the director and actor Ben Affleck feared an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help a covert story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction overproduction.
Gender combination
The plan brought by the expert in - exfiltration - Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production society had even a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film was made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a call - caper movie - the story of an episode that went well, a trick (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand we find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
For the other, typical Hollywood scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men brought who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to reboot his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been ridiculed, had become a respectable director and his manner of action had ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after -Adieus petitico, Adios - (2007) and the thriller - The Town. City of thieves - (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is \"ruised\" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introductory sequence of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic ability that, at the same time, transmits the excitement of the misunderstanding and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn't go out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis comes in at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become a madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, let alone, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that's gonna be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on -the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop -
“It was after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in European big companies,” explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women were at better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
‘Other incredible ideas at the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year’
The election will take place at the end of February 2013 - Nacher reported.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of hens' cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the expression - buttering of butter - or the removal of the classic bulb from the trades has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus takes this kind of decision often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present - abnormal curvatures -
The European Commission has argued that this only seeks to harmonize non-homogenous national standards to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules which refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU last year that in the inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction on the use of olive trees by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: everyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for preserved mushrooms, which posed a substantial fine threat to it.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
\"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation - the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) declared in the fall of 2004.
He argued that much cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
At the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended for the drafting of applications for Brussels grants.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often critical, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, in the same way as other countries in the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always come out victorious from these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of the Olomouc request, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and came to be called \"tuzemák\"
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official EU list of protected designations of origin, together with the known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the Mazapan of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, are already found for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected seas from the EU, they may be proud of the Pardubice ginger bread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did it happen to you to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer stand to see how it gets stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, tax increases and retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it is set on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected Senator, I would submit my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
This is the addition of the media, who despise you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists what I have been counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do so, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guidance office to be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or from the left, they are rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if anyone's on the right or on the left, I want to join the people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
He's joking when you're told he's populist.
But you're not showing it by what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only one word left.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you turn to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If elected President, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
Let us take the direct choice of the President, who has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I've just started in politics, and I'm trying to get as much support as I can for my programme.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with one person I don't do anything, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they'd rather be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out frauds with light heating oils.
I came in on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have any money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about the property statements, how's his?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another flat taxed eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in one million, and in the account I have a couple million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that he does not have any sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my programme.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive as Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't introduce myself as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before I left this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you get to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I were president, then I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed - Book Mountain - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a street passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: \"In addition, the building is beautiful\"
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody gets into those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And this was how policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a whole master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings to the pair that cynics, took the theme with its usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked around and shuddered with shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words:-Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called \"Boekenberg\" -
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize -Best Library of NL 2012 -
In addition, the project is also nominated for the “Dutch National Wood Award 2012”
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly township behind whose white façade one would institute a central dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheesepot.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climbing to the top.
The fully crystallized interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor picked up and the elegant headlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upon raising the view you can get to view the banks of the park, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“The book shelves are usually arranged along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that usually is uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classical spatial configuration on top and remove the reading area from the interior to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and barricade at the same time.
The view, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more day by day shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
\"We wanted to work with recycled materials,\" Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse explains.
And this is like one day, on a frying farm, we meet with the proper by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and camps of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of only a few millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is cheap and efficient material.
This thin tissue lasts for two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was first taken in such quantities until it obtained four-centimeter thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 pellets you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the coffee shop not only you have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy a tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant, even atmosphere that maintains the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
\"Even if it is hard to believe it because of its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology,\" Trouborst says.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of crystal, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located cross-section to the glass façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is the thing about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic information technology worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the \"Boekenberg\" as the \"late soul\" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, because of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps in a library that does not yet have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has fallen deep.
The shelves are full.
\"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library,\" architect Winy Maas says.
\"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in that discipline, which in the specialized slang is known as the creation of an identity.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
At last a starting point to make up your identity.
Szabo: -The Germans must play a more important role -
Germany had abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a diplomatic position that is far from clear.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, as it were, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore at a crossroads.
Of them they are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a normal foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a German-speaking foreign policy really mean?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend different positions than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to win a certain respect.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not excited about the politics he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a peliagudo theme.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or maybe it's still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used to it, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to find it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany is the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be around enemy countries.
Given this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European policy is decreasing more and more, but the EU does not now cover this vacuum, who remains then?
The Germans will not be more remedied than taking on a more important role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it turns them into an even more unpopular people, it's life!

‘Mark protection’ in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden an officially registered name in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
A new case comes to my desk every week.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened to the Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archive where he saves seats from Beijing's brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of forgeries.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. In charge of his clients, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it \"Bang Ming Pai\" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term (Bang Dakuan)
which refers to women who have (fished) a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
\"It is harmful to the business, we must fight it,\" Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous”
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and the one growing at a higher rate.
However, achieving the annulment of questionable legal registration in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long since the name of the lawsuit had already become a \"market reality\"
“If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay the plagiarizer money because the process has damaged the brand in China,” says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost an argument against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that remembered BMW to a large extent; the matter was dealt with in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, - the job emergency situation returned to normal -
In this way, the amount of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usually common in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China has been leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yuan would have been paid for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitater has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
\"We ourselves have provoked this situation because the surnames are not protected in Germany,\" says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the use of munitions.
The following two instances have given Freudenberg reason, but the opposite party continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler trusted that the issue could be resolved favorably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that -the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time -
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing side a six-digit euro, with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care about it,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if the copyists secure the rights on unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather products in Germany.
The group has long since abandoned this trade area, however, it has been able to prevent registration.
Wentzler says that you should be very careful.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be highly prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is - to register in China, too, everything that may be likely to be protected - as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic may be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsed and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice in
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasines search for the compass on parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do they slowly begin to raise the voices of the singers (contalto, bass, tenor and soprano), waving, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his quarters by trying to order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, from 23 to 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the owner of the house.
\"Om'Obani\" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a foreign language hardly known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS programme, worldwide, exists about 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voice for Africa Association has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month a child can be affiliated.
This contribution will cover the tuition of the school, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in story-narrator zulu - the -panegrist -
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years, this choir has been testing songs in this soft foreign language, which is sometimes able to transport them to their place of origin — southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers straight from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see with good eyes circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion to half.
More than 40% of Suaziland's inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying over thirty years has become usual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this modern population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, opportunities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few what made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the Association-Voices for Africa, which has since taken professional care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Acts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial TSEs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The lattice and sardines are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most often given in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomenas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect 15-25-year-olds.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinal discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
Pesticides may reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections due to dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for their actions throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
\"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,\" says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of herself and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany.
It makes sure that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The \"gogogos\" are the pillars of the village, as the older women are called in Zulu.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care of the children going to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, \"Voices of Africa\" has set up a sewing school, has built two hens and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people to undergo an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is all over the country, it is not usually spoken openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted life-form is largely responsible for the spread so rapid that it has experienced HIV in recent decades.
But it is also because of the countless timers who travel the country from one side to another and carry it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, -in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin.
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, a combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many on the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and great joy with you, but has also managed to draw a couple of tears from someone other rabid frontier soldier.
The trip always takes you to Esitjeni, where singers visit the children in love.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River Valley is well known.
\"Close to Esitjeni, there shines the light,\" the local people say.
And after travelling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine their light from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the nearest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water, as it emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine \"Science\"
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
Water is presumably derived from comets or, most likely, asteroids that in its day clashed with Mercury.
No one relates the find of ice to the possibility that there is life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
Findings, however, could help clarify how water and other life components have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertent for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.

Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no - planet -
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a \"family portrait\" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue spots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars - newborns -
This region of star formation, called in a romantic way by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunflower image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.

In the huge Trifida Nebula, at 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known with the nickname \"The Seven Sisters\" are a visible object just visible in the night sky.
With the telescope, however, colors can be better appreciated.
The Helice Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.

One of the biggest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Moulin Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Austral European Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term ‘trifidus’ (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic snail: to 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are shaken one towards the other to end up shocking in an irremediable way.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefeo.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, known as Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also continuously new stars; at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become ever deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tajas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signs.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the \"External Intelligence Search\" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer by providing processing capacity.
View of the Austral European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 you don't expect to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together explores the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescope.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the start of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane rocket 5 until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers are based on the fact that there is ice in the southern pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no powerful evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure it is.

A search for prints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of Talysh Mountain could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus progresses with great rush through the winding road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here, the \"talyshi\" live a town that you don't know much about, apart from that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and that are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit completely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is of one direction.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May because of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Talyshis from the place that have surpassed 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to an image in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslmov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslmov's age is quite suspicious.
“Nation in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslmov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
\"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very advanced elderly people,\" says Scholz, \"even in Sardinia there are many older men\"
Because of the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; even if there is no civil record.
Every day glass filled with melted butter
It is a fact that the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talyshis.
The museum's director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in feeding.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich food of Talyshi, who worship meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what he looks like in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves tirelessly a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from side to side two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical vases with an abundance of shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the cloth hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son discovers to us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept its color.
\"I've never used a shampoo either,\" Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping in my whole life for a supermarket.
Then he tells us about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, it all returned to its caucus when the \"queered father\" Heydar Aliyew took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult which professes to the father figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for monthly pension, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's candid son is right: \"In our culture the elderly are highly respected\"
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression \" Human Rights \"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Events that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is being left.
The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, is very controversial.

We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God - he said on public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, left unmedicated so far in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand theirs - in order to save the revolution -
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that case law is based on the principles of Islamic law.
However, what does that mean of \"principles\"
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: on all issues relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it aims to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression over the opposition.
After the dictator’s fall up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and — to promote its morals and values —
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it is to be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits the “offence to persons”
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for its signature and that according to his words, - very soon - will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
The revolution is back.
The opposition has been closing ranks in front of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cario and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
\"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,\" says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies third place on the lists in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be - in the garbage bin of history -
Twitter accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a state coup against democracy.
“When the referendum is convened, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said opposition Jasser Said.
\"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been spared,\" was quoted in Egyptian media to opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
\"The Qur'an is our constitution\"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: \"The people demand the application of the divine law\"
They demanded Morsi - to clear the country - at the same time they proclaimed: - the Qur'an is our constitution -
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk that such a thing would happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction should follow the country.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of Islamists has the majority guaranteed.
- The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear -
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and had included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
\"And now the expression `Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution - she laments in a conversation with the newspaper \"Welt am Sonntag\"
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestant in Tahrir Square warns: \"You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.\"
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most malleable fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country is connected to its greed with a highly malleable fish?
Take a number of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty football clothes and wet.
Leave him there for a week.
You can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I meet in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is trucked in salad that gets fermented in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and it's getting colder, the Norwegians go to a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captivating.
“He eats raw and then drinks a glass of a drink aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, city fireman who is also what is known as the “General of the Rakfisk”, who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink large amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was stored during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes not much richer than Norway, arrives in Sweden to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite malolient, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as the event of 22 July.
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth, there has been growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
\"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well,\" says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde meen and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
\"We are, as you say, prudent people.\"
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone wasted money that he did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
\"While we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,\" says Anna.
\"And eat rakfisk,\" he adds with a carcapped development.
I'm in the snow doing glue to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, come back that nasty fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the eaters vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nasal pits most.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears a pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
\"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen\"
\"Here's our score, Havard\"
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant, examines the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, has been installed since Monday a steel siege that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already been charged around 60,000 lives in six years.
\"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,\" Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
\"I would like to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.\"
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was the governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bubolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To reach the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the steep roads and full of basins that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sportsman and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
\"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change,\" says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's lack of essence of the new president.
He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen.
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the busy streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the city's problems are also hard and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
The most critical accused his administration of making the fat view.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
\"When I came to her house, it seemed as if she had been cleaned up,\" Mrs. Buendía recalls.
\"There were signs that it had been struck and the rigor mortis had already appeared\"
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross where one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
The state authorities treated me like an old gossip, a bully, a chink.
What they want is for one simply to accept what they say and to shut up —
\"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect,\" he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to give priority during his term of office.
\"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was a governor,\" says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not reported ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuses during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leaking of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation the prosecution conducted at Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which was conducted during a hearing conducted following the defence ' s request that the case be dismissed as his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already been sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after the visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was in prison under maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celebrators as \"excellent\" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as \"very professional\"
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had talked about those problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not leave any record of those issues on the record.
\"They wrote 'no incidences' (after talking about problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems,\" Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she had received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the injury prevention regime under which he was under.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below the possible suicide surveillance, to ensure their protection and safety of others.
“I wanted the higher state to know that I was okay and (I wanted to) stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening to him in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to the Arafjon Camp, to that cage,” Manning explained on Thursday.
\"I thought I was going to die in that cage.\"
Manning said that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some heels, some clothes and their glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the blinds couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the statement of Thursday, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell of Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to remain bare in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the questioning of the judge on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given by the locksmith that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his heels to self-harm but that he had not done so.
Manning testified that that night they had taken their underwear, their heels and their glasses out of their cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he has experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he is convicted on the war council, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defence stated that Manning is planning to make Manning guilty of minor offences and to defend other charges considered to be too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information from the national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had hardly come down from the explade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for \"Mexicans\" and one for \"Foreign\"
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
By growing up in Central California, all my life I've been called \"Mexican\"
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as \"irlanders\" or my friends in New York qualify themselves \"Italian\"
Later I decided to \"Mexican-American\"
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
It was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the foreign queue.
I thought about that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as long as the leaders of these two countries meet, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as an adventure to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style commercial block in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although it did not provide details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, at the time a U.S. official says anything that leads to the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand on the side of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that is really a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do we talk about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, to whom the opportunity door in Mexico was closed and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, low level of studies, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living now the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like it.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we would not be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more strongly who they are and the second this upsets them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered to be part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, folks.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more - Mexicans - than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first started, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to them whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional albonot.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal death-point situation could be disengaged.
A War That Is Not Lost or Won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire is kept up on 21 November, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their behalf.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissant regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas' exultant members say that the half-moon Islamist is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulá militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most populous and fundamental difference in the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' first brothers and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will rise as the protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israel Iron Summit anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier running from the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and it protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international legislation, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why migrate those Palestinian retorts by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dust that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The fearsome missions against Gaza every two or three years to refuse Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that of sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of arms into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join in.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, she seems equally reluctant to devote her attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on green black boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of an olive green blackout, some frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the cajetillas, compulsory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small type of source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking through the elimination of traits that make this habit glamorous.
It trusts studies that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he or she will never do so.
“It can be seen that children, even at an early age, understand the message the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect too much the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
\"The legislation will bring serious involuntary consequences,\" said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that the counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring to the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claimed that the demand for pickles and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a bill in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stocks.
\"For us it's a good business\"
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you sell tobacco and you only have this little window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to stay,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from - on-site citizens - posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You may wonder if it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what involves new regulations than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibsek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are now mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
The photographs don't affect me.
I simply don't listen to them.
“Take the cigarette and save the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
\"Usually, there is only one reason why I would quit smoking: for my daughter\"
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more complicated to put them on the shelves.
\"It usually took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four,\" says Yu.
\"The government should have totally banned tobacco, and then, that's it, okay, it ended and closed the store,\" he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad getting bored a little bit
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we willingly accept boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book - Boredom: A Lively History - - The boredom, an animated story - published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
\"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,\" he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin on the boredom that date from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
\"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,\" says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of - wanting, but not being able, participating in an activity that fills you with -
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he states, is - the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly -
Boring may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider it to be the problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study: The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a television program at all volumes that kept no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was hard for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored”
\"In fact, at present we know that moving or garbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert\"
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to be quiet,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a - scale trend towards boredom -
The scale includes issues like - a lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous - and -there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything -
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which 400 adolescents and their parents were contacted seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found out that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he wasn't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that - adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest odds - largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method to fight it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
\"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,\" says Gary Marcus, psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
\"So, if your son is bored and gives him an iPad, he may no longer get bored, but he won't learn to entertain himself or dose himself,\" says Professor Fenske.
And this capacity for dosing applies to other situations, he points out.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate it to something that is worth it,” she says.
It points out that what people really look for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
\"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,\" he says, \"it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.\"
Colorado: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student in a community and football institute in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving around Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (child crimes involving each of them a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
\"They treat us like criminals,\" Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes due to drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes by possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana stores from opening up in their communities.
\"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next,\" said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in Washington State are also turning the matter around.
They continue to seek advice to establish a system of licences for production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all of this before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
\"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model,\" he says.
The Washington Law, called I-502, came into force on 6 December, which also leaves for a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to offer adequate access to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio below 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds, playgrounds or children's centres.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Legal Cannabis Centre, a research group recently created.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would cease to file legal proceedings for minor misdemeanours for possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to file charges against such crimes - with immediate effect -
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face positions of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other positions.
\"Our office has an obligation to take legal action against those shortcomings that were committed at the time they were a crime,\" Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any outstanding cases by possession.
\"I don't think he's wasting his time on enforcing the law until it changes,\" he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use to the government and the judicial system was easy.
The conflicting reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalentness among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the marijuana Act.
\"They have spent so much time taking people to the courts that, in fact, they still can't accept it to be legal,\" he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at the national level with regard to the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border on legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still envisages the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite the fact that some prominent arrests of marijuana patients and sellers have taken place for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has enabled most of them to have marijuana sales for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
\"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to take down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow the operation of state-controlled stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law,\" said Kevin A. Sabet, a drug policy exagger from Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will last about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely that it will be approved next week.
\"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,\" said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against in favour of what the state voted for -
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: \"They bullied me to Oxford for being a Tory\"
You don't attack college students from your point of view just now.
I don't remember a moment in my life when I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, when I was two weeks away from taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father fell down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate that some college colleagues had sexual relations in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that he had left me because they forced me to drink in unplugged cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
They harassed me for a single reason, which at the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that is now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-center students is experiencing similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred towards students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are, often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful people, for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the equal opportunities committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called \"Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right\" (Paradise: young, bright and right-wing) about student politics and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, polishing a silver suit and a stick with silver grip.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as \"Turkish leaders\" by introducing higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, states that this environment is \"uncomfortable\" while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill and president-elect of OUCA states that the attitude of the JCR members towards the people who are right centred has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
For my first few weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, and she was a terriblely shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The year before, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title - honororis cause - after cuts in the financing of higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist startled startling.
Already during the first days of the week welcome to the new college students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I was expecting.
I discovered that not only did the professors look fat in the face of the mockery of conservative college students, but they were willingly participating in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, the privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts into English from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
\"Mr. Wyatt,\" said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), \"please translate the first paragraph.\"
Don't say one.
Pitt, a bajito man with a face that looked like a bizcocho mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
\"It's that the thatcherists refuse to learn French, or that they're just fools,\" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears he was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room as a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
\"I know who you are,\" he said kindly.
- I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborists -
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to dissimulate.
I insisted that you did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out useless.
A first-year student from Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated.
Other students adopted that song.
I became the perverted dirt.
\"How do the Tories have sex?\" asked one.
\"They beat each other, don't they?\"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after last night?
Do I have to become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expected to be presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
\"Here you're not going to be happy,\" he said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends with more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
You didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
\"But if it's the best place in the world,\" he said sadly.
They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude -
His painful eyes began to cloud.
Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you'd let it go.
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his belief.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had insinuated, fully speaking seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people” I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admit that my parents had -washed my brain - and I called them - stupid old people -
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in a fit of fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but is now hidden behind a reputation that is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
‘Valentin prefers elegance to notoriety’
On the occasion of the exhibition \"Valentino: Master of the Costura\" which was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of \"Valentino: Maestro de la Costura\", a retrospective apotheotic that brings together more than 130 high-sewn dresses created by its \"house\" over the past 50 years.
\"I love this palace,\" he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the collophon of a story whose only protagonist is Mr Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the angry and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3rd of March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from humble modisto of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international \"jet-set\".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off the collars of their beehives on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains with generosity and elegance.
We all loved to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad - explains the ex-wife of Heini - Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
“Every guest made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model” which began working with him during the High Cost Week in Paris in 1995.
\"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art\" ends.
Alcurial parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions, but of well-matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a dreamy audience that shines Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dresser who used Monica Vitti in -La Notte - or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of manikins, such as the name of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modest, in 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love - impossible to forget -
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest, and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
\"It was a gift that he made me,\" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
\"I prefer it to him above others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he enhances our beauty,\" adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they're -- they're giving -- to your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she saw a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to be old and the occasion to be able to wear one of their night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to use at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Linen.
It was a red suit, with skirts of flys, \"corsage\" drapes and echoes word of honor.
\"It was a dream come true,\" says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
\"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, its obsession is the timeless one,\" explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modestist party dresses with the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries out -
He dreams and fashions
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume with Pablo of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25-girlfriends (as the modist calls their seams) to develop that ivory silk suit with pearl incrustings, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-metre tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone in the high seas of the late 20th century, - the return of high-society customers -
Retired for years with the \"avoir-être\" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
\"It has always drawn my attention to its refinement, its calmness, its pure and perfect appearance,\" says D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table at the countess Jacqueline in Ribes, a great friend of mine.
\"It was impeccable, time does not pass for him\"
If a princess says so...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom your work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by taking sulphur out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the earth’s bowels solidifies when getting in touch with the air.
After removing large sulphur rocks, which in total reach about 70 kilos, carry them in two bamboo baskets that carry over their shoulders through rugged stone paths.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend through the turtle, keeping the balance and measuring with tendon their steps so as not to slip and fall through the precipice.
They know that any transpire could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off for the risks of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur they extract
Once above, the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulphur.
Then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture rings, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
As normal is to charge 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip - explains Anto, who usually takes three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends soft, but allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery to such an inhumane effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (267 euros),” the carrier clarified, who previously worked as a masonry in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulphur: \"I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam\"
Then he has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by the toxic gases
At the age of 27, Etto takes three toying in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
\"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,\" he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist from a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unusual wooden hut with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop manding at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, he goes down to the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs nor provides any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and on their own weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of charge per camera which, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
\"This job is for the beasts and not for the people,\" protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Ability to raise up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will endure working - whatever he can - because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulphur burns the throat and squeezes the eyes when the wind changes unexpectedly and traps miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... beyond, of course, it is, of its usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sore throats in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only charge 50 pounds to his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks move to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the weeds.
\"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,\" Unainik proclaims, opening her mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, he also works with sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates generation-to-generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
-The population of Singapore needs to grow -
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we're fulfilling our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem unbelievable that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as - Let's put a bao (ball) in the oven - to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they can draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their national duty.
This is purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we make it as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spend $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as the replenishment rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a \"best education\" and \"a wider range of career opportunities\"
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aims at dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticize for maintaining low wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoe box, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says their shoe boxes, are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out of days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for the developers, who were previously put in a trap if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre that are not going to have much effect.
\"People are very stressed, homes are expensive and education is also expensive, so many people are procrastinating it,\" says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
\"But for me it's important to have my own money and time,\" says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress, and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off-line is private on-line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private or private life that is entitled to protect from any interference.
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your everyday life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers that you are exposed to by ventilating situations on the Internet that you would probably not share out of line?
the Periodical interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with - something very my - on the personal level, and - on the key and user name - when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets would not go up to a post,” Jorge says, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding accounts for two years.
\"They're very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not everyone,\" she says.
In FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I also enjoy myself with my acquaintances.
\"I wouldn't share a picture other than mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous thing,\" he says.
The child recognizes that he or she is mispublishing obscene photographs of naked people, of crimes, or writing humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
\"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just going up them,\" he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
I have no doubt that I would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
\"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,\" he says.
According to the boy, no one insinuated him or asked him to address his home or his phone number.
“If I was pressured or simply demanded by the bags of my account,” she admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
\"I never knew who he was,\" he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
\"Only gave them privacy.\"
Then explain a series of steps to securely set up the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would take pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I get hurt or I'm hungry.
\"Though I know that's cyberbullying,\" he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
\"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed,\" he mentions.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, master of Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
\"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning,\" he says.
He says that the issue is complex, because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disseminated, published or said to an age that maturity does not give for that.
\"Even if they are selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,\" he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
\"Tell them not to do it does not work,\" he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like me to post a picture of you like you published by a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
It's the same rules.
\"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and it must be equally on social networks,\" he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary teacher and an educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read social media policies to be aware of.
By understanding each of the entries they have solid grounds for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
\"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,\" he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children of the lesson of “do not talk to strangers”
Finalize Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically endorsed by the seven assistant representatives.
He repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Ministry and Presidency indicated at an early stage that they were to deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be posted on the Peruvian Government's website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Access by journalists to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the unsound video of the presidential assembly with the message - private session, restricted audio - was transmitted in the press room.
The little information that was circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that requested more data.
Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the final statement of the summit, but it was the pronouncement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite its insistence on the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which had previously been announced, was not published.
On the official ASPA website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but they limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Hague Court that would lead to a border dispute between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional appointment and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today,” Humala said, along with her Chilean couple.
“Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Piñera added, and welcomed Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that the ICJ will be submitted occurred after Colombia denounced the Bogota Pact this week for which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the in attendance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the noon of Lima.
The representative read the final document stating that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will make important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements.
He reported that actions are being taken to improve - cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently -
With a Europe in crisis, - economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our peoples - Humala added.
\"We have decided to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits,\" said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate the Union of South American Nations from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional appointment that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
\"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,\" Santos said.
\"We're going to review all these ways, they're not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua,\" he stressed.
\"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible,\" Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the defense ministers of the block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen the defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the time being of the regional bloc.
‘South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship’: Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which - South America, in this case, must learn from Europe -
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the State TV Peru that Europeans - killed themselves in World War II - and in other conflicts - are now virtually a country -
He defended, in that regard, the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the Unasur member countries.
\"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,\" he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed his support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José covenant on human rights.
Those who hold the chair never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States,” said Ecuador’s founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, in reference to political asylum.
Correa said that she is not sorry for that decision because she has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its \"deep democratic and human rights values\"
He added that, at the time, \"there were grounded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that its process was not respected\"
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice for demanding that an interrogation be carried out on his territory for a alleged sexual offence when — Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London —
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
\"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,\" said the Ecuadorian representative.
What is there is a danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are confined in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeline allowing it to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the siege of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón is making a series of procedures at different European institutions,” he mentioned.
And he thought that if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over -
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took advantage of reaffirming herself as a defender of freedom of the press, and realized that what does not tolerate is mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which distort freedom of expression.
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not wicked and perverse politicians but bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, it was welcomed that it was no longer these journalists - neither the bankers nor the Hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador - and he said that if he was re-elected, he would go further into the revolution to continue the path and the right direction -
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency - must be firm and must not tolerate opportunism and lopism clothed with legality - because in reality - destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy -
The Ecuadorian president also considered, \"Perfectly relevant\" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, that failure is not taken into account.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute held at the same Peru and Chile tribunal and felt that - it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to accept harsh judgements as it is -
Referring to the eventuality that is presented as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility - with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard -
Correa claimed that if she loses her February 2013 bills, she will withdraw from public life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
\"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsiveness,\" he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
\"It's a decision,\" he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just spoken with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, on a routine basis, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
\"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health,\" he said.
The head of Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the test result: positive AIDS.
\"It was as if I dropped a bomb,\" he said, \"remembering the timing of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make \"more soft\" without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to whom he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him, because he brought a cut.
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, - exhausted - their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, - the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same - indicated the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment to the immune system that patients have when they start the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years old with a 200 CD4 and 50 years old, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that the person who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms, as long as he remains in control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age, explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I see it, so it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had a drug shortage the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a powerful fact: “Nine out of every ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer evidence of detection in a massive way, to all those who require it.”
In their proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to test a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his early age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
\"If I'm going to die, I'd better come back three times a week,\" they say no to me.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I do exercise, I take the medicines.
By now, your parents only know that you have cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
\"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponding, I care for myself and the other person,\" Fabrizio listed, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that in the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, your message, summarizes the battle slogan to AIDS this 2012.
Condones behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a covert journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, the condom distribution has been increased, before we were given one or two, now they give us packages of 100, and that's fine but it turns out that there are those who still have no access to a condom today,\" he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“For what you want it is a common question, with sorority and value judgments from social workers, school mentors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents are not wanted to be exposed, the communicator assured.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; let condoms not only be behind the display and these hundred are found in public bathers at the sites that frequent young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It's not about paying them the cherries and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be condoms in his administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 reported cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th of HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for a recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario places a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backyard to the ruling issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankrupt Court for the North Texas district, leaves defenseless to Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties on the border of the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
On entry, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would imply not being aware of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was established to that end, with the American Law Institute as its arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the inter-companies vote, recognised in the critical mass of the trade contest the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies debts endorsed the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The fact is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the funds (buitre) such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 under the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, taking the collection to the country.
The signing of the Gonzalez Sada family will soon bring an appeal for reconsideration to the appeal court for the vote to reach its full, that is, the five judges, since they have only voted three.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare's appeal will be sought which requires the review of the case by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The seriousness of the case is that the court held a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicius curiae, a friend of the Court, detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that it disbanded with respect to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has acceded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded candy: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
For several months the complaints put on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-dune, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Flying Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The case led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, who is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for Dragon Mars.
Gathered on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal center for sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a lime house area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had succeeded in uniting the governors of the south-east area to oppose the monumental thing that had devastated part of protected areas and posed the mother of all the amazons against the industry.
ACTA Died
Under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, known for its English acronyms, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, has signed by the government a requirement of the Senate.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor-Hetin-Reyes: \"The basketball has been my life\"
Trotamundos of the Héctor-Hetin-Reyes basketball was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the stool and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor-Hetin-Reyes has.
And it's just that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a player of minor categories, a player of the National Upper Baloncest, taken over and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueurs or president of the Federation of Baloncesto.
\"I put many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s,\" Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
\"The basketball has been my life\"
Reyes doesn't overdo that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his broad trajectory, so testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who commemorate their passage through the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age acting as co-powered or taken over by the franchise.
\"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, either as a taker, co-powered or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy at the BSN.
From then on, he took over \"Cuco-Ortiz, who was a great administrator,\" said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: \"I have you a very strong player, 6-7 - of stature.
Do you want it?
And that was Mincy's beginning, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gauss would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros' championship with Gauss enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already a federative warrant.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Preolimpic in Mexico 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth and must have been bronzed not by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that World Group of 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it one for the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and -Piculín - (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) - Toñito - Colon and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario -Quijote - Morales, who had not been able to be in 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players such as -Canito - Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the Panamerican auction of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered at that level as Piculin did.
And that's not to mention his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Right now the children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the result of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as \"J.R.\", in the television series \"Dallas\" in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil-magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series \"Dallas\", became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of \"Dallas\", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer house of \"Dallas\"
\"Larry was back in her beloved home town of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role she liked most,\" said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found to be a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before -Dallas - Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy -I Dream of Jeannie - broadcasted by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
She played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, portrayed by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short of time in the air, \"The Good Life\" (NBC, 1971-72) and \"Here We Go Again\" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included papers well received by the criticism in -The Group - -Harry and Tonto - and -Primary Colors -
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led to Hagman's greatest starry.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase - Who shot J.R. -, intended to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling homes.
It also helped give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and converted to \"Dallas\" in the second most popular entertainment program in history, behind the end of \"MASH\" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. embarrassed her and then threatened her with being a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
\"I know what I want in J.R.'s tombstone,\" Hagman said in 1988.
You should say: \"Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing\"
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Victoria Principal, the co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone -- enormous, inside and outside the screen --
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of \"Dallas\" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in progress, reported the chain.
Soon there was no statement by Warner or TNT about how Hagman's loss will be handled.
Rising from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as \"South Pacific\" and \"Peter Pan\"
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He proved lucky at the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs \"Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life\"
\"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in some way,\" he said to the Associated Press at that time.
After liver transplantation became the promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the fearful patients.
\"I advise them, I value them, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then,\" he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like -- they don't fear, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but they'll be fine --
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Courses begin to explore the “End of the World”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the \"long countdown\" of the Maya Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been held as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was expected of him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called \"deudarmedon\" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
\"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,\" Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the end of the world this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course - Media, Culture and the End of the World -
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
\"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,\" he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to undertake a course, entitled only - The end of the world -
\"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end,\" Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin” students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves the students no choice but to work - until the same night that the world is supposed to end - Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said about her course for high-average students, who was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if it was still taking place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing career, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
\"I had never heard of a class that could teach that,\" he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiration date of 21 December.
\"Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy and in a way discredited it,\" said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, aged 21, and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“On other sides people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about some course on the \"end of the world\" there.
\"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,\" he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, people will begin to think immediately on the next date, or to philosophize that on 21 December it is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're thinking of going to parties - from the end of the world -
\"Maybe I'll call some friends for us to laugh together,\" said 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
