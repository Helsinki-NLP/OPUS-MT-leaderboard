Members of the Assembly of Wales fear - passing through Marretas -
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to - Welsh Parliament -
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, are afraid that this will make them look ridiculous.
A Labour AM stated that the group is concerned about the appointment to remain with Twp and Pwp -
For non- Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, ‘twp’ means ‘idiota’ and pwp means ‘excrements’
An AM from Plaid stated that the group in its globality - was not happy - and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Welsh Member said that the group was open-minded in relation to the name change, but said that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The House Committee, currently drawing up legislation to introduce the name amendments, stated: \"The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves.\"
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AM title, the Commission favoured either - Members of the Welsh Parliament - or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together may constitute a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the House carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AM and the configuration of the commission system.
When discussing legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decade conflict with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint on its territory, repeatedly objecting to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the plebiscite's opponent on the change of name, stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
Sinos de St. Martin are silent at a time when the Harlem churches fight for survival
\"In a historical perspective, the elderly who I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner,\" said Mr. Adams.
\"Today, there is neither one nor the other\"
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
\"People socialize differently,\" I said today.
\"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are regularly headed.\"
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned about the eventuality of the money earned with the sale of wealth not to last as long as the leaders expect - and that, sooner or later, everything will return to exactly the starting point -
The churches, he added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condos inhabited by the type of people who will not support the shrines of the neighborhood that still remain.
\"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,\" he said, \"and so, this will speed up the arrival of the day these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations.\"
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later set up by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street shopkeepers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made the plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the freighter - the bells of the poor -
The specialist who touched the coach in July called him something else: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
This expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first rail in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest rail in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it \"would seek to pass on the costs to it\" bad grade the fact that it was not involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes injuries in 13-year-olds in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as the boy heard screaming for help, then rowing in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just a matter of enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but then it was noticed that the boy was screaming, \"I was bitten!\"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the clavicle was torn apart, described Hammel what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I called everyone out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard Captain Larry Giles stated in a press release that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of the large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to win quota in the UK cosmetics market, assessed at £ 2.8 billion, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and articles for home withdraw, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested at 11 stores scattered throughout the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand from supermarkets for ways to use exposure space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oréal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those from stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, will open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing eating habits for small daily quantities in nearby shops have led to supermarkets now having to make more efforts to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stated that stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, also having installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has strengthened sales of merchandise products and made purchases more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's has sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops a wide range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetic sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways to make purchases -
Peter Jones - angry - after Holly Willoughby left 11 million pound business
Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, became \"furious\" after TV host Holly Willoughby left a 11 million pound deal with his Lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the brand of items for the Truly home and accessories.
The deal of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons star Den Peter Jones livid by abandoning the lucrative brand in the last minute to concentrate on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became - angry - when the gold girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at her corporate empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (whose value can amount to £1.5 million) meant that she would no longer have time to dedicate to her brand of home items and Truly accessories.
The deal was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrow and it was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave Truly, Jones was picking up a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source stated: “Truly was by far the largest of Holly’s priorities.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left all absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of items ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow -
The experts believe that the departure of this Morning's presenter, who is among the most lucrative celebrities in Britain, may cost the company millions, given the huge investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household articles, and the potential for further delays in the launch.
Besides, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
The couples take a vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program from ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night that \"We don't intend to comment on your business\"
Hard talk and then we'll get in touch with each other.
The American President jokingly mentioned the criticisms that he would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider - unworthy of a president - and for revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump yield so much?
Trump said, in his feigned voice of \"television desk\"
\"I didn't give in at all.\"
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, pointing out that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearisation are drifting.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a \"responding response\" from the US to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the beginning.
\"It's running very well with North Korea,\" he said.
We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship -
Trump stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the deadly remnants of U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this supercrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island causing the death of hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid channelling.
\"Unfortunately, it has been clear, in many cases, that they are not asking for international aid; therefore, it becomes a little difficult,\" said Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to address Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant tremors of land suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, poor degree the existence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made the improvement of the infrastructure decrepit a central part of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the funding shortage has overwhelmed the executive of Mr Joko, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim bands fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the drawhead against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's beacon, with his team losing for 1-0.
He tapped his left before making a finish towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell over a flight Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think too much about the thing. I just finished.\"
Chelsea won by 1-0 at the interval after setting a goal at the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this move, the advanced blues gave a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before disbanding near the middle field and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick half-field pass.
Then he made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
This overstepped the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second beam with a finish with the left foot that passed the guard Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday, at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videoton at the UEFA Europe League on the third of Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rise to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared at the beginning of Sunday the country's disaster response agency.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspected murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with sharp gun wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
The police urged the population of the area that might have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious that they were contacting us.
I would also like to appeal to those who may have obtained images with tablier cameras, particularly taxi drivers, who contact us, because they may have crucial information for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the site of the occurrence to inquire about the place where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police have reported that they are currently informing relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed about what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they can only return to their homes within hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly claims that - it's so awful -
At 2 p.m., two police vans were within the cord and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A series of police officers were highlighted inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information to contact with DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via number 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed by the battle of historical revisionism.
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls that perpetrated by the Taliban, by so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and that it was carried out by its fanatic puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as \"a madness\" and \"an attempt to rewrite history\"
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure at Westminster Palace would become a target for slaughter.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and on the part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe is worthy of homage.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate description is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration -
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name (Yuan) was found dead, with a cut and blood-covered artery, close to a market spot in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read in the South China Morning Post of Sunday.
The suinculator prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farming on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with the cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, your cousin found him dead and discovered a door for an open neighbor's pocilla.
In that pocilla, I said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilos, had attacked the pig to death, according to the report.
\"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed,\" said the cousin, mentioned by his nickname \"Wu,\" according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Your body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Eveing News that the pig had been shut down to prevent him from attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the scene of the occurrence.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have already been reported to human beings.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with severe injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as \"stimulus\"
They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We only need to show them due respect, he said.
Hurricane remnants Rosa should bring heavy rain widespread to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwestern America in the next few days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time Sunday, the Rosa caused cracks of 137 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a depression over the Pacific Ocean that moves to the western coast of the US. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will start pushing a strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern area of the US.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the surrounding depression will produce heavy rains widespread in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden dangerous floods, ravaged by debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5-7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation is expected in southwest areas, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with the conditions in rapid aggravation due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can cause the ravines to turn into raging rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong pointed winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the southern California coastal line.
Total rainfalls of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause small spells of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
There will be some tropical rain showers scattered in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the territory of the US as the Arctic cools. However, the tropical zones will remain quite threatening.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and extend again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. area will record a hot start in October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our weather forecast for the long term indicates a high probability of the occurrence of temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. area by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended yesterday in six television stations the rapist testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drawn up by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh beat her as drunk and tried to throw her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as determined by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of spectators in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations which transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring hearings from those who see programs in offices.
To give some insight, it is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the audience that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then came to CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he was trying to enter an elevator to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained still looking at the floor while he was criticized directly for CNN cameras.
\"I'm here in front of you,\" said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It has been told to you that - you have power while so many women have no power -
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that he would have to say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct order hours later, when the Judicial Commission was in favour of making the appointment of Kavanaugh to proceed for a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake stated that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, something the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with her friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later, with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"making politics\" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to leave the European Union of “politicidity” with the future of Britain and to harm the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the \"Chequers Plan\" of the Minister for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Great Britain and the EU cover the other side's tariffs is - absolutely absurd -
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player Death · Global Voices
The police arrested a suspect of Sims' deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to communication from Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police claimed that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson DNA in them, reports to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A bail of USD 350 000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The legal office of the East Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal laboratory, Southern University Police and area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their \"diligence and effort to get justice\"
Sims was 20.
This advanced, 198 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 stakes per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was \"stricken\" and \"in shock\" for Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries us at all times,” Wade said.
Vulcan casts ash in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Catastrophe Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists recorded an increase in the volcano activity, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook Mexico's central area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Confronts between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, caught by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw paint into dust, creating dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups that sang - we did not forget, we did not forgive - faced unionist demonstrators who shouted - Long life for Spain -
Fourteen people were treated with minor injuries suffered during the protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose overwhelming independence, although the turnout to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote on polls scattered throughout the region, which resulted in violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was performed, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
- Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked - he said.
Despite having gained a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties in keeping the momentum this year, with their leaders best known in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
\"It's getting more and more tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been waiting for trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the next year's elections.
“Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car fight against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone might also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, amazed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as an Ibrox club technician.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes level, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face the Rapid Vienna home at the Europe League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended to six games his succession of defeatless confrontations in the division, with the main coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against stunned visitors
Holt's team should have advanced in the score long before the goal, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself crawl in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort away after he squirmed to find Craig Halkett's head over the beacon.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that she could cause trouble to visitors in the stop ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston obtained an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and the Liam Kelly network guard had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a turn away from another Livingston stop ball move.
Crossings continued to occur for the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were refused by the referee.
Livingston - phenomenal - - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and the staff have changed little since their return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, getting an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving her their best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was far short of these standards.
Their final move was uninspired (only once they managed to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new, gigantic mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked a presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also been heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of the Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15, British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a relief team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in an escape collision on Childers Street, about one and a half kilometres from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police stated that the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in Disorders
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, said the Prison Office.
The disturbances, which still continue, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m., British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents have been called back to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a wing.
Agents were treated with small facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services stated: \"Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, last October, agents of the intervention police were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is expected for the beginning of the next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Desert Southwest, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for the southern and eastern areas of Nevada, for southern California and for Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will assume a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rains.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border -
The latest models of the National Furacão Center provide for 5 to 10 mm precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin can receive 3 to 5 mm, with possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rosa may constitute a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category - reported the siteweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass crossing the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
Heavy precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfalls of 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora are expected, with maximums of 25 mm,” reported the siteweather.com.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger of the Rosa or its resquisites is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the South-West Desert of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and ravaged floods of debris in the deserts, with risk of life, and floods in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with cutting gun wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4h00, British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains - stable -
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in Radstock Area were arrested during the night, and he informed Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have appealed to everyone who can have mobile phone footage of their success.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh - was the victim of malice and anger - of the Democratic Party
\"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implacable and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was the victim of malice and anger in the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that - the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
\"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,\" he said to the many supporters of West Virginia.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of republican influx to the polls in the mid-term elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running - he said.
\"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates\"
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a principal deputy of the leadership of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged along by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, they informed the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high they fought on the beach at sunset, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the success,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho declared, the agency’s spokesman to minimize the effect of the Indonesian catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jacarta.
“The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted bridges and downhills, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the huge abalone on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the declaration.
Nugroho described the damage as \"extensive\" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims imprisoned under the rubble of the buildings were found downstairs, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage may be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications - they were totally incapacitated and there was no information - about Donggala, he said Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the area - the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,\" he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities have stated that the waves emerged at the time the notice was issued.
In an amateur video released on social media, a man can be seen on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell down on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut in energy that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to the Palau evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia grows exponentially to over 800.
It's too bad.
Although he managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the people of the World Vision of Donggala went through devastating scenes on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
\"They told me they saw many houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's too bad.
Even when the aid groups began to start the grim assistance tasks to the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign staff may have access to the premises only if it is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe,\" said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
-What the government says -OK, this is a national catastrophe - we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist -
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing kept hope that their loved ones would become part of the miracles that attenuate the grim headlines of natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours after the news of the breakup of Hotel Roa Roa had begun to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages at WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
\"I think that means that the messages were not delivered,\" he said.
Thieves carry 26 750 USD during automatic cash refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an automatic box in the diversion complex and preparing to enter more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man came up running behind Brink's official and stole a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, please contact the Newport Police through the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames you to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name - to Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being previously known to Kanye West”
West, 41 years old, received some time ago the nickname Ye and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in the Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for emotional reasons - the creator of the show reported.
At the same time being an abbreviation for his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
\"I believe that \"ye\" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means \"you,\" said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album to the radio presenter Big Boy.
-So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means - the only - to just Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are -
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military personnel against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed to not using the military force against civilians, at a time when the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza - never use the army to suppress the Mexican people -
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador undertook to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The President said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research spending in this area, said the investor and professional of the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements related to AI, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy in this area.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since all the other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in AI,” said Lee.
Duplicate funding may double the chances of the next major success of AI being achieved by the United States, said Lee to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an AI system that defeated the best-rated American player of Othello. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous U.S. government technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
\"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies,\" he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaires to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies can also help the US to give impetus to its efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that green cards should automatically be granted to doctors in AI,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences makes funding available to people in academic institutions in a way similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been advancing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change in the country's name to -Republic of North Macedonia - an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour to the north represents a complaint about its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout to the polls will be sufficient to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was as follows: ‘It is in favour of the entry into NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece —
Supporters of the change of name, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
\"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,\" said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there were no records of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters appeared to vote.
\"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Gjoose Tanevski, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's prime minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the name of the country, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and to the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who will boycott the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up and not the service door,\" Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration —
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
\"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a \"yes\" would be the \"confirmation of our future\"
A survey published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary influx.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disappointment in pro-Western government policy since it took possession of last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy at your goal in minute 65.
The Argentinean advanced received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before he cut to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralising in the race plus others within the great Brighton area.
So you made a pass to your left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used its first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's network guard with a finish on the right side of the network.
“Aguero is debating with some foot problems,” said Pep Guardiola, City coach.
We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the confrontation of the Premier League.
That goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in this play.
He walked over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This one gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues advance kicked the ball into the network immediately before sliding out of the field boundaries.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but still intend to secure their title from the first division.
Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Because I wouldn't want to compete in those conditions.
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would perform his 34th beginning, held a session on the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right player goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 shootouts at 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump conducts rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influx in the mid-term elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates - he said.
Trump went on, \"They see this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they see it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they're angry with, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them --
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of \"resisting and obstructing\"
\"And they saw this in the last four days,\" he said, \"aggressive, evil, deaf and lying\" to the Democrats.
The President referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, and received a sound voice from the public.
- Remember your answer?
Have you caused the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I, wait, um - that was an even bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local partisan organization voted to censure me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
In the end, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in the Joan Ryan parliament has been treated in a similar way because she has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar themes for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Labour Meeting of Nottingham East on Friday mentioned that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of politics - kinder and kinder - was long forgotten, if it has ever been fulfilled.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by party leadership.
This started a short time after Jeremy took the lead, because those colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me a revolution and to take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public (and I don't really care what I say), there are a lot of insults on social media that appeal to the \"decommissioning\" by denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never go back to them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the way these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer be inclusive, and with each motion of “censorship” or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the last two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that would - it would be all right - for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left the classroom of my school literally comprehensive in rubble, I tried to fight for better public services for those they need most, either as a coach or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policies, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have become somehow confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of \"dejection\" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent out the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeat.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
\"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,\" he said.
Robyn Christie do Melrose said: \"The merit goes to the Ayr. They managed the risks better than we -
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, granted to the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the half-time, having marked and then converted a solo test to place the marker on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the beginning, Ayr reinforced the leadership with a study of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The Ayr captain in charge, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted Bruce Colvine trial at the end of an intense pressure-investment.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for overthrowing Climo without the ball, in the penalty release, MacPherson put the ball on the floor behind the maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, Still Game star, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and participates with the long-standing comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, to be released soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the \"florescent business of Glasgow restoration\"
The sea is ours: Bolivia, a landless country, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The seabeds from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas bear the motto: \"The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty -
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a sentence from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the outcome - Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat said.
Many Bolivians will see the delivery of the TIJ sentence on giant screens scattered throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favour of the complaint of their country, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has much at stake in the Monday sentence.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean\" were the president's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That TIJ's sentence should be rendered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case - it was not complicated - referred to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed her.
“The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the dialogue after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
The next Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile, and a possibility of ending 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
Bolivia will never dispense with its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
\"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past\"
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country relying on the US
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho stated that his nation will never dispense with its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy at an impasse, more than three months after Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that this is an impossible dream to consider that the continuing sanctions and the US' objection to a declaration that puts a final point in the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking any significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang actually intending to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a shop near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which made the set style startled in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad aba similar to a feather that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included curded jewels, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high sewing.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to give continuity to this huge statement of fashion, you're lucky.
Watchers of stylism predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of the -La Bomba - the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation to the walkers: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swim model that carried it.
The rafia bag in burned orange color, adorned with raffia fringes and with a white leather collar, was the most outstanding piece of the spring-summer La Riviera 2019 collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m waiting to see big hats and beach bags get to the shops for the next summer. Once the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language competences are essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30 000 students spread throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we talk to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.
This quote reminds us that we cannot only rely on English when we want to create relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
This data, collected from the 74 schools at the height of the SCIS, showed that 72% of the students obtained the maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital competences that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Competences Commission in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employers in filling vacancies, 17% concerned the lack of language skills.
Knowing other languages is therefore increasingly an imperative for preparing the younger generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, the French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today's children.
The field of various languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with a better chance of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in-house schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a teaching environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for fans who intend to see LeBron James start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Laker coach, announced that James will participate in the Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell published a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six game schedule of the Lakers in the pre-season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
YouTube Time and Channel of Trump's Beginning in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five events scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformation waiting for his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen support for the mid-term elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to see him online?
Trump's Wheeling rally in West Virginia is marked for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to attend Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below on a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's vote of confirmation will be on hold for a week while the FBI proceeds to investigate.
However, the main objective of this series of events is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to win some momentum.
Thus, those responsible for President Trump's campaign had stated that these five meetings next week were intended to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority that they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitation of the campaign season,” said a spokesman for Trump’s campaign who refused to be quoted, Reuters told him.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the beginning of the night will attract supporters from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area - according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in polls.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a hand in the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates that they have strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon forsomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the momentum is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is coming now?
\"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're looking at it as a little bit of momentum,\" Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving the camp at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, at the advantage of four points ahead and with more than twelve at stake.
Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some spare energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those shrieks of celebration were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match in the 15th produced a similar cry, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, has four in four and cannot fail.
The-Moliwood was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning's back.
In this series, and given the way your energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players hitting on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European victory to the sun in the Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero this morning, when on a team with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine shoved the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played a better team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted that it has.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after having left the fourballs and forsomes of the Saturday matches with a leadership of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty reaching the classification at Le Golf National, so far, with four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a successful American team in the morning's fourballs, winning the 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winning matches, but they couldn't shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received the nickname of \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but already lost 19 of the games he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning furballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze to the southwest of Paris, Europe has not always taken the best.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did a team invest a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, the title holder, only need to tie up to keep the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says not to think of a unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating the distrust of the United States and that there was no unilateral way for the country to dispense with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken - significant good-will measures - last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the non-proliferation commitment of nuclear weapons and technologies.
\"However, we do not see any corresponding US response,\" he said.
- Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our disarmament first -
Although Ri has recycled already-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to an approach - phased - to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-steps, its statements appear to be significant as they do not slightly reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with Pyongyang's earlier positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit held between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim undertook to work towards \"the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang first has to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists on first denuclearization and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, opposing until the declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust -
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three encounters between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: \"If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.\"
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from that of last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding the North Korean rockets towards the US territory was inevitable after Mr. President Mau-Trump had called Kim \"the rocket man\" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened - completely destroyed - North Korea, filled Kim with praise for its courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much had yet to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have a timetable for this, stating that if it took two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously until denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable”
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States - taking corresponding measures -
Pompey stated that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest long enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all of its students to sleep more, an initiative to combat the machist culture of studying in -directes - impregnated with caffeine.
One teacher concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking had often not the least idea about the most basic concepts of care that they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes he is the first of his kind in the US.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
\"In the end, a girl came to me and said, \"Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?\"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me - she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know it won't change the students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking option - added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in - making direct - still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we have slept enough and with quality should be a \"secret weapon\" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a way of hunger, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian physical and chemical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put the use of an alarm for bedtime, as to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of \"blue light\" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulation the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: goal of Menga brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad access outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to defeat 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team was trying to record his first victory on his route from the 1-0 triumph in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and Rangers' collective, uninspired of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now coming down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for the difference of greedy.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence prosecutor received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that exceeded Ayr in the end socks of Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and would have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team smothered the opponents in each move.
Rangers may have mastered ball ownership, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have dialed at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average wasted his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett's meeting, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish out towards the second beam.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he should have been granted a great penalty to the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeals.
The Rangers only got two rounds at the beacon in the first part, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly network guard had little to worry about the head end of Lassana Coulibaly and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal of Livingston at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, the more it is not because of its tenacity.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a long-stop ball game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had immediate impact when the advanced side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to perform the blockade.
However, Livingston has continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor did well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ended up out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he got entangled in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Almanac-Sunday Morning: On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years ago and continues to CONTAR ...in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ended up leading to the device known as Geiger counter.
Fundamentals of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado\" in which unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: - What the hell is that -
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as an uranium.
When we put these headphones, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals -
Evans: -Look, now it's really cracking -
\"Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave the name still endures.

A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to -ver - harmful cells and to kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can - see - a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can -see - a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: \"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2 - controls the growth of various types of cancer - including breast, ovarian, lung and also colorectal ones, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from the patients and -- teaching them -- attacking cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supported diatribe carrying a MAGA hat after its appearance at the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, stating that he would apply for the presidential elections in 2020.
After executing his song of the night, with the name Ghost Town, in which he carried out a hat-Make America Great, he started a bravata against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"So many times I talk to a white man and he tells me, \"How can you like Trump? He's a racist.\"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have abandoned America a long time ago - I said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star smashed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the scene of West's bravata was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to crack West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bit of time behind the scenes on account of the hat.
- They put me in the backrest.
They said, \"Don't go there with that hat.\"
They set me up!
And then they tell me I'm marginalised - he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"They want to see marginalization,\" saying that \"it would put my superman layer, because that means nobody tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.
His comments led to public goings and the participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, told Variety, having someone from the program said to the newspaper: \"The whole studio was completely silent\"
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of the song I Love it disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: “One of our bravest spirits: RELIGED BY ENFRENTING THE TURBA”
However, interview programme presenter Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply - to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful -
\"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or supporting his \"art\" - that I believe I am welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so did we - he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now - to be previously known by Kanye West -
West is not the first to change his name, following Diddy's pasts, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has also used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince has changed its name to a symbol and then to -the artist previously known as Prince -

The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Throne Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as an engrimist as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, Throne War.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the machist hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys often feel they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit reported that he believes that - something went wrong - and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Throne War, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a very strong position on the problem.
\"I have a very strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity,\" he said.
\"What we've been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now\"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on: \"What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I believe this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went too bad for young people -
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequelas or sequelae of the Thrones War when the series ended next summer, referring that, for him, the \"camps of battle and horses\" ended.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
\"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on,\" she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters unfortunately leaks information about Republican senators by one of his collaborators and attacks the \"dangerous minds\" and \"conspiracy theories\"
US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and websites of the -ultra-right -
“Further lies, lies and more contemptible lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses of the households and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on accusations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
\"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,\" Waters continued.
My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this information leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie -
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
\"This disbeliever is angry,\" Fleischer wrote.
That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something that isn't their responsibility, they can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging stance.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You must reveal calmness and serenity -
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will be competing for Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
\"Very serious if it's true,\" read his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted the competent authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
\"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed,\" he continued, \"and they will be legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff\"
Johnny criticism English Back to Attack - weak spying film parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connots with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with \"Johnny English\" and brought back to life in 2011 with \"The Return of Johnny English\"
Ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes scratched and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comical creation destined for non-angophone cinephiles.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a little Cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film \"Moments of Glory\" in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter carrying a medieval armor, with the rotor's shovels making a short noise of coaching against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that film editions - serious - such as the 007 and the Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is directed to children and not adults and, in my opinion, the bizarre misadventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to dismay the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total dwindling of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds Theresa May's character, but the argument doesn't give much material for great flights.
Your secret service advisors inform you that since all the agents in the asset have been committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the undistracted Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a chic school, but giving non-official classes on how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the film - Rock School -
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again to his suffering assistant Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, an elusive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe at His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic billionaire of technologies that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd defiant acts: disguised as employees of the table, lit up a bona fide French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating as clandestines in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggers pure anarchy as it tries to use glasses of virtual reality to familiarize itself with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however nice and tempestuous it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is fairly median.
And as in the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't stop asking: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers complain that they are creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be pondering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, granting them an additional day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the orderly.
Sources indicate that the idea - would be adjusted - to the economic programme of the party, which reorients the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We hope to announce a review of policies before the end of the year.
\"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adapted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for the worker, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector\"
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favoured by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party said: \"The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it.\"
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from the hands of the \"faceless directors\" and the \"speculators\" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the full share of the current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party can carry out - deductions - on the basis of the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers on the board of directors of the company and create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may pay dividends that may amount to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the [60 Minutes] whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them or not change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the findings may lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy showed himself but open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" Kennedy said.
I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim appeared, and I asked him, \"Did you do it?\"
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal -
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
\"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett did a vigorous disclaimer,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new to change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Redeuvred, not only to attend activities such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or -actions - such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a telephone call or any other significant forms that contribute to raising awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen over the past 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of ‘clickivism’ - do we think it makes any difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million actions of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion in respect of them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and implementers committed to - helping children reach their full potential - which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after having received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote from history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom in order to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, -What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty -
Global Citizen responds: \"It was a long and tortuous way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use the navy as a \"blocker\" to place an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
-If necessary - Washington can turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where the legitimate government's invitation comes, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is to try to broker energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,\" he said.
And according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
‘The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market,’ he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
\"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,\" he said, while referring to Russia as a \"magic of a single trick\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the \"inadequate\" - North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a \"prisoner\" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic motives, which is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers - Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren - will analyse deeply - the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will \"examine deeply\" the possibility of applying for the presidency following the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the ultimate manager,” said The Hill.
\"After 6 November, I will thoroughly examine the possibility of applying for the presidency.\"
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that - of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote -
However, a survey conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not in the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ probable voters stated that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% give their support to your application.
The survey showed greater support for an application by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidature and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party debated for a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after her enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
\"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify myself with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with,\" said Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention - the elephant in the room - and said that his son and other veterans - turn a little different, become hardened, ask again if there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country -
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and possession of a gun as alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a statement of friendly curiae (court friends) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, said NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union intervened in August against the policy was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner - and his children, members of a violent gang - abused her, but the U.S. authorities ignored her application for asylum on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the US, such as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Resources allowing immigrants without documents escaped from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy - ignores decades of state, federal and international laws -
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle - read in the statement amicius curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and - make the necessary labour available -
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” said Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-watch to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
- Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water -
Residents who returned to their homes destroyed were found to try to save everything they could find among their water soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake struck him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe - Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope you're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of \"intimidation\" with \"advertising announcements\"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily at Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most printout of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the 6th November elections for Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in declarations to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now holding an ever more intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff vacancies on imports from the other.
China's retaliation tariffs in the early stages of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American specialists say.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article on the Sunday's Des Moines Register, - is now putting your foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisements in our free press -
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press publishing a paid announcement at the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
\"On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
In addition, he added that - one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish - his article, although he did not mention what.
Republicans alienate female voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the appointment for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that such a reaction may lead to a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the mid-term elections to take place soon.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and the majority of Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move towards a vote.
These things have no setback - from this to The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that he doubted that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to appease the revolted voters.
\"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November - mentioned on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang - November is at the door - when they demonstrated in the Senate atrium, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, told the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat every record,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no partisan affiliation.
- People say it's high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the undecided voters in the suburban areas and the youngest voters, aged 18-29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote -
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointed to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction might occur if Republicans advanced with confirmation.
\"This became a scam for the Republican Party,\" said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans dealt with the matter and how they treated it,\" said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats, the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford's testimony or probably, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford said under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the appointment to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two were attending a party during the period when they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to \"dominating the world\"
\"We have to do this now,\" he said with regard to the startup.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own - personal online data store - or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that it is only up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it \"personal capacity through data\"
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteering programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to the-Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all his business models are turned from one day to the other.
- We're not asking them for permission -
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I'm incredibly optimistic about this coming era of the Web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergyman decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his birthplace 100 years ago.
Lieutenant-Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons got down a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, claimed that it was (brightly symbolic) that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Coronel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal - a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns -
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the greatest courage, led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and slaughtering three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Coronel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were - something I know he could never match, but also a lesson in humility -
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honoured to participate in the parade, and added that the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people.
Joint martial arts fans woke up all night to see the Bellator 206 watch instead the Pig Peppa
Imagine this: it stays up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of celebrities and, in the end, it is prevented from seeing the main event.
St. Joseph's series included 13 fights, with six of the main group, and was being exhibited live during the night in the United Kingdom, in Channel 5.
At six in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were amazed when the cover moved to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they were up until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as \"a kind of bad joke\"
The government's regulation says that the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another programming - said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing hairdress and communications, when asked about the transmission.
- Porca Peppa - feeling
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will rectify the schedule of transmissions to include in the future the United Kingdom's spectators.
\"I think when I think about the repetition, I think we can solve the problem,\" Coker said.
But it's six Sunday mornings there and we won't be able to solve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fighting to five instead of six, as we normally do, and try to exceed the expectations of the fans and we've exaggerated.
It's a pitiful situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about her sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley stated that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he didn't notice until he entered high school that - not everyone is like me -
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was in favour of homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The long-standing regular programme presenter, Kirsty Young, took a break for several months due to illness.
When appearing as a pariah in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt inferior to everyone else because - it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls -
In your words, until today, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason you gave me the power and the strength to achieve success.
His goal was to prove that he was (someone) said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he expressed himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give others hope.
The world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, \"took me by surprise\"
Daley married the last year with the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he said the age difference never constituted a problem.
“When we went so far when we were so young,” he said, “his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who went through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that she had changed her whole outlook.
\"If you asked me last year, all that mattered was \"get a gold medal,\" he said.
There are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had already the tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell you that you won't be around to be in the front row, Dad,\" he said.
\"I was holding him back when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
\"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics...there was no better feeling,\" he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had been identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson in low form at the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he fights his 47th match in a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the score from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on the fourballs and Saturday's foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so many times been in the teams of the United States, the five times winner of the male main championships divided the day between the support function and the work in their game in the field, in the hope of rectifying what afflicts him.
Having never beaten the most straight even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering strokes.
And if the camp alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with the initiator Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 single sets, record a good start, Mickelson's departure can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a respected champion who gave these teams a lot in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought of more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, just like everyone else --
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of its individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
\"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room,\" he explained.
I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just playing —
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his big advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership when entering the last day of singles at the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental walk.
The Danish had its debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesters held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the goal line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
\"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little,\" said Bjorn, in the image, after having attended the 2018 Turma victory by 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do all right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I've always said that I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world -
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters are the individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're leaving the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well -
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look for their players to have a better performance individually than partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself has already been on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ends up losing when Europe took out of the booklet on “Milagre in Medinah”
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, the pressure is too great in these middle breaks.
We've organized our effective in accordance and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main match, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ordination.
“I listened to this group of players by this order because I think it covers the entire route,” Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German Warship once again postponed
The latest fragata of the German navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time. However, it will be necessary to wait for at least until next year, due to fault-prone systems and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", the command ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that cited a military spokesperson.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment missiles, as well as some furtive technologies such as the reduction of radar signatures, infrared and acoustics.
Other important features include more dilated periods between maintenances, which would allow to send the latest frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the state-of-the-art warships, considered to be a way for Germany to design power beyond borders, to be outdated when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a series of \"hardware and software defects\" crucial that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, since the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz has twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it will have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase in the face of the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems facing the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used -
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as they were put out of service older ships without any boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands in order to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long ear chestnuts and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the activities of bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by specialists of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the calls of bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have fallen considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, together with the moss-papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is by them that they use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitory inspections and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reservation in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
\"Here in Three we have an excellent area for bats,\" he said.
We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats we don't know about, so the work we've developed here and in the other properties will help us to learn more about what they need to flourish.
It was uplifted by him the importance of verifying whether there are bats before making maintenances on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 female and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was for her that she said: \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are revengeing.\"
Ronaldo dismisses charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as - false news - claiming that people - they want to promote themselves - using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that you will then pay $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read at Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a direct video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the reports as \"false news\"
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news - told the camera the winner of five Gold Balls.
They want to promote themselves at the cost of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right - he added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which have characterized as - an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy - according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years -
The alleged incident will have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga will have allegedly gone to the player's room, where the player has violated her on an annual basis, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that it was -99% - - a good type - damaged by - one percent -
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and possessed photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he would later agree to enter an extrajudicial agreement for feeling \"feel terrified by the prospect of retaliation\" and be concerned about the possibility of \"being publicly humiliated\"
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian Juve giants in a 100 million euros business.
Brexit: United Kingdom - would forever - lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom - would be forever - if it lost its status as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit - said the Secretary for Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
\"We need an agreement,\" said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to job loss.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that, if Britain goes disorderly out of the EU at the end of March, we will be watching production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis with the parts reaching every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for autos manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production would have to stop.
Clark stated that the ‘Chequers Plan’ of Theresa May for future relations with the EU was — precisely able to avoid these checks at the border —
We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use for us of this opportunity - said to the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers point out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful supply chain set”
Although it could not give an estimate of the stop time, Toyota stated that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead, sooner or later, to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and co-ordinates the United Union in this place, said that its members are increasingly concerned: \"According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said that \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU\"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be - another week postponed - given that there is still no understanding as to what Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's advisors and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the deputy attorney general's dismissal, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of concealing talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that \"I'd rather not say goodbye\" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Commission hearing in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation with the duration of a week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, participated in the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press up-to-date.
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the \"protagonism\" of television reporters, although he said: \"I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonistism\"
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The President asked more questions and answers than any previous president - he added, without adding any evidence: \"We have examined these numbers -
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this frequently and they have seen that we have done it in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference -
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, he appeared casually and sometimes bizarrely before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months from the exit of the EU United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to costing applications for the resident status of EU citizens working in the country's decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, and decisions were expected for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to continue here -
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injuries
The defence of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in the defeat of Saturday by 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ, of the Tigers.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
“He approached the side line and virtually fainted,” Reed reported.
The technical team and the medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying it on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury, and that the team is trying to find out when this occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five plazas on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total of the season to 18 plazas.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers by purchasing properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to collect a higher stamp tax from foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The rise in the stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless, will today announce Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and to rate higher incomes.
The rise in stamp tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second houses and purchases for rent - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new constructions in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for first-home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become - ghost cities - because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices of high properties when landing land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs May leave the quotas on accessible housing to solve the - disgraceful housing - in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of evictions - without justification -
It also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Ms. May said: \"Last year I stated that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is so easy to buy homes for people who live outside the UK and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of owning your home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep behind the lewd remains too real.
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland.\"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross stated that his \"last ambition\" is to come to be Scotland's selective.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving a new life to the club in the northeast, currently third ranked in the First League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the first Scottish division in the past time.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B - Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound program.
I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs -
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel afraid by succeeding the names so consecrated in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"For me, at the moment success is summed up \"I can take the club back to Premier League\"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League - he said.
\"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll only consider that I've been successful here when I reach that goal.\"
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as Deputy coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped the Alloa to recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the title of the champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever he felt during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa - it was a real crossroads - remembers.
\"I've always seen myself more in the role of a coach than in the role of a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I won my life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt throughout my adult life.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, show statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of the good time and career of England at the World Cup of Football, longer than expected, made the pattern of June, in which pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a decline.
The decrease of 1.8% recorded in restoration sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the liquor-based business had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the descent of restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also encountered difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased 6.6% throughout the month, with meals falling by 3% -
Paul Newman, from the leisure sector analyst and RSM restoration, said: “These results extend the trend we have experienced since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual sales drop of 4.8% is particularly harmful when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer couldn't get to the worst time for the operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the most threatening temperatures we know in August will provide the much desired relief -
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in five hidden children of parents secret accounts on social media
One in five children - some only 11 years old - has secret accounts on social networks that hides from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of the pages - false - on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they had a \"principal\" account to show parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - creates accounts on the social networks that hides from adults.
An inquiry of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of accounts - false - on the Instagram photo sharing website.
The news aggravates the fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a “principal” account innocuous to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teenagers were pushing the others to \"violate her\"
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of the young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"Athletes' Voice\" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Governor's Annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most successful practitioner of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
\"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and World athletic community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain with their presence in the Council,\" said Beattie.
Doyle said: \"I'm excited to be able to act like the athletes' voice and I hope I can really contribute to help guide sport in Scotland.\"
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre test at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, which is currently a regular commentator on BBC, stopped being able to walk after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It was a month ago that I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if you could recover and to what extent.
It's been a hard job but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk and even I've already done agility exercises!

Milk extraction pump announcement compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A dairy pump company divided online reviews with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in the larfa.
To mark the launch of what is described as the \"first portable silent milk extraction pump\" the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance on a hay-filled cowry to the sound of a song that includes verses such as: \"Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have tail\" and -You haven't noticed, I don't have boobs, these are my breasts -
The saying goes on: \"Bombea, pump, baby food, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls.\"
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the spectators, with many saying that it matches the \"horrors\" of the dairy sector.
‘You decide to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their babies are stolen a few days after they were born - wrote a specter.
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly within a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Understandingly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, because you don't use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies -
Someone also said: \"An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity\"
Others defended the ad, as a woman who admitted to finding the song - hilarious -
- I think it's a great idea.
If you were still breast-feeding, you'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great - wrote one of the women.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad addressed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like “vacs”
It is not an ad to be praised or to judge the sector of the laticinos -
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with pumps claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly within a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, catch their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the bridge to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children peaked, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult for children to join in.
Traditionally, most of the \"fathers\" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to mate a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults who integrate their family members would have to record their fingerprints, and the data shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before the Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
‘About 80% of the sponsors or members of their family members are illegal in the country, and many of them foreigners are criminally registered.
That's why we're going to continue to pursue these individuals - Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the above rule, in accordance with the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to the signs of disruption of children being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many have already discussed.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Mr Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally found on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and will be treated as such.
\"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,\" he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror is almost over - in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions of displaced people still.
He said that Damascus would continue to \"shout this sacred battle until we release all Syrian territories - from terrorist groups as well as from - all and any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were ensured, accusing some Western countries of “spare irrational fears” that led refugees to remain abroad.
\"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib's last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack of the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established - clear times - and expressed hope that the military action would target the jiadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will be eradicated -
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to revision of the articles of the current constitution, and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the challenge and scandals will end his presidency in advance.
In that which would undoubtedly constitute the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of the showers' fatigue.
Since 2014, hearings in November more than doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in prime hours, a rise from 1.7 million years ago four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
\"This is a strong caller for people because it's something we don't understand,\" said Neal Baer, ABC's programme producer, Designated Survivor, about a chief of staff who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedian veteran and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys — Club — has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote Trump.
\"Why,\" she asked.
He said, \"Because he makes me laugh,\" Scovell told me.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when we are watching the sixth hour of a specialist debate on the use by Bob Woodward of sources - with deep knowledge - in his book -Fear - the $15,000 ostrich leather blouse by Paul Manafort - a piece of clothing filled with insolence - as the Washington Post said) and the implications of the grim descriptions of Stormy Daniels of... hum... anatomy by President Trump.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario again in the same way.
\"Part of what he's done seems like a reality show because he gives us something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of \"Pawn Stars\" about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily spinovers of the plot (adtagonize with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episodes or we can stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not neglect television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate's Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
\"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all.

Significant external funding in the mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th circle is familiar with an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburgh placed in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is a candidate against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old circles were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race through the 17th circle sparked a tough dispute over campaign financing between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely contested March extraordinary elections for the 18th electoral circle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
The analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The USA considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm encounter with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the \"recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,\" said Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the State Department, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development were considered.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific restrictions on visas, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in the middle of September, top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to move on, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson for Mr Bolton for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the legal advisor Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation to ascertain whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to present himself to the voters again and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable - or that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the combat.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or held.
Americans currently face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to perform the job.
Rosenstein says The Times news is incorrect.
How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall in these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance of these, how could it not be optimistic about our future -

Graham Dorrans from the Optimistic Rangers before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the tie to two greedy with the Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
\"It was a point well earned by us because Villarreal is a good team,\" said the 31-year-old player.
\"We have dealt with the game with a positive mindset and we have gained a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but in global terms, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trainings run well.
I hope that we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success -
Women are losing sleep with fear of this saving-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea about the type of care they want to take, few people spoke to their families about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationalwide study referred to talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
\"People want a family member to take care of you, but they're not having this conversation,\" said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance branch.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not give them knowledge of your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and with your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get your financial consultant involved: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their options for financing continued care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover these costs or funding through their own savings, provided that they have these available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care attorney, choosing a person from your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a procuration on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
\"Not only financial matters are at stake, but who are the doctors,\" asked Martin.
- What's the medication?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare these plans —

Sismos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities were told, and the number of deaths was expected to increase.
With interrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends over 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with an administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Sulawesi Central Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but concentrates mostly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, resulted in a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, resulting in a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, unleashing a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died underground under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for accusations of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin was previously detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bail, reported to KTU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring, of course, innocent, he reported to the station.
Palin is facing charges for three class A crimes, which means that he can be sentenced to up to one year's sentence and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable with a day's jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress due to her service in Iraq.
Sism and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, waiting for the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutors Request Rare Capital Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor seeks the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to execute an attack in October, on a bicycle at West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and inflicted, intentionally, serious injuries, in accordance with the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a \"considerable planning and premeditation\" told the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed him as \"atroz, cruel and depraved\"
“Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco — refers to the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York hadn't asked for the death penalty for an accusation.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spy acts in favour of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documentation, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, referred to the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
“We think that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to immobilize the popular army during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should - feel the pressure - of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative deputy of rear Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom - would have already left - had Farage been Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionaries was underlined by the conservatives who defend the stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debating himself to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit's supporters, the advocates of permanence and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the -caos -
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull's meeting that he intended - to end the Plan -
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he was responsible, we would have gone out,\" he said.
Mr de Wellingborough added: \"I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.\"
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: \"We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country -
Bone refused the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally out of control”
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to the journalists: \"I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who lead the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequer Plane and start listening —
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: \"Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs\"
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should - feel the pressure - if they rush to betray the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
\"This has become a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it.\"
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that it will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom -
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted tracks with the message \"Conservatives Against Brexit\" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of the Workers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the congress.
\"These are the people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the unattried border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,\" he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit - concluded.
Warren planned - seriously - for possible nomination to President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will - seriously weight the candidacy to the President - after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, Trump's co-mandator of the 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the format of debate since Trump took over.
One of the participants asked him whether he was planning to apply for the Presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman in the top place.
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player murder, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims took a bullet in his head, following which he ended up dying,” said the chief of police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence on the scene, pushing a gun, acknowledging having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a junior of 1.98 meters created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held 10 times last time, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recovers per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following the team's orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind defending his position on the first two turns, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the pits a bit later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton passed him after a renived scan, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the inner part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself on the third bend.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, switching too late from tires, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxes on the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end in room.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me overstep him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to end up in the first two positions, said Hamilton.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday due to his insistence that he would not have disclosed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are -more, malicious and false -
\"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at anger, see how bad, malicious and false people are,\" Trump said.
When we see the leaks and the announcements and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did she run away from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't come from me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape departed from us... no, it wasn't us - it added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred at the beginning of September, but he denied that the leak had left his office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story,\" said Feinstein to the Commission, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected your request\"
But his dissension did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's session: \"They know that more, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the appointment for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats would be using the charges in their behalf.
They are determined to resume power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, wickedness, it does not matter who can reach, who have to step in to take over power and control, said the President, according to the Mediaite.

Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers would take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many still disappeared after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to take over the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower ran violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was then on the runway, was safely off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, faced with the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation agency, Yohannes Sirit, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television chain ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the disaster management agency in the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue,” said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse —
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday. Second sources of the CNN, he addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Early this year, Lombok Island in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took over more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline in charge of the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after he reported that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that, from Saturday afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Official entities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is still not known for sure what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was on track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
\"It was the best thing that happened,\" Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to crawl with the water through the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a little head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, the sailors who were working in a work of improving a nearby wet also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the history of the evening events when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in the Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstitute the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained localization data from several mobile phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously provided.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville -
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
\"He turned her off from her life,\" Hale declared.
The defence should start presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he was hoping that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.

A trio of hip hop wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling in its music of positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed Group states that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
New York Lady processes couples for dismissal through a message SMS-racist
A New York housewife is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she has mistakenly received a message from her mother complaining that she was a black woman.
The couple denied the accusations of racism, stating that the process was an act of \"extortion\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, demonstrated some fear when she discovered that the new nurse Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE... BUT A PRETA” wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized his gafe, a \"embarrassed\" - Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the bad performance of the previous African-American mistress and who was waiting for a Filipino housewife.
Giselle Maurice was paid for his only day of work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a cancellation compensation of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which he had been chosen without a contract.
\"I want to show you that you cannot be unpunished,\" he said to the Post on Friday, adding, \"I know this is discrimination.\"
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that saying goodbye Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared that they could not trust her after they offended her.
My wife sent him something I really didn't mean.
You're not a racist.
We are not racist people - Joel Plasco said to the Post.
- Would your children trust someone who had treated badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it.
By surnameing the process of \"extortion\" Plasco said that his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with - a very difficult situation -
- Are they going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice - added the investment banker.
While the legal process takes place, the court of public opinion has been celebs by condemning the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the editors of Paddington feared that readers might not identify themselves with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: \"It is difficult to put ourselves in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this right now, after Paddington was so successful —
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had an agrid flavor given its passing last year.
About Paddington, who described himself as a very important member of our family, said that his father was very proud of his success.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabaroly,” he said.
“But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a successful son: we are proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself -
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her cell phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad often phoned to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperese said.
So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said \"Tashi, I love you very much my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly giving up and leaving his system.
He had been dead for a while and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or mourn because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on to myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperese, now in mourning for her daughter's loss, embarked on the plane along with other passengers to the test for what she was going through.
\"No one knew,\" he said.
I've always cried with a low head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt great compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women mourning post cards on bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
\"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day,\" he said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chief with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everybody said it lit up the hall.
However, he gave up his work before he died because he had — immersed himself in darkness —
In 2014, Tyler was found killed by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, \"I'm always worried about a possible impact.\"
Sharon Davis created the postcards - so they know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't close yourselves.
Kelly Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after the mother-in-law's death.
\"I didn't say I was sad or depressed,\" she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in your behavior.
On Christmas day, there was a rag, when the kids opened the gifts, they didn't even look at them.
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: \"Destroy a family.
Nobody gets indifferent.
But we all have to keep on living and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
\"I thought we could be more united,\" said Jeff Flake on Saturday, \"going forward to fear that the commission would - fall apart - face an entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't they want Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters to investigate the FBI?
Your reluctance is a purely temporary matter.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not true that Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote on the release and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
By citing data from the Ministry of the Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
As a rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of deserters in North Korea.
Seoul reported that over 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DNZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal and non-refugeal emigrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations in an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general lines, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearised Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse links to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a loud and soluble voice, speaking of his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the committee's Democrats, appealing to the allegations made against him of a grotesque and conspiracy murder, organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton who lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court given his prejudiced conduct against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was afraid of potential Kavanaugh opinions against the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare - or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of revocation of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
\"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision,\" Pelosi said.
Women must be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it can't unravel without crying.
\"We cry when we get angry,\" said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's strange, you don't think\"
A woman with an executive position in a company who helped me a lot told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself, it's brilliant.
Tears are accepted when expressing anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I cried with unexpressed anger, being held by the neck by an older woman - a manager nothing friendly that terrified me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
\"Never let them see you cry\"
- They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy they've managed to affect you.
Patricia Schroeder, the Congressman Democratic of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his nomination to the presidents.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-marital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
\"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision,\" he said to laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who nicknamed the situation of - The Snow White and the Seven Years - -
Given its late entry, the fundraising was far from desirable and swore that it would only enter the race if it could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they had given 1,000 to male candidates.
\"You think I'm entitled to a discount,\" he asked.
When he announced that he was not going to enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raised so many obstacles to fundraising and to bring the message to the voters, rather than the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
“It seemed to me that she was depressed,” said Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the reaction of the media.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you now write in my epitaph?
“She cried — —
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the experts, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by charging major Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), actually charging half of all goods sent by China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently rising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to following the U.S. steps and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will waver in the near future.
Moving back to Washington would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing the U.S. a public subservience would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the US can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
\"In fact, the fact that an unintended political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than the observers could ever have anticipated,\" said Abigail Grace, an investigator associated with the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
\"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Selection beats the US and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the surroundings of Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they defeated Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is again crowned victorious after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reaches the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst-rated player of the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best-rated player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England in which it may have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
\"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy I was able to help - said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the North American Gulf legend, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
\"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record on the Ryder Cup.
Unknown statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 major winning titles and just beat by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were debated for reaching the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team.
This morning, we managed to scare Europe.
We fought.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to get my hat off the other team.
They were better -
